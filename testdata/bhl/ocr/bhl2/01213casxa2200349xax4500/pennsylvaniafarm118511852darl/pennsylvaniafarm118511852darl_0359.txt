If the weather be fine, she may he stationed where 
 you choose, by a long piece of ilannel-list tied round 
 one leg, and fastened to a stump or a stone. But the 
 boarded coop saves her ever-watchful anxiety from 
 the dread of enemies above and behind — the carion- 
 crow, the hawk, the rat, the weasel : and also pro- 
 tects herself — and will protect her young from the 
 sudden showers of summer. Offer at first a few 
 crumbs of bread : the little ones, for some hours, will 
 be in no hurry to eat ; but when they do begin, sup- 
 ply them constantly and abundantly with chopped 
 egg, shreds of meat and fat, curd, boiled rice mixed 
 with cress, lettuce, aud the green of onions. Melted 
 mutton-suet poured over barley-meal and cut up when 
 cold : also bullock's liver boiled and minced, are ex- 
 cellent things. Barley-meal, mixed thick and stiff 
 with water or milk, nettle-tops, leeks, goose-grass, or 
 cleavers, and many other things, might be added to 
 the list ; but it is probable that a few of these may 
 now and then be refused by gome fanciful little 
 rogues. I think I have observed that little Turkeys 
 do not like their food to be minced much smaller than 

they can swallow it: indolently preferring to make a 
 meal at three or four mouthfuls than to trouble 
 themselves with the incessant pecking and scratching 
 in which Chickens so much delight. But, any rate, 
 the quantity consumed costs nothing : the attention 
 to supply it is every thing. — Dixon & Kerr's Orna-

THE GUINEA FOWL. 

This Bird, in some measure, unites the character- 
 istics of the Pheasant and the Turkey, it has the del- 
 icate shape of the one and the bare head of the other. 
 There are several varieties, as the White, the Spotted, 
 the Madagascar, and the Crested. This latter is not 
 so large as the common species : the head and neck 
 are bare, of a dull blue, shaded with red, and, instead 
 of a casque, it has an ample crest of hairy-like disu- 
 nited feathers, of a bluish black, reaching as far for- 
 ward as the nostrils, but in general turned backwards. 
 " The whole plumage, except the quills, is of a bluish 
 black, covered with small grayish spots, sometimes 
 four, sometimes six on each feather." 


THE GUINEA FOWL. 

The best way to begin keeping Guinea Fowls is to 
 procure a sitting of Eggs from some friend or neigh- 
 bour on whom you ean depend for their freshness, 
 and also, if possible, from a place ichere only a sin- 
 gle pair is kepi. The reason of this will be explain- 
 ed hereafter. A Bantam Hen is the best mother ; 
 she is lighter, and less likely to injure them by tread- 
 ing on them than a full sized Fowl. She will cover 
 nine Eggs and incubation will last a month. The 
 young are excessively pretty. When first hatched, 
 they are so strong and active as to appear not to re- 
 quire the attention really necessary to rear them. — 
 Almost as soon as they are dry from the moisture of 
 the Egg, they will peck each other's toes, as if suppo- 
 sing them to be worms, will scramble with each other 
 for a crumb of bread, and will domineer over any 
 little Bantam or Chicken that may perhaps have been 
 brought off in the same clutch with themselves. No 
 one, who did not know, would guess, from their ap- 

pearance, of what species of bird they were the off- 
 spring. 

Of all known birds, this, perhaps, is the most pro- 
 lific of Eggs. AVeek after week, and month after 
 month, sees no, or very rare intermission of the daily 
 deposit. Even the process of moulting is sometimes 
 insufficient to draw off the nutriment the creature 
 takes to make feathers instead of Eggs, and the poor 
 thing will sometimes go about half naked in the chilly 
 autumnal months, like a Fowl that had escaped from 
 the cook to avoid a preparation for the spit; unable 
 to refrain from its diurnal visit to the nest, and con- 
 sequently unable to furnish itself with a great coat. 
 As the body of a good cow is a distillery for convert- 
 ing all sorts of herbage into milk, and nothing else, 
 or as little else as possible, so the body ef the Guinea 
 Hen is a most admirable machine for producing Eggs 
 out of insects, vegetables, grain, garbage, or what- 
 ever an omnivorous creature can lay hold of. — Dixon
