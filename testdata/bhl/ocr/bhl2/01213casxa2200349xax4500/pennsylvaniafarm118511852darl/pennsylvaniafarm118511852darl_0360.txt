Chiefly in reference to an Agriculhiral henejit.

CONCLUDED. 

Other insects of a different Order often commit ex- 
 tensive ravages on our staple crops. 

Wheat, so essential in its diversified forms of man- 
 ipulation to our comfort and sustenance, and consti- 
 tuting^ what is emphatically termed the staff of life, 
 is subject to the depredations of man}' insects. Some 
 of the most destructive of these are the Hessian Fly, 
 fCeoidomyia destructor,) the Grange-colored Gnat, 
 (Cecidomyia tritici,) Miss Morris' wheat midge, {Ce- 
 cidomyiaculmicola,) the Joint-worm, the Augoumois 
 moth, and the AVolf, (Tinea grauella). These insects 
 are pernicious only in their larva state; and each at- 
 tacks a separate and distinct part of the plant. 

The larva or maggot of the Hessian Fly is usually 
 found between the base of the leaf and the main stalk. 
 Two_ broods of this insect are produced annually — 
 one in the spring and one in the autumn. In Oeto- 
 ber, the female deposites from twenty to thirty eggs, 
 on the leaves of wheat, soon after the plant appears 
 above the ground. These eggs are cylindrical in form, 
 of a pale red color, one-fiftieth of an inch long, and 
 one-five-hundredth of an inch in their transverse dia- 
 meter. _ They are hatched in from four to fifteen days. 
 The diminutive maggot, at first of a reddish color, 
 crawls down the leaf, insinuating itself between it 
 and the main stalk, till it reaches a joint, where it re- 
 mains, with its head downwards. It continues sta- 
 tionary in this situation, sucking {lie juices of the 
 2>lant, for four or five weeks, when it becomes fully 
 grown, measures an eighth of an inch in length, and 
 ce.ases to cat. The skin now hardens, assumes a 
 bright chestnut color, and has some resemblance to 
 a flax-seed. In this flax-seed or pupa state it remains 
 till April or May, when it becomes transformed into 
 the perfect or winged insect. Copulation then takes 
 place, soon after which the eggs for the autumn 
 brood arc laid. 

The larv« of the Orange-colored Gnat are found in 
 the ears of wheat; where they feed on the pollen, and 
 the germ destined to form the future grain, till they 
 complete their growth. Then, after moulting, they 
 fall to the_ ground, where they burrow to the depth 
 of half an inch and undergo their final metamorphosis. 
 The perfect insect does not emerge from its pupa case 
 in the ground till May or June ; when it makes its ap- 
 pearance about the time the wheat is in blossom, and 
 after copulation lays its eggs in the scales of the flo- 
 rets or in the center of the corolla. In eight or ten 
 days, these eggs are hatched into, little footless mag- 
 gots; which, when fully grown, are an eighth of an 
 inch long. By ^feeding on the pollen, they essential- 
 ly interfere with the fecundating process, and thus 
 occasion many of the grains to be abortive. In this 
 way, a twentieth part of the crop, not unfrequently, 
 IS destroyed by them. 

The larva of Miss Morris' wheatrmidge inhabits the 
 cavity in the center of the straw. In June, the egg 
 IS deposited in the grain while in the soft or milky 
 state, and remains unhatched till the wheat has been 
 sown and has germinated. The young larva soon 
 ascends the stalk, which it penetrates above the top 
 joint, and enters the cavity in the centre of the culm, 
 ■where it feeds, with its head doivnwards, till it ac- 
 quires its full growth. It then passes down the cen- 
 ter of the straw, cutting through the joints, till it 
 reaches the root, when it emerges from the interior 

of the culm, ascends the stalk on the outside, attaches 
 itself firmly to the straw, passes into the flax-seed or 
 pupa state in its larval skin, and completes its final 
 change in May or June. Before the larva arrives at ma- 
 turity, the straw very frequently becomes so hard, that 
 the worm, when done feeding, is unable to cut through 
 the joints and make its exit at the root in its usual 
 way. Under these circumstances, its transformations 
 are completed within the cavity of the culm, where the 
 imago must eventually perish, unless liberated from 
 its confinement by some fortuitous means. Thus it 
 appears, as Miss Morris has remarked in her commu- 
 nications to the American Philosophical Society, and 
 to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, 
 that this destructive insect may be transported from 
 place to place, and even from one country to another, 
 in wheat straw, as well as in the wheat itself The 
 Cecidomyia culmicola has been confounded with the 
 true Hessian fly, which it resembles in appearance, 
 and perhaps equals in its destructive ravages on the 
 wheat crop. Under the impression that Miss Morris 
 was describing the Cecidomyia destructor, her facts 
 were called in question, and a controversy ensued. — 
 The accuracy, however, of her observations have been 
 triumphantly established ; and it is now conceded 
 that the insect described by her is one which had es- 
 caped the notice of other Entomologists. 

The larva of the joint- worm dwells in the paren- 
 chyma or substance of the sheath, near its junction 
 with the stalk; and can only be seen by cutting into 
 the excrescence or blistered spot which constitutes its 
 abode. Whether or not this insect prevails to any 
 extent in Pennsylvania I am unable to inform you. 
 But in some parts ef Virginia, the injury done to the 
 wheat crop is sometimes very considerable. 

The Angoumois moth and the TFoT/'are two insects 
 of another Order (Lepidoptera) that occasionally in 
 their larva state attack the growing wheat ; though 
 their principal depredations are committed on the 
 grain stored in garners. 

Several insects, belonging to the Coleopterous Or- 
 der, also do incalculable injury to stored up grain. — 
 The most destructive of these is that which has been 
 pre-eminently termed " the weevil " (Calandra gran- 
 aria), one of the Rhyncophora. It is a minute insect, 
 only one eighth of an inch long. The female depo- 
 sites a single egg in each grain, the interior of which 
 is entirely consumed by the larva. 

It has often been observed, that when the insects, 
 justj noticed, as attacking the wheat crop, have in- 
 creased to an alarming extent, a diminution in their 
 numbers suddenly and unexpectedly takes place, cau- 
 sing the wheat fields on the ensuing year to be, in a 
 great measure, exempt from their depredations.* — 
 Several causes combine to produce this happy and 
 unanticipated result. To one of them — insect ene- 
 mies — your attention will now be directed. These 
 enemies are the Ichneumons, — a tribe of insects, be- 
 longing to the Hymenopterous Order, and embracing 
 many genera and species. They are all parasites ; 
 and by checking the increase of the herbivorous or 
 plant-feeding insects, prove the great insect benefac- 

*Since the above was written, I have received a copy of the 
 Transactions of 1850 of the N. Y. State Agricultural Society, 108 
 pages of which are occupied with an able Report of an Agricultural 
 Survey of the county of Seneca, taken under the direction of the 
 State Society, by John Deiafield, Esq. From this report we make 
 the following extract : *' In the year 1849, the Wheat crops of Ju- 
 nius, Tyre, Waterloo. Seneca Falls and Fayette, exhibited theef- 
 fect of the wheat fly's presence, they destroyed nearly one-fifth 
 of the crops of these towns. In 1950 the evil was abated, and but 
 little loss experienced ; this immunity was unexpected, and it is 
 worthy of enquiry by Entomologists, how far the climate, season 
 and condition of the crops may have presented obstacles to the ea- 
 sy deposit of the egg, or what other cause so suddenly and effectu- 
 ally checkjd the increase of the wheat fly."
