REMARKS ON ENTOMOLOGY. 

[March, 

tance. It cannot for a moment bo presumed that 
 our practical agriculturists, whose time is so thorough- 
 ly occupied by the cares and labors of their husbandry 
 operations, have the leisure or inclination to glean it 
 from the massive and voluminous tomes on Entomol- 
 ogy, written as tliey are, for the most part, in lan- 
 guage unintelligible to them. It is true, several 
 valuable European publications, of a popular charac- 
 ter, on insects destructive to vegetation have been is- 
 sued. Among these are Ratzeburg's " Die Forst* 
 Insecten ;'' published at Berlin ; and a treatise on 
 "insects injurious to gardeners, foresters, and farm- 
 ers" prepared under the auspices of the Austrian 
 Government, by Vincent Koller, and translated from 
 tiie German by J. and M. Loudon, with notes by J. 
 0. Westwood. Most of the insects described in these 
 works, however, are peculiar to the Old World, or are 
 less abundant and less destructiTe with us, than some 
 others that are indigenous to our own country. 

Being impressed with the great importance ofh.av- 
 ing the animal, vegetable and mineral productions 
 and resources of the State fully developed, Massachu- 
 setts, so early as 1830, authorized the commencement 
 of a series of investigations, which resulted in the 
 publication, at the expense of her Commonwealth, 
 of several valu.able documents, having an agricultural 
 bearing. Among these is an able Report by Dr. T. 
 W. Harris, on the insects of Massachusetts injurious 
 to vegetation, issued in 1841, more than ten years 
 ago. The history of this Report was communicated 
 to me in a letter, from this distingui.shed Entomolo- 
 gist, in reply to one I had written to him on the .sub- 
 ject, and is of so interesting a character as to induce 
 me to lay it before you.* In it you will perceive that 
 Massachusetts, not satisfied with the entomological 
 information which she had caused to be widely diffu- 
 sed, among her agi-icultural population, has already 
 authorized the publication of another edition of this 
 useful work. On this second edition, which will no 
 doubt be much enlarged and greatly improved, the 
 accomplished author is now engaged.* 

Will Pennsylvania do less for the advancement of 
 her agricultural interests than the Bay State has 
 done for those of Massachusetts ? We trust not. — 
 An able Entomological Report, written in familiar 
 language and adapted to the exigencies of our own 
 Commonwealth, would impart to her rural population 
 the entomological knojiledge they so much need and 
 ought to possess. Then would they be able to recog- 
 nise the insects that at times produce so much injury 
 to their crops, as well as those that are of a beneficial 
 tendency. Then would they bo furnished with the 
 most approved natural and artificial means of com- 
 bating their destructive ravages. 

Such a report would also accomplish other results 
 quite as important as those now mentioned. By im- 
 parting general and correct views of insect life, a 
 spirit of enquiry and investigation into the economy, 
 habits and transformations of the many insects with- 
 in our borders would be engendered. Close, attentive, 
 and well directed observation on these points, by our 
 agriculturists, would probably lead to the adoption 
 of more efficient counteracting remedies against in- 
 sect depredations than any hitherto employed. 

Permit me, tlien, to press upon you th eimportance 
 of urging our State Government to legislate at once 
 on this subject. Let a bill be laid before the General 
 Assembly, during its present session, making the ne- 
 cessary provision for appointing an Entomologist 
 to draw up a Report on the Insects of Pennsylvania 
 injurious to vegetation, as well as those that are ben- 
 eficial, with outlines or colored illustrations represen- 
 ting them in every form of their e.xistence. The 
 triumphant passage of a bill of this kind cannot for 
 a moment be doulated.* 

In connection with this subject, the propriety of 
 recommending legal enactments for the protection of 
 Insectivorous birds, is also worthy of your calm and 
 serious deliberation. 

Sooner or later, these and various other measures! 
 necessary to the elevation of the agricultural p sition 
 of our Commonwealth, must and will be carried out. 
 The only question is as to time. Whether their ac- 
 complishment be remote, or nigh at hand, must in a 
 great measure, depend on the zeal and energy with 
 which the State Society urges their consummation. — 
 The present moment is auspicious ; agriculture is 
 every where receiving an onward impulse ! — down- 
 trodden as are the masses in the despotic governments 
 of Europe, yet are the agricultural communities even 
 of those countries now receiving from their Rulers, 
 aid the most important — -the most efiicient.J Shall 
 similar facilities be withheld from the rural popula- 
 tion of Pennsylvania? We await the response from 
 her Capitol.

DR. HARRIS' LETTER TO DR. BRINCKLE. 

Cambridge, Mass., Sept. 10, 1851. 

Dear Sir, — The report to which you refer is out of 
 print, and a new edition of it was authorized by a 
 Resolve of the General Court of Massachusetts, pas- 
 sed in May, 1850. I am now at work on this new 
 edition, the printing of which will probably be begun 
 in the course of the next winter; but as my time is 
 necessarily much taken up by my official duties in 
 the Public Library of Harvard College, the work will 
 make rather slow progress. The history of my re- 
 port is this: 

On the 5th of June, 1830, in consequence of tie 
 recommendation of His Excellency, Levi Lincoln, 
 then Governor of Massachusetts, the General Court 
 of Massachusetts, "Resolved that His Excellency, the 
 Governor, by and with the advice of the Council, be 
 and hereby is authorized to appoint some suitable 
 person to make a geological examination of the Com- 
 monwealth, in connection with the general survey, 
 &c.," which had been previously authorized, March 

*See Appendix. 

} Althoueh the State of N. York ha» nobly and generouslf incarred 
 an expenditure of nearly SIOO.UOO in her geological surveys, and 
 in acquiring and disseminating inf innatioii •oncerning her beasts, 
 birds, fishes, reptiles and shells, accompanied by beautiful and ex- 
 pensive engravings, she has liitherto done comparatively little in 
 the department of Entomology. Nevertheless, the eftbrts she is so 
 zealously and successfully making to promote her agricultural pros- 
 perity, warrant the belief, that ere long the Empire State will, 
 with her usual liberality and aagacitA', bestow on insects the con- 
 Bideratiou to which their number ant! importance entitle them. 

*Such an entomological report, in which the insects noticed are 
 arranged under their various Orders, with appropriate introductory 
 remarks to each Order, and accompanied throughout with minute 
 and comprehensive explanatory notes, would become an able Man- 
 ual of Entomology that could not fail to be productive of the most 
 eitensivs usefulness to our agricultural population. 

tSuchaa the establishment of a State Agricultural College — the 
 introduction of books on agricultural and collateral subjects into 
 the rural public schools, &c 

tit appears from the report of the Commissioners recently ap- 
 pointed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on the subject of 
 an agricultural school, that in Russia there are 68 such institutions 
 established — in Prussia 32 — Austria 3.3 — Bavaria 35 — the other 
 Germanic States 2S — Great Britain 70— France 75— Belgium 6— 
 Italy 2 ; making in aggregate of 352 European AgriculturalSchools 
 in full and successful operation. While alas, in the United States, 
 with a republican form of government which recognises, as the 
 basis of all legislation, the happiness and welfare of the people, 
 the great body of whom are engaged in rural occupations, not a 
 solitary Agricultural College or School has been established either 
 by individual States or by the National Government. Nor has an 
 Agricultural Bureau yet been organized, though it has been urgent- 
 ly solicited, and its importance and necessity universally conceded.
