3d, 1830. The Governor accordinglj commissioned 
 Prof. Edward Hitchcock, June 26, to make the Geo- 
 logical Examination and to report thereon. On the 
 •2d February, 1831, Prof. Hitchcock was directed "to 
 annex to his report a list of the native Jlinoralogical, 
 Botanical and Zoological productions of the Common- 
 wealth." This report was ordered to be printed in 
 1832, and to be distributed. The result was the first 
 edition of Prof Hitchcock's " Reports on the Geology 
 of Massachusetts," printed in one vol. octavo, at Am- 
 herst, Mass., in 1833. Before the work was finished. 
 Professor Hitchcock requested me and others to fur- 
 nish lists of animals and plants to be inserted in the 
 appendix to the work, which will be found to contain 
 my first catalogue of the insects of Massachusetts. 
 In conformity to a Resolve of the Legislature, passed 
 Feb. 17th, 1834, a new edition of Prof. Hitchcock's 
 Report was prepared in one vol, 8 vo., at Amherst, 
 in the year 1835. This contained an enlarged cata- 
 logue of the insects, which Prof. Hitchcock requested 
 me to furnish, together with catalogues of the other 
 animals and plants, prepared by several scientific 
 gentlemen. On the 12th of April, 1837, agreeably 
 to a recommendation of His Excellency, Edward Ev- 
 erett, the Governor, the General Court "Resolved 
 that the Governor, with the advice and consent of 
 the Council, is hereby authorized and requested to 
 appoint some suitable person or persons to make a 
 further and thorough survey of this Commonwealth, 
 under his direction, particularly in reference to the 
 discovery of Coal, Marl, and Ores, and an analysis 
 of the various soils of the State, relative to au agri- 
 cultural benefit. And he is hereby authorized to 
 draw his warrant from time to time, upon the Trea- 
 surer of this Commonwealth, for any sum not excee- 
 ding §2,500 for the foregoing purposes.'' The Gov- 
 ernor, mth the advice of the Council, thought best to 
 give an enlarged interpretation to this resolve, so as 
 to include as full an account of the animals and plants 
 of the Commonwealth as could be obtained consis- 
 tently with the means providod and with the spirit of 
 the resolve, which pointed particularly to the agri- 
 cultural benefits to be derived from the explorations. 
 For the execution of this resolve. Prof. Hitchcock 
 was appointed June 10, 1837, to continue the Miner- 
 alogical and Zoological survey ; and Mr. George B. 
 Emerson, Professors C. Dewev, E. Emmons, Rev. W. 
 B. 0. Peabody, and Drs. T. W. Harris, D. H. Storer 
 and A. A. Gould were commissioned lo take charge 
 of the Botanical and Zoological surveys. The several 
 portions of the work were distributed by agreement 
 among these persons, and the department of insects 
 devolved upon me. Other resolves, authorizing the 
 printing of the several reports, and making appropri- 
 ations for the same were subsequently passed, and 
 the following works by the Commissioners, have been 
 prepared, pr nted, and distributed gratuitously. 

" Final Report on the Geo'ogy of Massachusetts. 
 By Edward Hitchcock, 2 vols, 4to., Amherst, 1841." 

" Reports on the Ichthyology and Herpetology of 
 Massachusetts. By D. H. Storer ; and a Report on 
 t!ie Ornithology of Massachusetts. By W. B. 0. 
 Peabody, 1 vol. 8 vo. Boston, 1839." 

" Report on the Herbaceous Flowering Plants of 
 Massachusetts. By C. Dewey ; — and Report on the 
 Quadrupeds of Massachusetts. By E. Emmons, 1 
 vol., 8 vo. Cambridge, 1840." 

" A Report on the Insects of Massachusetts injuri- 
 ous to vegetation. By T. W. Harris, 1 vol., 8 vo. 
 Cambridge, 1841." 

" Report on the Invertebrata of Massachusetts, com- 
 prising the MoUusca, Crustacea, Annelida, and Ra- 

diata. By A. A. Gould, 1 vol., 8 vo. Cambridge, 
 1841." 

" A Report on the Trees and Shrubs growing nat- 
 urally in the Forests of Massachusetts. By G. B. 
 Emerson, 1 vol., 8 vo. Boston, 1846." 

The Zoological and Botanical Commissioners re- 
 ceived, if I mistake not, about $300 apiece for their 
 services. 

Taking into consideration tha letter of instructions, 
 in which Gov. Everett pointed out, as particularly 
 desired, the economical and agricultural application 
 of our remarks, and upon consultation with Mr. Em- 
 erson, the Chairman of the Commission, I concluded 
 it best to confine my attention in the report principal- 
 ly to the insects injurious to vegetation ; but to meet 
 a general want that had been observed of an introduc- 
 tory work on our insects, I gave some general account 
 of the subject, and arranged the insects treated ac- 
 cording to a scientific classification of them, putting 
 the whole, however, into such plain and familiar lan- 
 guage as to be intelligible, I hoped, to uneducated 
 readers. That the work has, to some extent, served 
 the purpose for which it was designed, may be gath- 
 ered from the fact that the whole edition of 1500 cop- 
 ies (together with an impression of 250 copies extra, 
 printed at my private expense,) has been exhausted, 
 and that a new edition has been called for, and or- 
 dered to be prepared and printed at the public ex- 
 pense. No provision, however, has been made for 
 the execution of figures to accompany the work; and, 
 indeed, our artists are not only unskilled in such kind 
 of illustrations, but their charges are so extravagant 
 as to place these illustrations bej'ond the limits of 
 any reasonable appropriation. 

Having now answered your enquiries in full, I beg 
 to express a hope that the State of Pennsylvania may 
 do something to promote investigations on the interes- 
 ting subject of insect history and insect depredations. 
 There already exists in your State an Entomological 
 Society, consisting of several active members, and 
 skillful naturalists, such as Dr. Melsheimer and Prof. 
 Haldeman, who would be fully competent to under- 
 take a work on the subject of destructive insects. 
 With respect, your most obedient, 

Thaddeus William Harris.
