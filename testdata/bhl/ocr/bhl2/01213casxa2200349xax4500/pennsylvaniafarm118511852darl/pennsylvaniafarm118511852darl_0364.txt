 Shrubs and Trees for Hedges. 

In continuation of my paper on the subject of hedg- 
 es in the October number of the Farm Journal, I 
 would add— The Viburnum pnmifolhcm,or Shcepber- 
 ry tree, I believe might be used with advantage as a 
 hedging shrub or tree ; not often attaining more than 
 15 feet in height and six inches in diameter ; very 
 stiff and unyielding, with the ends of its spurs and 
 branches performing the office of thorns, having sim- 
 ilar properties as a hedge plant, with the buckthorn; 
 and not so entirely occupying the adjoining ground 
 with its very fine fibrous roots ; and beside, being a 
 native shrub remarkably adapted to some localities. 

The Wild Plum Pnimis Americana of Marshall 
 will make an excellent hedge in suitable soil. I 
 planted some stones of the wild plum in my garden 
 to raise stocks for grafting other fruits on. They were 
 grafted at probably two years old, but the grafts did 
 not grow, and each stock sent up several suckers, 
 which were permitted to grow two years ; (1 believe 
 with a view to grafting,) At the end of that time the 
 row was a sufficient hedge of 6 feet or more in height, 
 very stiff and thorny. To what extent this tree would 
 bear trimming I do not know ; but when used as a 
 stock for grafting, even the slow growing varieties of 
 the common plum upon ; the graft usually overgrows 
 the stock. It is a long lived tree, grows slowly, but 
 attains a diameter of a foot or more. 

The English Sloe Pnmus Spinosa would probably 
 be more easily managed as a hedge plant, but would 
 require more time to make an effective hedge as it 
 does not grow so vigorously — Thirty years ago,a hedge 
 of this kind remained on the Bartram Farm near 
 Philadelphia. It had the appearance of having been 
 a good hedge, but had tlien been neglected for some 
 time. 

The Sea buckthorn lUppopliae rhamnoides, is a Eu- 
 ropean shrub or tree, found from Italy to Lapland^ 
 generally near the Sea. It is a hardy, free growing 
 shrub, attaining a height of 1.5 feet or more, stiff and 
 armed with short thorns. It grows well on common 
 soil and I judge, would make a good hedge; but as it 
 naturally grows in wet situations, it is probably the 
 best /Aorny plant for hedging in wet or low grounds. 
 The leaves and young shoots of this (and of the Sliep- 

herdia next described) are of a dull white or silver 
 color ; and therefore, these shrubs may be used with 
 advantage by the skillful landscape gardener where 
 hedges are required in pleasure grounds or ornamen- 
 tal plantations. 

ShepJierdia Arcfcniea or Buffalo berry was first in- 
 troduced by Long's party from the Rocky Mountains, 
 and is described as being abundant there — Nuttall 
 in his continuation of Michaux' Sylva, says that the 
 great use of this plant ■will be for hedges or live fen- 
 ces ; and describes a standard tree in AVinships Nur- 
 sery near Boston, as 20 feet high, and as large as an 
 apple tree. I have seen accounts of hundreds of thou- J 
 sands of seedlings having been sent to Europe,'_but it ' 
 is little known here. It produces fruit at 10 feet high 
 in very great abundance. The fruit 'is of the form, 
 color, and about half the size of a common red cur- 
 rant. As to growth and armature, this tree may rank 
 with the Buckthorn and I judge will be found at least 
 equal for hedging. 

Of the Mesp'dus pyracantli a or evergreen thorn, 1 have 
 seen one hedge, on a bank supported by a low wall, 
 separating an ornamental plantation from the public 
 road. As a hedge I believe it would have been suffi- 
 cient for a farm enclosure without the wall. From 
 observations, made on this plant, which I have culti- 
 vated many years as an ornamental shrub, I be- 
 lieve that with some care in staking and tying upthe 
 branches for two or three years, (not requiring more 
 time than is usually required to trim and head down) 
 s hedge could be made sufficient to turn men, horses 
 and cattle. It is evergreen, or nearly so ; in mild 
 winters retaining its leaves till spring. In John 
 Evans' grounds, in Delaware county, on the 9th of 
 the present month, I saw a plant of this species about 
 12 feet high; variegated with a profusion of red ber- 
 ries, forming, with its brownish green leaves, the 
 most beautiful object in a large collection of rare and 
 beautiful plants. As a shrub it is naturally strag- 
 gling, throwing out long slender branches, nearly 
 horizontally, but is easily kept trained as an upright 
 shrub. This straggling habit may increase its value 
 as a hedge plant, it being armed with short sharp 
 thorns. Alan W. Corson.

 Effect of Frost on Peach Trees, &c. 

Mk. Editor : — Hereabouts the severe frost — (8°@ 
 10°) — has proved destructive to the peach crop. In 
 low situations it is difficult to find a fruit bud that is 
 not black at heart ; a few only, of the smallest, most 
 compact, and ripest buds are yet uninjured. In wet 
 ground, where the sapvessels were replete, the trunks 
 of the trees have in many cases been rent by the in- 
 tense cold. 

Thosh who feel a natural hesitancy about pruning 
 off branches which promise fruit, may take advan- 
 tage even of this disaster, by giving their trees a
