liearty " shortening in" to induce new and vigorous 
 shoots. It should be -well remembered that the 
 peach tree only bears on young -n-ood, and long, na- 
 ked, sun and wind, and time-dried branches, convey 
 sap no better than choked and rotten pipes convey 
 water. Such trees should have the top reduced one 
 half or more, and if healthy sprouts issue near the 
 ground, the tree may renew its youth. If sprouts is- 
 sue from the ground, it becomes difSoult to rid them 
 of worms. On this account there should be but a 
 single shoot stem. 

Of late years our peach trees lose their first leaves 
 every spring ; the leaves become curled and blistered 
 and eventually fall off. Towards midsummer, new 
 leaves issue, and the functions of growth proceed ; 
 but this late growth does not ripen fu.ly, and the trees 
 suffer (in consequence ?) much more from frost than 
 they formerly did. This disease is universal here, 
 affecting, it may be said, every tree, and on that ac- 
 count is perhaps more injurious than even the yellows. 

Will some of your correspondents who are expert 
 in Peach-culture pronounce upon this. All lovers 
 of good peaches, and all who find themselves bene- 
 fitted by their use, (which classes every body, I be- 
 lieve, without exception,) will be advantaged by any 
 information that will lead to a restoration of fruitful- 
 ness and vigor to the peach tree. 

The inner side of the diseased leaves is often cov- 
 ered with aphides. Are they a cause or a conse- 
 quence ? Infusions of tobacco and other applications 
 usually applied to destroy aphide, do not appear to 
 remedy or mitigate the evil. W. G. Waring.

For the Farm Journal. 
 Caterpillars—Black Knot. 

Mk. Editor : — Desirous of information on a sub- 
 ject which interests me much, I know of no way 
 that I can obtain it better than by making a request 
 through the columns of your very valuable Journal. 
 When the great prejudice against " Book Farming" 
 shall be removed, when we find the Journal in the 
 hands of every farmer and its teachings followed, 
 ■when " Agricultural Chemistry" shall be studied and 
 practised, and the "good old way" cast aside, then 
 our farms will assume a different appearance, and 
 our farmers be more amply rewarded for their labor. 

Every summer my fruit trees are covered with 
 millions of caterpillars. I have followed the advice 
 of my neighbors, in endeavoring to destroy them, 
 but hitherto without any good result.. Before the 
 young caterpillars move from their nests in the morn- 
 ing, I have taken the nest and all in my hand, and 
 crushed it. I have tried tow and turpentine, and I 
 have tried blowing them off with a gun ; but in a 
 week after performing these operations, my trees 
 would be full again. It has been three years that 

my trees have thus been affected. The caterpillars 
 completely divest them of their foliage, and I lose 
 my fruit. 

My plum trees also suffered much from what I 
 supposed was the drought of last summer. Every 
 branch is now covered with knots. The only way I 
 know of removing them, is by paring them off smooth- 
 ly and even with the branch, for if I attempt to cut 
 them out altogether, it would be as well for me to cut 
 the tree down at once. But if these knots extend 
 entirely through the branch, which I believe they do, 
 I see no way of preventing that part of the branch 
 from dying — the sap cannot pass through these "tu- 
 mors." I seen in some works on farming, that a long 
 spell of warm weather causes it. I have however, 
 two trees of the same sort of plum, which stand 
 within a few feet of the affected one), and they are 
 perfectly sound. Many of my plums rot on the tree, 
 before they get ripe, and numbers of them fall — they 
 are all planted in good earth. Jlost of them are in 
 my garden, with a fair exposure to the sun, and all 
 of them are young. Now cannot some of your sub- 
 scribers tell us of a remedy for Caterpillars and knots 
 on Plum trees ? Many of them know a remedy, and if 
 they would only communicate it, perhaps it might be 
 of service to many whose trees suffer like mine. 

Much fruit is lost annually by frost. If persons 
 would take the trouble to pack snow around the base 
 and trunk of the tree, they would find it of advantage. 
 It keeps back the blossom, and the tree does not come 
 in bloom until we can fairly count upon no more cold 
 weather. Yours truly, W. D.

[The warts or knots referred to above, are very 
 common to the plum and several varieties of the 
 cherry, and are generally supposed to be produced by 
 the punctures of beetles, and are the residence of 
 their grubs. Dr. Peck says, the seat of the disease is 
 in the bark. The sap is directed from its regular 
 course and is entirely absorbed by the bark, which is 
 very much increased in thickness; the cuticle bursts, 
 the swelling becomes irregular, and is formed into 
 black lumps, with a cracked, uneven and granulated 
 face. One of the best remedies for the black knot, 
 where the disease has not extended itself too widely, 
 is to cut off the limb below the tumor and burn it. — 
 Where this course would involve the destruction of 
 large branches, another remedy may be tried, which 
 is, to cut out the warts until every vestige of granu- 
 lated matter is removed. Then rub the cut part with 
 common salt. However, the most proper and effectual 
 plan is to examine the trees carefully every spring, 
 and so soon as there is any evidence of the black 
 knot, let the branches on which they are found be 
 amputated and burnt. We will offer some methods 
 for the destruction of the caterpillars in our next.—
