Effpcts of the severe cold on Peach Trees. 

Serious apprehensions are entertained in regard to 
 the peach crop for the coming season. We are in- 
 formed from various sources, that nearly all of the 
 buds are frozen. In some few localities we learn that 
 such is not the case, but the exceptions to the general 
 destruction are, we fear, very rare. We have exam- 
 ined a number of buds, every one of which gave un- 
 mistakeable evidence of the destruction of the germ. 
 Any one may satisfy himself of the fact by cutting 
 open a hud, and if the small germ inside be of a black 
 or brown color instead of green, there will be no fruit 
 from that bud, although there may bo a blossom.

To OUR Newspaper exchanges. — We have on sev- 
 eral occasions tendered, through our columns, thanks 
 to our brethren of the newspaper press for the very 
 kind and flattering notices given of the Journal. — 
 They have been of great service to us, and we feel 
 deeply indebted for them, and can but regret that it 
 is not in our power to reciprocate the favor. We 
 trust that we shall not be considered unreasonable, 
 if in addition to the favors already received, we ask 
 that they notice the fact, that with the present num- 
 ber our first volume closes ; and that the liberal en- 
 couragement extended to the Journal during the past 
 year, enables us to assure all who may feel disposed 
 to subscribe, that it is now permanently established, 
 and during the coming year it shall be our endeavor 
 to render it still more worthy of general patronage. 

To old subscribers. 

Frequent inquiries have been made of us recently, 
 whether old subscribers will be permitted to renew 
 their subscriptions at club prices. As a general re- 
 ply to these inquiries, we answer, most assuredly. — 
 Our terms now, are the same as formerly, and we 
 indulge the belief that not only shall we retain our 
 old friends, hut that our club lists ( with large addi- 
 tions of new names) will be renewed. 

To County Societies — An offer. 

We will send a copy of the Farm Journal gratis, 
 to every county or township agricultural or horticul- 
 tural society in the State, the Secretary of which will 
 inform us where the headquarters of the society are 
 and furnish us with a list of the officers. Any in- 
 formation relative to the condition and prospects of 
 the Society will also be very acceptable.
