[Wo take great pleasure io asking the especial at- 
 tention of our readers to the subjoined pedigree of 
 the celebrated durham bull, " Rockland," bred and 
 raised by James Gowen, Esq., of Mount Airy, Phila- 
 delphia countj-. 

His owner, we understand, would have no objec- 
 tion to selling him to some spirited breeder or club 
 of gcntlomiMi, who would use him advantageously, 
 Mr. O. having but a limited stock at present, and 
 having two other young Durham bulls in course of 
 rearing.]

 at the next annual exhibition he was awarded the 
 first premium as the best Durham bull of three years 
 old and upwards, in a class where the competition 
 was both numerous and great. He likewise took the 
 first premium, last October, at the State Agricultural 
 Exhibition, held at Ilarrisburg, as being the best

Advance of Scientific and Practical Agriculture in 
 In Pennsylvania. 

One of the most gratifying tendencies of the pnb- 
 lic measures of the present day is their practical cha- 
 racter. Although speculative theorists are still nu- 
 merous, and impracticable novelties are daily pressed 
 upon the attention of the public, it is evident that 
 they are fast losing ground; while those measures 
 calculated to advance the interests and promote the 
 comfort of society, are gaining a firm loothold with 
 the people generally. 

Science, like book-farming, was for a long time re- 
 garded as adapted to those classes of the community 
 only, whose ample means gave them time for reading 
 and investigation, and whose pursuits were calculated 
 to amuse rather than profit. It was not until the 
 mechanic arts had enlisted the powers of science in 
 their behalf and triumphed over the former seeming- 
 ly insurmountable obstacles that interposed between 
 them and complete success, that the minds of men 
 were directed to the importance of a knowledge of 
 the principles which lie at the foundation of agricul- 
 ture. The efforts of a few strong-hearted, noble 
 souled men, to introduce a system of farming which 
 should be an improvement upon "the good old way," 
 were met with derision. But despite the opposition 
 with which they were called to contend, these brave 
 spirits persevered in the good work, until eventually, 
 they triumphed over the prejudices opposed to them, 
 and now, science and agriculture go hand in hand — 
 twin sisters, dispensing blessings on every side. — ■ 
 "Book farming" is no longer decried as useless and 
 unprofitable ; and those who avail themselves of the 
 practical experience conveyed through the agricultu- 
 ral publications of the day, are no longer regarded 
 as mere theorists. This healthful tone of feeling Ls 
 to be considered as the precursor of a system of farm- 
 ing in Pennsylvania, which cannot but operate pow- 
 erfully upon her future prosperity. With the spread 
 of .scicJitific agricultural intelligence, we may right- 
 fully expect increased crops, with lessened expenses. 
 "Knowledge is power," and the farmer whose mind 
 is most thoroughly trained to familiarity with the 
 principles of agriculture — who understandingly atr 
 tends to the duties of his calling, is c ;rtainly more 
 likely to succeed, than he, who blindly follows the 
 lead of those who have ever stood opposed to the in- 
 troduction of modern improvements. By this we do 
 not desire to be understood as claiming all the merit 
 for scientific theory. Men may theorize, but prac- 
 tice alone can realize. Theory can bo valuable only 
 when reduced to practice ; hence, the man who com- 
 bines the scientific with the practical, is the man who 
 will eventually succeed best. Let the friends, there- 
 fore, of our State and national prosperity, not forget 
 the duties resting upon them. If applied agricultu- 
 ral science is calculated to advance the interests of, 
 the farmer, then the duty of every friend of the
