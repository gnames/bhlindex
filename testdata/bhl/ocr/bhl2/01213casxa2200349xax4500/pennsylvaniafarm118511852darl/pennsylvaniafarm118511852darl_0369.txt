farmer is, to lend his influence to such means as are 
 calculated to spread broadcast throughout our State 
 and the Union, a knowledge of those branches of 
 science which stand most intimately allied to success- 
 ful husbandry. These means are various; but none 
 appear to us so completely within the reach of all, as 
 agricultural periodicals. Embracing, as all good 
 publications of this class should, something upon 
 every department of farming ; and combining in a 
 small space the practical experiments of hundreds 
 of excellent farmers ; they become to the observing 
 husbandman, a source, not Only of deep pleasure, but 
 of large profit. Not that all the suggestions contain- 
 ed in them are to be adopted ; or even a majority of, 
 them ; but we cannot think that any attentive reader 
 of the Farm Journal during the past year, can have 
 failed to realize more than ten-fold the amount of 
 his subscription, unless he was wilfully determined 
 to disregard the many valuable truths, which have 
 from time to time been presented through its columns. 
 And the same may be safely said of other Journals 
 of a similar character. Honestly believing this, we 
 ask for it, increased support, and hope that those who 
 have derived benefit from its perusal, will assist us 
 in our efforts to spread still wider its good influences. 

Protection by law to Fruits and Fruit Trees. 

A bill is now pending before the Legislature which 
 provides for the better protection of fruits and fruit 
 trees, and we earnestly hope it may become a law. 
 There is no class of the community so subject to in- 
 roads and depredations upon their premises as the 
 farmer and fruit grower. Orchards have come to be 
 regarded as public property ; and the owner who 
 undertakes to protect them against depredators is 
 set down as mean and churli.sh. To our mind it is 
 perfectly clear, that the trees and fruit in the farm- 
 er's orchard are as much his property as the goods 
 and silver of the merchant; and as such, as fully en- 
 titled to the protection of the law. But, by one of 
 those strange inconsistencies which sometimes cha- 
 racterize law-making, a farmer's orchard may be 
 plundered almost with impunity, while the theft of a 
 single penny from the till of the merchant, subjects 
 the ofiender to imprisonment. For the sake of justice 
 therefore, to a class of the community, who ask but 
 little from our legislators in behalf of themselves, 
 we hope this bill may pass. 

In the vicinity of many large towns, the cultivation 
 of fruit has been almost wholly abandoned. Those 
 who for years attempted it, have given up in despair, 
 their trees being broken down from year to year, and 
 the fruit carried away by idle persons. The law 
 which protects the fruit thief, gives direct encourage- 
 ment to theft of all kinds. The man who will clan- 
 destinely rob a neighbor's fruit tree, we should be 
 very loath to trust within reach of our purse, for we 
 cannot conceive the theft of money, a crime of any 
 greatÂ«r magnitude than that of fruit. 

National Agricultural Bureau. 

At the last quarterly meeting of the Maryland 
 State Agricultural Society, the following resolution 
 in relation to the establishment of an Agricultural 
 Bureau at Washington was adopted : 

Whereas, the President of the United States in his 
 last annual message called the attention of Congress 
 to the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau at the 
 city of Washington. Be it therefore 

JiCfiohvil, That the thanks of this Society be, and 
 they are hereby tendered to his Excellency, the Pre- 
 sident, for the interest which he has not only on the 
 pi-esent, but on other occasions manifested in behalf 
 of American husbandry. And be it further 

Resolved, That this Society, regarding as it does, 
 the paramount value of such an institution, at the 
 seat of government, established upon liberal princi- 
 ples, to the success of an improved system of Agri- 
 culture in this country, a committee of be now 

appointed to proceed to Washington in order to pro- 
 mote the establishment of said institution by using 
 such efforts as may seem most appropriate in their 
 judgments, as well as to press the subject respectful- 
 ly upon the immediate attention of our Senators and 
 Representatives in Congress, urging them to use their 
 best efforts towards bringing up the matter for the 
 consideration of their respective houses, at as early 
 a day as practicable. 

It will be remembered, that resolutions similar in 
 substance were passed at the annual meeting of the 
 Pennsylvania State Agricultural Societj'. The sub- 
 ject is one of vital importance to the interests of 
 agriculture in the United States, and demands the 
 earnest attention of Congress. A Department of 
 Agriculture exists in France and other nations, and 
 the most beneficial results have flowed from it. Why 
 should not the same results follow in our countrj' ? 
 Agriculture is our leading interest. Three-fifths of our 
 population are engaged in it, and all are dependent 
 upon it for the necessaries of life. A National Agri- 
 cultural Department at Washington, established upon 
 such principles as would bring to its support the in- 
 fluence of all the State and County Societies, could 
 not fail to give an impetus to the farming interest 
 which would be felt in every section of our great 
 country, and would do much to promote our national 
 strength and greatness. We shall take up this sub- 
 ject again when we have more space and time than 
 now. 

We observe also, that the Maryland Society highly 
 approves of the plan proposed by the Pennsylvania 
 Society, for the formation of a National Agricultural 
 Society. The President has been authorized to ap- 
 point a delegate from each Congressional district to 
 represent Maryland in the Convention. We hope 
 that other State Societies will follow up the good 
 work and appoint delegates. Such a convention, re- 
 presenting fully the agricultural interests of the ^ a- 
 rious States, would exert a vast influence in securing 
 the passage of a law establishing a Department of 
 Agriculture at Washington.
