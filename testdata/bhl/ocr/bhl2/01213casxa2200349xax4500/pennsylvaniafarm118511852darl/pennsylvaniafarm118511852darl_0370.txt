Complimentary Resolution. 

IS with feelings of deep gratification that we 
 give pLace to the following highly complimentary res- 
 olution, passed by the State Agricultural Society, at 
 its last annual meeting. To find our humble efforts 
 to build up a character for the Farm Journal endor- 
 sed by such high authority, is to us, a powerful in- 
 centive to future exertion. During the year which 
 closes with the present number, we have labored "in 
 season and out of season" to present such matter to 
 our readers, as we supposed best adapted to their 
 tastes, and calculated to promote their interest. We 
 dare not flatter ourselves that we have given univer- 
 sal satisfac*^ion, but we can with pleasure refer to the 
 high testimonial of favor at the hands of the State 
 Society, and might, if we had room, furnish hundreds 
 of individual testimonials equally flattering If our 
 efforts to please have thus far been successful, may we 
 not hope that with the coming year, our claim upon 
 the favor of our subscribers will be increased. We 
 think so ; and therefore only ask that those who 
 think approvingly of what we have done, will aid us 
 by their contributions of facts and subscriptions to do 
 still better for the future. 

It was resolved by the Executive Committee, that 
 we deem the estahlishmeiit and success of an Agricultu- 
 ral Journal published in Pennsijlvania, as essential to 
 the proper exposition of the principles of agriculture 
 as practised in this State ; and that we approve of 
 THE Pennsylvania Farm Journal, published at the 
 city of Lancaster, by A. M. Spangler, and edited by 
 S. S. Haldeman. 

retaries of the different Societies, in order that we 
 may bo enabled to report to our readers, the progress 
 agriculture is making throughout the State generally. 

To our Philadelphia subscribers. 

At the solicitation of quite a large number of our 
 city subscribers, we have made arrangements with 
 W. B. ZiEEER, South Third street, for the regular de- 
 livery of the Farm Journal for the coming year. By 
 this arrangement we hope to obviate the difficulties 
 which have heretofore stood in the way of the regular 
 receipt of the Journal by our city subscribers. Not- 
 withstanding every precaution on our part during 
 the past year, frequent complaints have reached us, 
 and as we desire to please all, we have arranged as 
 above. Should any of our subscribers prefer having 
 them by mail, and will notify us of their desire, we 
 will continue to send them as heretofore. 

State Agricultural Fair. — The nest State 
 Fair.— At the last meeting of the Executive Commits 
 tee, on Thursday, Feb. 6th, it was resolved that the 
 next State Agricultural Exhibition should be held on 
 the 20th, 21st and 22d of October. A committee 
 consisting of the Hon. Fred'k Watts, James Gowen 
 and David Mumma, to receive proposals from the dif- 
 ferent towns desirous of competing for the fair. All 
 proposals must be addressed to Hon. F. Watts, Car- 
 lisle, Pa. 

We observe that the New York State Fair will be 
 held at Dtica, on the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th of Sep- 
 tember. The list of premiums having already been 
 published. 

Liberal Subscription.— The citizens of Lancaster 
 city have raised, by subscription, twenty-five hundred 
 dollars, to secure the holding of the next State Agri- 
 cultural Fair at that city. This amount can be 
 largely increased, if necessary. 

Increase of County Societies. 

The past year has been a proud one to the friends 
 of agriculture in Pennsylvania. On every side, we 
 behold the rich fruits of the labors of those who were 
 instrumental in securing the organization and incor- 
 poration of the State Society. In almost every coun- 
 ty of the Commonwealth an auxiliary Society has 
 been formed, and we are pleased to observe that 
 amongst those who have taken hold of them, are men 

who wers never known to falter in a good cause. 

Wo trust the work will not end here. Next fall will 
 tell the tale. We shall be glad to hear from the Sec- 

CUMBERLAND NURSERIES. 

THE proprietor of the above establishment, in calling the atten- 
 tion of the public to his present stock of Fruit and Ornamental 
 Trees, Shrubs, Plants, Vines, &c., would call especial attention to 
 his extensive stock of well grown and beautiful Apple Trees, em- 
 bracing a complete collection, collected from several hundred va- 
 rieties under culture at these Nurseries, and such only reserved fur 
 general cultivation, as have proven by actual test to be worthy a 
 place 111 the prudent man's orchard ; yet for the curious, or those 
 who wish to test for themselves, he is prepared to supply in mod- 
 erate quantities, nenrly every variety enumerated in the catalogue. 

In addition to the above, he has also a few hundred thousand 
 eitra large and fine Sweet Apple Trees, eight to twelve inches 
 high, (for stock feeding,) which he will sell at from 875 to 885 per 
 thousand, at the Nurseries, and no further charges lor packing, 
 simply to cover cost. These last are offered so unusually low on 
 account of his wishing to clear a few acres of his ground this 
 spring. All the above articles will be disposed of on the most lib- 
 eral terms. 

&"A11 orders, post-paid, enclosing the cash, or a satisfactory 
 reference, will be punctually attended to, and all trees carefully 
 labelled, packed, and forwarded to wherever ordered
