Your weak swarms'that have not honey enough to 
 pass the Winter, must be fed, or joined with other 
 lamilies. Feed them in any manner you please to 
 effect the end desired. If your families are all rath- 
 er short of honey, you had better feed all at once. 
 This is effected by a trough, or box made tight, say 
 18 inches long, by 6 wide, and 4 deep. The hunoy 
 or syrup of sugar, is poured into this trough, and cov- 
 ered with a float, or light board filled with small 
 holes, or sawed through from end to end as many 
 times as can be, with the interstices cut out on a bev- 
 el with a knife, to admit the honey to pass up. West 
 India honey is the only article to feed, unless you 
 use brown sugar. This honey is worth 75 cents per 

fallen, and weighs about 12 pounds to the gallon, 
 t is kept in all large towns. Half honey and half 
 sugar make a good feed. Any cheap dry sugar will 
 do. Put your honey and sugar into a put, or kettle, 
 with a quart of water to about seven pounds of su- 
 gar, and heat to a boiling point, skim, and it is ready 
 tor use. Do the same if the sugar is used without 
 honey. 

If you cannot get honey easily, you should feed 
 lightly on sugar alone, as the water is likely to evap- 
 orate in the cells, after a while, and the sugar to har- 
 den in them, consequently feeding syrup of sugar in 
 the spring is much more desirable than in the fall. 

If you have large sheets of empty combs, you can 
 feed very well by warming your feed, and turning it 
 from a pitcher upon the comb till the cells are filled. 

When honey is fed alone, or with sugar, there is 
 danger of setting all your bees to robbing; hence, be- 
 fore you feed, you must contract the entrances to your 
 hive so as two or three bees can pass at a time; and 
 if the families are weak, so that but one can pass. 
 You should contract the entrances, however, in Sep- 
 tember, whether you feed or not, to prevent robbing, 
 but not too close. 

As feeding should generally be done in October, 
 those who have not done it should lose no time. Take 
 the first warm, pleasant days, and feed as much as 
 »you can, in the shortest time, so as not to disturb the 
 bees any longer than is necessary. You can feed 
 them from the chambers, or under particular hives if 
 you please, and leave such as have honey enough unfed. 
 Feeding under the bees is done by raising the hive up- 
 on a bos to fit its size. Then place the feed on the 
 stand, within the box, it being open at top and bot- 
 tom. 

Joining two weak families is a good plan, when 
 one hive has honey enough to winter on. The addi- 
 tion of another family will not reduce its stores one 
 jot, strange, as it may appear, as bees consume less 
 than half the feed vrhen in large numbers that they 
 do in small numbers, having to consume more food to 
 keep up vitality. 

The manner of joining is as follows : — About the 
 first of December, or as soon as it is obvious that the 
 bees will not leave their hives much, take the most 
 nnmerous family and place it over the weaker one at 
 evening, the latter being turned bottom up. Then by 
 rapping the lower hive with a rod the bees will ascend 
 and join those in the upper hive, and if they refuse 
 to leave rapidly, a little smoke applied below to pass 
 through tbem, will give them a start. 

Dry cellars will answer to winter bees in, and any 
 darh, airy upper room, but an otiter box to cover over 
 a hive, with the passage cut to correspond with the 
 passage in the hive proper, is the best protection we 
 kuow of. Or you may take hay or straw and sur- 
 round your hives so that the bees may be well ventila- 

ted, leaving their entrances open and the hives raised 
 a little from the floor boards,then darken the passages 
 with anything before them, so that the light shall not 
 enter arid attract the bees but in mild, sunny weath- 
 er, and you can winter your bees in perfect safety. —

Princess Alice Maud Strawberry. 

We extract lielow from the reports of the Ameri- 
 can Pomological Society, some account of this Straw- 
 berry, which would appear to be well worthy of at- 
 tention. Prom some cause the merits of this fruit, 
 have we think been overlooked. In Downing's and 
 Thomas' Fruit Books, we cannot find it mentioned, 
 and in Barry, "that it is a very large and handsome 
 English variety, very productive, but of indifferent 
 flavor." We have fruited it for two or three years, 
 and find it of very large size, and the flavor eery (/oorf. 
 The flesh is rather firm, and it has always seemed to 
 us, one of our very desirable kinds, for general cultiva- 
 tion, and have not been able to understand, why it is 
 not more known. An enthusiastic Strawberry grow- 
 er in Delaware, appreciates it as we do, and has had 
 the like success. It is probable that as with the 
 "Black Prince," soil and climate affect its quality. 
 It ripens in Virginia eight days before Ilovey's seed- 
 ling. We think it much before this latter in respect 
 to flavor, and hope it may have further trial.

Mr. John Seater, — At a Meeting of the Commit- 
 tee of the Pomological Congress held yesterday, I 
 was directed by them to request of you any facts 
 with regard to your Alice Maud Strawberry, that it 
 may be convenient for vou to furnish. You will please 
 to mention the time it was imported, and where from 
 — your general success in cultivation — how many 
 days in advance of Hovey's Seedlingit is generally, 
 in the same soil and exposure — what is the difference 
 in size of your best specimens of each — how many 
 berries to the quart from your best crops — what has 
 been the best yield to any given quantity of ground — 
 how have your plants stood the climate — how attect- 
 ed by the hot sun of summer and the severe frost of 
 winter? To this you will add your method of culti 
 vation. Yours, truly, 

JOSHUA PIERCE. 

Mr. Joshua Pierce: — 

Dear sir, — Your note was duly 
 received. In answer to your inquiries concerning 
 my Alice Maud Strawberry — first, you wished me to 
 mention its faults. I answer, none to my knowledge. 
 2d. When imported, and who from ? Mr. William 
 Barrat, of Wakefield, Yorkshire, England, in the fall 
 of '45 and spring of '46. 3d. How many days it ripens 
 earlier than Hovey's Seedling, on the same soil and 
 exposure? On an average of eight d.ays. 4th. My 
 success in cultivation ? I have missed no crop since 
 I commenced cultivating it; I believe it to be a surer 
 crop than any variety I am acquainted with. 5th. 
 The difterence in size ? I cannot say I am satisfied ; 
 for size and quantity Alice will beat Ilovey's Seedling 
 or any other variety I have seen,two to one. Note,I do 
 not sav but that a few fruit might be picked out of 
 Hovey's Seedling as large as Alice Maud; I speak of 
 the crop in general. Olh. Given quantity ? 1 do not
