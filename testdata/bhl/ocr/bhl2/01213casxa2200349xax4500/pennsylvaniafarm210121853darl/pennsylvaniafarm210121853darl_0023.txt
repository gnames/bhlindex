The ewes hero ropresonteJ, weigh in ftxir condition 
 about 125 pounds e;ioli. Tlio average live weight of 
 our whole floclc of ewes, of this breed, after having 
 been shorn, did not much exceed 100 pounds. The 
 average weight of fleece, in the dirt, after a long sea 
 voyage, was 12J pounds. In selecting the ewes, I 
 regarded a large size of secondary consideration, pre- 
 ferring those that would yield the most fine wool in 
 proportion to the cost of keeping. 

It is believed by many who are unacquainted with 
 the French sheep, that they require more than ordi- 
 nary feed and attention to keep them in good condi- 
 tion ; but my experience with them thus far, leads 
 mo to the conclusion that they will thrive well on or- 
 dinary keeping. They require nothing more than a 
 good pasture during the summer season. I gave 
 mine nothing more the past season, neither do I in- 
 tend to the present. They are well adapted to our 
 climate, and will bear exposure to storms equally well 
 with any sheep in t e country. A portion of our 
 flock were turned oflf to pasture after shearing, and 
 came up to their winter quarters looking remarkably 
 well ; having had no shelter from the storms during 
 the summer. I should be unwilling to say that I be- 
 lieved the French sheep greatly superior to all other 

breeds in every respect, but believe that all experien- 
 ced and impartial judges will admit that they possess 
 the following desirable points, viz ; 

1. A good vigorous constitution. 

2. They carry a heavy fleece of wool, of a fair 
 grade of fineness. 

3. They are gentle and docile in their disposition, 
 and fatten easy. 

The above qualities I believe are better combined 
 in these sheep than in any others ; but where wool 
 alone is the object, I am of the opinion that there are 
 other varieties of the Merinos of a less size, which 
 will yield as much or more wool in proportion to their 
 size and cost of keeping, than those under considera- 
 tion. Some few improved flocks of the old Spanish 
 stock, will perhaps compare favorably with them for 
 the profitable production of wool ; but the variety to 
 which 1 have more particular reference, are known 
 as the Silesian Merinos, of which I send you a cut 
 and will send you a description for some future num- 
 ber of TuE Plow. I have washed our French sheep 
 this year, and after shearing, will send you the re- 
 sult. — The Plow. Geo. Cambbell,

Cheap Wash for Cottages of Wood. 

For the outside of wooden cottages, barns, out 
 buildings,_fences, &c., where economy is important, 
 the following wash is recommended : — 

Take a clean barrel that will hold water. Put in 
 it half a bushel of fresh quick-lime, and slake it by 
 p'^iuring over it boiling water sufficient to cover it 4 
 or 5 inches deep, and stirring it till slacked. 

When quite slacked, dissolve in water and add 2 
 lbs. sulphate of zinc, (white vitriol,) which may bo 
 had at any of the druggists, and which, in a few 
 weeks will cause the whitewash to harden on the 
 wood-work. Add sufficient water to bring it to the 
 consistency of thick whitewash. This wash is of 
 course white, and as white is a color which we think 
 should never be used, except upon buildings a good 
 deal surrounded by trees, so as to prevent its glare, 

we would make it a fawn or drab color before using 
 it. 

To make the above wash a pleasing cream color, 
 add 4 lbs. yellow ochre. 

For fawn color, take 4 lbs. umber, 1 lb. Indian red, 
 and 1 lb. lampblack. 

To make the wash gray or stone color, add 4 lbs. 
 raw umber and 2 lbs. lampblack. 

The color may be put on with a common white- 
 wash brush, and will be found much more durable 
 than common whitewash, as the sulphate of zinc sots 
 or hardens the whitewash. — N. E. Cullivalor. 

TViNTER Feeding. — Stock when fed during winter in 
 well protected stable-sheds, etc., will consume one- 
 fourth less food than when exposed to the inclemen- 
 cy of the weather.
