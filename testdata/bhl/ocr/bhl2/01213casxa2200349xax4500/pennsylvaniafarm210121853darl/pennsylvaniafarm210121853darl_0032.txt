In the centre of this circle, and near the centre of th« 
 Square, is a Magnolia Acummala, a magnificent and tall 
 growing tree, and one of the noblest of our native forest; 
 Dg wide-spreading, horizontal branches. At right an. 
 gles from it, and at equal distances, along the outer edge 
 of the circle, are our native B.ilm of Gilead and American 
 Judas Tree, eight of them, planted alternately. In each of 
 tho four smaller circles, marked 16, is Abies Excelsa, "Nor- 
 ay Spruce Fir." The whole occupying 5i acres. 

PubUc Sqtiare at West Chester, Pa. 

With the view of inducing others of our inland 
 towns, to take early measures to appropriate a few 
 acres for the purposes of a public square, we embrace 
 the opportunity to inform our readers, not what may 
 be done, or what ought to be done, but what has been 
 donein West Chester. Marshall Square, containing 5 J 
 acres, and laying on the north eastern section of the 
 borough, was more than four years ago, appropriated 
 by the borough authorities to the purposes of a Pub- 
 lic Square, by the name of Marshall Square, in com- 
 memoration of the "exemplary character and scien- 
 tific labors of Humphrey Marshall, whose botani* 
 garden and residence was a few miles west of the 
 borough. The design in the annexed engraving was 
 arranged at the suggestion of, and the accompanying 
 list of trees and shrubs, selected by three of our most 
 eminent botanists, all residing at this place, Dr. Wm. 
 Darlington, David Townsend and Joshua Hoopcs. 
 They were furnished from the extensive nursery 
 grounds of Paschall Morris 4 Co., of West Chester, 
 and the planting also attended to by them. They 
 are all now growing, and many of them of consider- 
 able size, and it is b«lieved furnish the largest, and 
 best collection of choice trees and shrubs, for public 
 pleasure grounds, in the State out of Philadelphia.* 
 The taste for ornamental planting, public and pri- 
 vate parks, and arboretums is decidedly on the in- 
 crease. Rail Road lines completed, and others pro- 
 jecting, will soon traverse every portion of tho State. 
 New towns and villages are springing up out of the 
 native forests, and while land is comparatively cheap, 
 .ind every corner is yet unoccupied with the remorse- 
 less demands of trade and commerce, we should hope 
 the appropriation of a space for a public square, in 
 all our new, and many of our old settled towns, mtiy 
 not be forgotten. We should be willing, indeed that 
 no act of incorporation for a new town or borough, 
 should be granted by our Legislature without a provi- 
 sion requiring something of this kind. Future gen- 
 erations, at least, would thank them for it, in the in- 
 creased health, comforts, and attractions, which invari- 
 ably accompany these "lungs or breathing places" of 
 densely populated towns and cities. Tho wiso fore- 
 sight of the Founder of Philadelphia in reserving
