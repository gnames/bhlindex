Hawley Apple, Canada Red and Northern Spy. 

Discussions at Pomological Congress. 

Watts, of Rochester, N. Y. I would proprose the 

Ilawley Apple.for trial, and call on Mr.Barry for his 

York. It is very highly es- 
 teemed, and I think worthy to be placed on the list 
 for trial. It is productive, the tree is a good grower, 
 and the quality is very good,though perhaps not firsts 
 rate. 

Mr. HovEV, of Massachusetts. From the speci- 
 mens I have seen, I should class it among the very 
 best apples we hi.ve. It is tender and refreshing, 
 with an agreeable mixture of acid and sweet. 

Col. Hodge, of New York. I think very well of 
 this apple, and have never heard any thing disparag- 
 ing said in relation to it, 

Mr. Hooker, of New York. I have known it for 
 some years, and there is but one opinion expressed in 
 our vicinity, with regard to it. It is considered first- 
 rate. 

Mr. J. J. Thomas, of New York. I ha"e known 
 this apple a great many years, growing on old and 
 young trees, on light anil heavy soils, and the fruit is 
 uniformly good and fair. 

The vote being taken on Mr. Watts' motion, it was 
 decided that the Hawley apple be admitted inthe list 
 of those promising well. 

Mr. Watts, of Rochester,N. Y. I propose the Can- 
 ada Red, which is the Massachusetts Nonsuch, for 
 general cultivation. 

Mr. J. J. TnoMAS, of New York. It has been 
 widely cultivated, and I think it almost worthy of it. 
 It has proved good in Ohio, and in New York, but 
 whether or not far south I am unable to say. 

Mr. WaTTS, of Rochester N. Y. At Rochester it 
 is considered one of our best Western growing ap- 
 ples, and is paticularly fine as a desert fruit. (Mr. 
 Watts here presented a painting of the apple beauti- 
 fully colored.) 

Mr. Robert Parsons, of Long Island. On Long 
 Island, we think it is one of the best we have. 

Mr. Barry, of New York. It lias been tried a 
 long while and is an excellent apple. 

Mr. Walker, of Massachusetts. All I have heard 
 has been favorable to it. It is very excellent; but o- 
 verbears itself. 

Mr. GooDALE, of Maine. It is well known in our 
 markets, and is almost uniformly spotted, and is the 
 last Iruit vie should want there. 

Mr. Downing, of New York. I am to d that this 
 is the case through the State of Connecticut. 

Mr. Hooker, of NewYork. In Western New York 
 three-fourths of the crop have been worthless, but 
 under good cultivation it is excellent. 

The motion was amepded so as to read that it be 
 recommended for general cultivation, in certain lo- 
 calities, and then unanimously adopted. 

Mr. Saul, of New York. I would suggest the 
 Northern Spy as worthy of trial. 

Col Hodge, of New York. There is but one opin- 
 ion in regard to that apple with us. We consider it 
 tine of the very best winter varieties. It has been said 
 to be spotted, but with us it is not so. I esteem it so 
 highly that for two or three years, I have been plant- 
 ing out large orchards of it. 

Mr. Miller. It has been fruited in Pennsylvania, 
 and has become knurlcy. 

Mr. Walker, of Massachusetts- It has not proved 
 in the neighborhood of Boston what we expected of 
 it. When I first saw it I thought it the best apple I 
 tad ever eaten, but now I think it suited only to cer- 

tain localities. I hold it in the highest estimation, 
 but think it wants the warm generous soil ot West- 
 ern New York. 

Mr. GooDALB, of Maine. My father has it, and it 
 is pretty fair. 

Dr. Jones, of Ohio. It has with us all the reput.v 
 tion given it in regard to quality, though it is not so 
 great a bearer as I supposed it to be. 

Mr. Watts, of Rochester, N. Y. One day previ 
 ous to my coming from home, I went ten miles from 
 Rochester, where there were twenty-three trees grow- 
 ing. I found the trees full of fruit about half-grown. 
 It generally bears well, and is a thrifty grower. — 
 Those that do not grow on the ends of the limbs of 
 the tree, or where the sun cannot get at them, are of- 
 ten inferior. About Rochester they are commencing 
 to cultivate it very extensively, and orchards in the 
 vicinity of Lockport, have been all grafted with this 
 fruit. They have been known ten or fifteen ye.ars 
 with us, and the price faimers receive in market for 
 them, is two dollars and a half per bushel — and they 
 will sell sometimes for five dollans — in the spring 
 some sent to New York, brought nine dollars. The 
 reputation in Western New York is high, and if the 
 gentlemen saw it growing they would be perfectly 
 satisfied with it. 
 It was voted that it be recommended for general cul- 
 tivation in certain localities.
