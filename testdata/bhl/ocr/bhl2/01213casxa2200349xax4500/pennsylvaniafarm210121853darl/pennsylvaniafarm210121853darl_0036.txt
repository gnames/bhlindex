to be quite hardy in Pennsylvania; and the elegance 
 of its foliage and fruit render it a very desirable or- 
 nament for country rosider.ces. The beautiful gloss 
 of the leaves is not exceeded by any otlier plant with- 
 in my knowledge. It exhibits its fruit, which is near 
 the size of a pea, in a red dress for a few weeks ; 
 during this time it is quite showy; it then changes to 
 a beautiful glossy black, presenting a very rich ap- 
 pearance, which it frequently retains until late in the 
 ■winter. Sometimes a flock of robins will attack the 
 fruit late in the autumn, and devour it in a day or 
 two. In the autumn of 1851, the fruit of the tree a' 
 hove represented was quickly eaten by those birds. 
 I counted forty at one time thus engaged, and con- 
 cluded their taste differed much from my own, as to 
 my palate it is very nauseous. This tree grows from 
 15 to 30 feet high, and in favorable soil and climate 
 somewhat larger. I obtained the above fourteen or 
 fifteen years ago, at Bartram's Garden, on the Schuyl- 
 kill near Philadelphia; it is now about fifteen feet 
 high. 

I have another species, the Rhamnus Catharticus, 
 which, though less beautiful, is much esteemed north 
 and east of us for making hedges. It is also medici" 
 i.al, and is used in the arts.

[The annexed engraving is from a daguerreotype, 
 which we had taken, with tho view of bringing a very 
 beautiful tree more into notice. We have often ad- 
 mired it, standing in the arboretum of our friend 
 Joshua Hoopes, with its branches bending with the 
 weight of fruit. This arl)oretum, by the way, is well 
 worth visiting, and contains in little more than half 
 an acre, nearly 200 varieties of trees and shrubs, 
 which have been collected by him and planted within 
 the last twenty years. Many of them are rare here, 
 and the collection is one of much interest to the 
 Botanist.] 

Cure for Ros . -Bugs. 

A subscriber wishes to know if any one can sug- 
 gest a method of preventing the yearly incursions of 
 the rose-bug, and having heard eonsiderabe com- 
 plaint among our neighbors at having their cucum- 
 bers, grapes and other fruit d'^stroyed by these insects, 
 I will suggest a remedy. — Plant in the centre of your 
 garden a few damask rose-bushes, and they will never 
 light on anything else. We have a large garden with 
 almost every kind of fruit, vines, shrubbery and flow- 
 ers, with several kinds of roses, and in tho centre we 
 have four bunches of damask rose-bushes, and I nev- 
 er saw in the whole garden a rose-bug on anything 
 but the damask rose. When they are in blossom, I 
 go into the garden once a day with a p.an of hot water, 
 and shake the bugs from these roses into the water, 
 and get about a pint at onetime; this I practice for 
 a few days, and then they will disappear. — [^Boston

Keeping Apples. 

Mr. Pell, of Ulster county, the celebrated exporter 
 of apples to Europe, recommends that apples, after 

having been carefully hand picked in baskets, should 
 be laid on a fioor, by hand, without pouring from the 
 baskets, until they are fifteen to eighteen inches deep, 
 and left to dry and season three weeks ; when again 
 carefully packed in clean barrels, they may be kept, 
 without rotting, any reasonable length of time, and 
 safrly sent to any part of Europe or the East Indies. 
 The plan of drying and seasoning in the air, before 
 barreling, prevailed generally some years ago, al- 
 though, now-a-days, it is mostly discontinued, and 
 thouglit useless. We are disposed to think well of 
 this process when it becomes important to keep ap- 
 ples safely till next spring to send to foreign countries, 
 for we have always observed that on opening a barrel 
 a few days after being put up. in ever so dry weather, 
 that the moisture often stands in drops over whole 
 surfaces, and although loose barrels will allow it 
 mostly to ev.aporate, yet where they come in contact 
 the two surfaces retain it and cause rot. 

The carrying of apples in a common wagon, either 
 before or after barreling,i3 injurious — they should be 
 moved on springs or sleds, the least abrasion of the 
 skin, or crushing of the cell of the pulp containing 
 the juice, allows fermentation and decomposition, and 
 the consequent decay of the whole mass. 

Apples will not freeze until at a temperature of 
 from 5 to 10 degrees below the freezing point of wa- 
 ter, and it is beneficial to keep them as cool as possi- 
 ble, even down to 30 degrees. Apples inclosed in a 
 water-tight cask, may be left in a cold loft all winter 
 without further care, and will be sound in the spring 
 and perfectly fresh. — [Genesee Farmer. 

State Herd Biak. 

With the view of facilitating the formation of a 
 State Herd Book, a? suggested by one of the stock 
 committees at the late Fair, and to accommodate 
 Farmers and Breeders, we are willing to devote a 
 page of the Farm Journal, at the close of the read- 
 ing matter in each number, to registering Pedigrees 
 at the price of 50 cents each. 

Every number of the Journal will hereafter con- 
 tain its own index, so that they can be readily re- 
 ferred to, at each separate issue, and when the vol. 
 is closed, an index of stock will also accompany. As 
 our Journal will from time to time be illustrated with 
 portraits of the best animals of the State, the whole 
 will we think, when bound up, make just such a 
 Herd Book as is wanted, and probably much cheap- 
 er, and quite as complete as any plan that can be 
 proposed. If the owners of fine animals approve 
 this plan, and send us their pedigrees, wo shall com- 
 mence the publication in our next number. The 
 sooner it is commenced the better. At first, we may 
 find it necessary to make up .in extra sheet of a few 
 pages, but after being once fairly posted up, a page 
 or two of the Journal monthly, we think will be suf. 
 fioient. In England, we understand that a Herd 
 Book for Devons' has also been published. 

Subscribers to Farm Journal in Philadelphia, in 
 addition to W. B. Zieber, South 3rd St., can be sup-

 gers' Seed Store, 29 Market st., who will also receive 
 subscriptions.
