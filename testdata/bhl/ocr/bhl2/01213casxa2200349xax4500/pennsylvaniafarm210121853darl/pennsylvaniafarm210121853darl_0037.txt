Pennsvlvakia Hokticultural Society. — The pro- 
 ceedings of the Pennsjlvania Horticultural Society 
 ■were received just as we were locking up the form 
 for the press. We had withheld space till the very 
 latest moment, but owing to their length and the late 
 hour at which they were received, we are compelled 
 to defer their publication until our next number. 

We call attention to the advertisement of Adrian 
 Cornell, of pure Suffolk pigs. This is a valuable 
 breed, of good form, and very easy feeding. The 
 stock of A. Cornell has been obtained from the best 
 sources, and we are assured is well worthy of atten- 
 tion of those wishing to improve their breeds-

 Moctua Agrotl9 Clandestiua, Cut-worm. 

This insect belongs to an old family {Nociuidce.) of 
 nocturnal Lepidoptera or night-flying moths; but 
 more recently, it and a number of others of similar 
 character, habits and appearance, have been group 
 ed together and named Agrotidians {AgroUdidce) or 
 rustic dart moths : perhaps, from being found prin 
 cipally in the fields, and some of them manifesting a 
 darting motion in their flight. I am persuaded the 
 moth is very little known as being identified with the 
 larva or caterpillar which produces it, and whose 
 history and extermination is the chief concern of the 
 agriculturalist and the vegetable grower. The larva 
 is better known as the "cut-worm" so destructive to 
 all young succulent plants, and the very terror of the 
 kitchen gardener. The illustration at the head of 
 this article represents the moth of the corn cut- 
 worm. It does not confine itself to any particular 
 vegetable however, all that are succulent being alike 
 relished by this indiscriminate devourer; but if left 
 to its own choice, it seems to prefer the young corn 
 when it is only a few inches high. 

They sometimes make their appearance in great 
 numbers and at rather irregular periods, and togeth- 
 er with others belonging to the same group, commit 
 great ravages to the young corn, beans, cabbages, ite. 
 They usually bury themselves in the soil three or 
 four inches from the root of the plant during the 
 day, and come up at night, or in cloudy days, and 
 cut the tender vegetables off near the surface of the 
 soil, and after having devoured a portion, if not all of 
 it, they return again to their former hiding place as 

soon as daylight or the sun appears. It is said, that 
 in sixty bushels of mould taken from a field where 
 the larva of several species (allied to the one we are 
 considering) prevailed, there were twenty-three bush- 
 els of the caterpillars.* 

It appears that when first disclosed from the egg, 
 they subsist on the various grasses — and on the ap- 
 proach of cold frosty weather they go down into the 
 ground and remain inactive, and appear in the spring 
 again about half grown, which is the time they ex- 
 hibit their destructive qualities. Dr. Melsheimer, 
 says "the moths as well as the larva" of this species, 
 "vary much in the depth of their color, from a pale 
 ash to an obscure brown. The ordinary spots of the 
 upper wings of the moth are always connected by a 
 blackish line; where the color is of the deepest shade 
 these spots are scarcely visible; but when it is light- 
 er they are very obvious." f 

This moth is very abundant in Pennsylvania as 
 well as in the Eastern States, from the beginning of 
 June until the middle of September, and sometimes 
 when the weather is warm they may be found near the 
 end of the month, and even later. The transforma- 
 tion of the pupa occurs usually in July, and the fore- 
 part of September, ascording to the season. The fore- 
 wings are generally of a dark ash color, with faint 
 traces of wavy transverse bands; the hind wings are 
 a dirty whitish color, darkened towards the margin. 
 It expands from one inch and a half to one inch and 
 three-quarters. In a state of rest the wings overlap 
 each other flat upon the back. During the day it 
 lies hid in chinks and crevices of fences, walls or 
 barks of trees, and appears at night with hosts of 
 others, and is attracted by burning lamps, candles 
 or any other luminous body. The caterpillar is usu- 
 ally smooth, naked, and of a dark color, of a cylin- 
 drical form, tapering a little at each end, and is pro- 
 vided with sixteen legs. Among the various reme- 
 dies recommended for their destruction or to prevent 
 their ravages, is soaking the various kinds of seeds 
 in copperas water, or rolling them in lime or ashes; 
 but as the cut-worm does not attack the seeds, this 
 can have but little effect, except perhaps to accelerate 
 the germination and growth of the plant. Fall 
 ploughing the land intended to be planted in corn, 
 whereby the cut worms are thrown up and devoured 
 by birds, or exposed to the cold, seems also of doubt- 
 ful utility, although I have found many of them in 
 places of exposure, dead in the spring. The only 
 certain mode is to go to work, where it is known they 
 have commenced cutting the young corn or vegetables 
 and dig them up and destroy them by hand, a des- 
 cription of which is given by Mr. Asahel Foote in 
 the "Albany Cultivator" and 17th vol. of the "Now 
 England Farmer. S. S. R.
