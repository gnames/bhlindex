This Machine was Patented July 2, 1850, and has 
 received the highest premium at all the Exhibitions 
 wherr it has ever been contested; including New

 Agricultural Society. October 17th, 1850 ; Maryland

THE ABOVE DRILL is not liable to get nut of 
 repair, is exceedsnly simple in its construction, will 
 sow point rows in all irregular shaped fields, and pos- 
 sessess superior advantages to all others in the ease 
 and quickness with which it can be regulated to sow 
 any desired quantity of Grain per Acre., while the 
 draft upon the horses is twenty-five per cent, lighter, 
 and consequently with the same labor, can seed one- 
 fourth more ground per day than with most other 
 machines now in use. The objection so common to 
 Drilling Machines of becoming Cuoked if the seed is 
 not perfectly cleaned, is entirely obviated in the Sim- 
 ple and Peculiar construction of this Drill, as white 

MYERS' CHEMICAL ANIMAL MANURE. 

That of offering to the public a Manure which compriBes al 
 that could be wished — its cheapneea and surprising effects in pro 
 ducing larger crops in any kind of soil — is tasting and enduring 

The subscriber offers this Manure to the public with a full knowl- 
 edge of its powerful effects npon ground where used. This Ma- 
 nure must t;\ke Its precedence above all others; its adaption to alt 
 kinds of soil, and every particle of fertilizing properties being 
 preserved in the mode of manufacture, render it at once cheaper 
 than anv other man are used for all kinds of crops. Its effects are 
 wonderful A supply always on hand, WM. MYERS,

 To Mr. VVm. Myers-Sir— Having tried your Ihemico-Aniranl 
 Manure upon potato ground, this season, I find it produce one- third 
 more and larger potatoes than tlie best horse manure • n the same 
 ground. WM. K. Cox. 

The fotlowingadditioual certificate just received, speaks for itself. 
 VVoonsuRT, N. J , 10th mo 20th, 1851. 
 I have used upward of 1000 bushels of Wm. Mtsks' Animal 
 MAnnBE, on corn, potatoes, turnips, melons, and some other crops 
 during the present season, and am satisfied that it is an economical 
 and powerful manure, for turnips, radishes, and other root crops— 
 my experience has shown it to be especially valuable.

caps and short straw will not interfere in the least 
 with the regular distribution of the seed. It is war- 
 ranted to distribute the seed evenly; to sow and 
 quantity per acre commonly sown broadcast; to not 
 cut or break the grains: to be well made with good 
 materials and durable with proper care. 

Having sold about 400 of the above Drills the past 
 season, all of which met with the unqualified appro- 
 bation of the purchasers; and after careful and thor- 
 ough experiments, which have resulted in Still Great- 
 er Improvements, wo now feel warranted in saying 
 that Moore's Patent Seed and Grain Planter improv- 
 ed, is superior to any other machine for the purpose, 
 now in the market. 

Having made arrangements to furnish 1000 of the 
 above Machines for sale the coming Season, we shall 
 bo prepared, at all times, to supply orders without 
 elay. 

J6®"A11 orders addressed to the undersigned will 
 warrant prompt attention.

mat Manure about 33 acres of the pmirest land on my farm, and pnt 
 half in Oats, and II e balance in Corn. Although it was got in 
 quite late, and the Season very unfavorable for the Corn crop gen- 
 erally, yet notwithstanding. 1 can say that it is decidedly the best 
 Corn 1 ever raised, although I have farmed for 20 years, and have 
 had good Corn land, and Alanured well, as I thought, in Ihe old wuy- 
 While my neighbors' Corn was quite yellow and leaves curled up 
 with the drought, mine was green and growing rapidly ; then-fore, 
 I consider it one of the most vaiuable manures f ever used, and 
 shall take pleasure in recommending it to my iieighborsand oUiers^

SIDLE'SnUB, AUGUR AND BOX REGULATOR. 

THE Bubscriber residing in Dillsburg, York county, Pennaylra 
 ma., has invented a new und imprcived Augur for the boring gfhubi 
 and setting the boxes of wngon. carriage and other vehicle wheels 
 fi»r which I have obtained letieru patent. 

The Augur will bore both ends of the huh at the same time, or 
 either separately — and ia the most useful and important invention 
 of the age for inserting wagon boxes and the only Machine in ex- 
 istence by which they can be inserted exactly true— and is so per- 
 fectly simp'e in its construction, and constructed on such just me- 
 chanical principles, that it cannot possibly get nut of repair. 

With this Augur a set of boxes can he inserted in a few minutes 
 ' *' old system it requires hours to perform the 

— where unde 

same amount of work.
