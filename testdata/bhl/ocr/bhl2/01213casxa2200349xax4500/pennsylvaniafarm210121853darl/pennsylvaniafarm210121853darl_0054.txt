nXTURES rOR THE POnLTRT HOUSE. 

The house being completed, the next important 
 matter is the necessary fixtures for feeding, laying, 
 &c., &c., "Some farmers," says the author, "are in 
 the practice of feeding their fowls from the hand, 
 strewing it over the ground, while others throw down 
 corn in the ear, in a heap, and permit the fowls to 
 help themselves. This, however, is considered a 
 wasteful and slovenly mode, and well calculated to 
 invite rats and mice. ' 

Wo have found it more economical to keep grain 
 constantly before them, and for that purpose adopted 
 feeding-hoppers or fountains. Before adopting any 
 plan, we examined several works of poultry, bat did 
 not find any to our liking ; we then looked into Lou- 
 don's Encyclopedia of Agriculture, and there found 
 the desired object, but too complicated and costly 
 for our purpose; we, however, t ok a hint, and con- 
 structed one ourselves, of which the following fig- 
 ure is a fair represonfation, which we exhibited at 
 the Fair of the New York State Agricultural Socie- 
 ty, held at Albany, in 1842, which exacted some at- 
 tention, and which the Committee highly commend- 
 ed, and honored us with a diploma. 

This feeding hopper, as may be seen above, is 
 four feet square, two feet each -way— posts eighteen
