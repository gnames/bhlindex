is composed of ; and what I propose to do is to ex- 
 tend his linowledge a little further ; so that, instead 
 of his attention being confined to those generalities 
 on which it has hitherto been fixed, he should be 
 made acquainted with every thing in the soil, in the 
 crops, in the manure, in the air and in the water. 
 (Hear, hear.) 

Now, I ask you, gentlemen, as practical men, to 
 say whether you consider that this knowledge would 
 not be worth having, and whether it would not be 
 well for every man, as far as it may be in his power, 
 to seek to attain such knowledge. Well, now, having 
 thus prefaced my subject, I shall at once commence 
 the consideration of the manure made on the land ; 
 and I shall afterwards offer a few observations on the 
 rotation of crops, and the nature of those substances 
 which are offered to the farmer, under the name of 
 artificial manure. And let me here observe that I 
 shall be very happy, at the close of the lectui'e, to 
 hear any remarks, or to answer any questions which 
 may occur to any one present, having reference to 
 any thing which I may have said ; for some of the 
 things which I intend to present to your notice may 
 be so new, and so contrary to ideas previously im- 
 pressed on your minds, that you may doubt the truth 
 of my statements ; and the best way to settle any 
 question of that kind is to argue the point at the 
 (ilose of the lecture. (Hear, hear.) 

Let us begin with the far-famed farm-yard dung, 
 which is supposed to be so superior to all other things. 
 It is that which grows the crops, and which, in the 
 estimation of the farmer, is not surpassed by any 
 possible combination of substances. Now, what is 
 this farm-yard dung ? It is formed by acting upon 
 vegetable matter in some other way. You either take 
 a quantity of vegetable matter, and pass it through 
 the stomachs of animals, where it is acted unon and 
 the refuse passed out, or you put vegetable matter, 
 as straw or litter into the yards, and allow the excre- 
 ments. of animals to be mingled with it, and a slow 
 decomposition to take place. The whole being com- 
 mingled and mixed together is known by the name 
 of farm-yard dung. Now, a very little consideration 
 will show that the whole of the material which is 
 found by you. gentlemen, to be practically so useful 
 on the farm, is merely derived from vegetables ; so 
 that you are, in fact, applying the remains and re- 
 fuse of vegetables to renovate the land. This is the 
 whole secret of farm-y.ird dung ; it is vegetable mat- 
 ter, which, when partially decomposed, is re-applied 
 to the land, where it forms vegetables over again ; 
 BO that you are continually working, as it were, in a 
 circle. Thus, the same particles of matter imported 
 on the farm, perhaps in the shape of oil-cake, first 
 re-appear in the shape of a turnip, again as barley, 
 now as beet-root, now as wheat â€” the cyle of changes 
 continues until the identical particles are exported 
 from the land as beef or mutton or as grain. Now I 
 hope I shall be able to offer one or two ideas with re- 
 spect to the origin and nature of this farm-yard dung; 
 and let me say we can never have our ideas too near 
 the truth respecting ftie origin and nature of that 
 which is so constantly under our notice. Some gen- 
 tlemen have got an idea that animals have a mysteri- 
 ous power ; of what nature, it is impossible to say, 
 but they imagine that it really exists ; a mysterious 
 power, by moans of which they can change a turnip, 
 or a quantity of oats or greens, into a superior ma- 
 nure for land; and that food must have passed through 
 the animal before it can be really useful on the land. 
 That is the idea entertained on this subject by nine- 
 ty-nin3 Urmers out of a hundred. I must proceed 
 this evening to disabuse your minds of that errone- 

ous notion ; I must inform you that the manure ob- 
 tained from animals is always dependant, as regards 
 its value, on the food which the animal eats . and 
 that the excrements of animals are always less val- 
 uable, and less powerful in manuring principles, than 
 is the food consumed by those animals whilst produ- 
 cing the manure ; the green food, plowed into the 
 land, will giyo more manure to the land than the same 
 food eaten by the animals. Not that I would recom- 
 mend you, as a rule, to plow in your vegetables ; but 
 I wish you to remember that your sheep can deposit 
 nothing on the land but what they first received from 
 the food ; and that, under all circumstances, the 
 amount deposited will be less than that received. 
 Now let us look a little at this point. You know that 
 in one of our ordinary fire-places, when coals are put 
 into the grate and a light is applied to them, an ac- 
 tion takes place which makes the air above differ 
 from that below the fire ; without any mention of the 
 name of a single chemical element, you have only 
 to apply your plain common sense in order to be 
 aware that an action takes place between the air and 
 the coals, producing heat, and that the air above the 
 coals, (in the chimney,) is very different from the 
 air below the coals, which enters at the grate. Now, 
 you give an animal a certain amount of food _; that 
 food is taken into the system : the constant action of 
 the lungs, which inspire and expire the air, has the 
 effect of bringing into the system a large amount of 
 air. This air acts upon the food which is taken into 
 the system. By the combustion or burning of a cer- 
 tain amount of that food, animal heat is produced, 
 which keeps up the temperature of the animals, so 
 that they get a higher temperature than the surround- 
 ing atmosphere. The expired air contains the result 
 of that combustion, and resembles in composition the 
 air of the chimney ; another portion of food not used 
 for producing animal heat is laid upon the bones, 
 forming muscles, or fat ; and what the bullock itself 
 has no use for, is cast out of the system. Now, you 
 observe at once, that the animal, by acting in this 
 way on the food, actually deprives it of certain con- 
 stituents, and at tlie same time makes it less in 
 amount; so that, in fact, the only real action is one 
 which takes away certain portions of the food, and 
 renders the others more quickly soluble. All the 
 soluble parts of the food are passed out in the urine, 
 and all insoluble parts in the excrements. There is 
 a regular process performed in the laboratory of the 
 stomach, the effect of which is what I have thus de- 
 scribed. 

Now, the same thing takes place in the decomposi- 
 tion of vegetable matter. You lay down a large 
 quantity of straw, und you let the water fall upon it, 
 as well as the excrements of animals. You all know 
 what takes place. The heap gradually heats, and 
 this gradual heating is nothing more than the effect 
 of the gradual action of the air upon it. Certain por- 
 tions of the vegetable matter thus acted on by the 
 air are consumed and taken away, and the bulk be- 
 comes less ; so that, even in the process of acting 
 on vegetable matter, you lose a portion and it goes 
 off into the air, just the same way as the solid parts 
 of coals pass into the air by means of the chimney. 
 You all know that the solid parts of coal disappear 
 and leave nothing but ashes behind. The two cases, 
 are, in fact, identical. I may refer you to the case of 
 a hay rick, put up in too damp a state. In that in- 
 stance, an immediate action takes place from the 
 contact of the air with the moist hay, and that action 
 continues increasing, until, at last, the whole bursts 
 into a flame. Now, gentlemen, in cither case, in 
 making manure there is a diminution and a loss.
