Green Crops for Plowing Under. 

The great feature in the modern system of improv- 
 ing light soils is the use of green crops for plowing 
 under. 

That I may not be misapprehended by farmers in 
 this district, it is necessary here to say that when 
 speaking of the green crop system, I mean both the 
 crops that are plowed while green during summer, 
 and those that are left until the ensuing spring and 
 then plowed in dry. It is in both cases an improve- 
 ment by the use of green crops, there is only a differ- 
 ence as to the time of plowing in. 

Vegetable matter serves many of the purposes of 
 clay in retaining moisture, and preventing the escape 
 of fertilizing substances. Thus many soils which 
 contain little clay, are yet very fertile, because a 
 large portion of them is vegetable in its origin; such 
 are some of our rich garden moulds, or drained 
 swamps. 

Green cropping fortunately enables us to supply 
 the deficiency of vegetable matter much more easily 
 and cheaply than that of clay ; hence it has become 
 a prominent feature in the management of every far- 
 mer who is desirous of greatly advancing the value 
 of his land. The plants used as green crops are nu- 
 merous, and speaking of the theory or theories con- 
 nected with their operation, I may properly devote a 
 few words to the mention of those varieties which are 
 most important in this and other countries. Here, at 
 least in the Northern States, almost the only green 
 crop employed is clover. The properties and appear- 
 ance of this plant are so well knowti as to require 
 no description. Upon most soils it is easily grown, 
 and in those where it does not thrive naturally, skil- 
 ful manuring will generally bring it in. More would 
 be gained by plowing under the crops of two succes- 
 sive years than in any other way, but this plan would 
 not work well on most soils, and there are few far- 
 mers who would be willing to let land be idle so long 
 as this while it would bear any thing at all. Many 
 prefer to go on cropping until they can scarcely get 
 their seed back, and then are obliged to let the land lie 
 idle for a series of years in place of one or two, until 
 it has regained strength enough to bear another scan- 
 ty crop. Many, too, are unable to resist the tempta- 
 tion to cut and carry away the clover if its growth is 
 heavy. Their intentions are good early in the sea- 
 eon, but as haying time approaches they begin to 
 think of the two or three tons per acre of hay which 
 might be obtained by cutting, and finally the advan- 
 tages of present gains more than counterbalances 
 the prospective improvement of land. They after- 
 ■wards plow in the rowen, it is true, but that cannot 
 make up for the far heavier growth of which they 
 have already robbed the soil. Some excuse them- 
 selves by saying that so large a crop cannot be got 
 under, but it is not so, for this can be done by going 
 over the surface with a heavy roller, in advance of 
 the plow, and the clover then lies flat, and a pi 
 with a sharp coulter has no difficulty in turning it 
 over completely. Others recommend a heavy chain 
 hung from the plow beam so as to drag the clover 
 down before the plow share reaches it. On the light 
 soils of which I speak, these precautions will proba- 
 bly be needless for some time to come. 
 There are some soils where even a scanty yield of 

The Cocoa Nut Tree. 

Mr, Trcloar, of Ludgate Ilill, London, the cocoa- 
 nut fibre manufacturer, has published an interesting 
 pamphlet, showing the uses to which the various I 
 parts of the cocoa-nut tree are applied. The purpo- J 
 ses of utility to which this tree may be put are very 
 numerous. The Cingalese have a saying, "'that it 
 has ninety-nine uses, and the hundredth cannot be 
 discovered." From the full grown leaves are formed 
 mats, carpets, baskets, sails, tents and liquid mea- 
 sures. The cocoa-nut oil yearly imported into Eng- 
 land, is valued at £100,000. By means of mechani- 
 cal processes, secured by patent, the value of cocoa- 
 nut fibre has been much increased. It has been 
 found suited for the production of articles of great 
 utility and elegance of workmanship. A Great 
 Exhibition prize medal was awarded to Mr. Treloar 
 for the best specimens of matting, mats, brushes, 
 mattresses, and other articles made of cocoa-nut fi- 
 bre. — Scientific American.

Gallerea Cereana, (Bee Moth or Wax Moth.) 

Belongs to a Lepidapterous group called (Crambi- 
 dae) Or Crambians. This insect, which was probably 
 introduced into this country along witli the hive-bee, 
 [Apis mellijica,) is one of the greatest, if not the very 
 greatest enemy that that industrious and useful little 
 creature has to contend with. Notwithstanding that 
 bees are well armed with instruments of defence, 
 sufficient, too, to resist the attacks of more formidable 
 enemies, yet so insidious, so determined, and so per- 
 severing is the progress of the larva; of the bee-moth, 
 and so destructive is its ultimate character, that the 
 legal occupants of the hive are often compelled to 
 desert it, and yield it up to these pernicious intruders 
 altogether. The bee-moths were known to the an- 
 cients under the name of Tinea, and were noticed in 
 books of husbandry by Virgil and others, hundreds 
 of years ago. Linn^us, Kirby & Spence, and others, 
 have mistaken the differences in the male and female, 
 and accordingly regarded them as two distinct spe- 
 cies, (cereana and mellonella,) but for the sake of 
 avoiding confusion, modern naturalists generally 
 adopt the name given by ¥ahvicms,{Gallerea cereana.) 
 One striking peculiarity in the habits of this insect 
 IB, that it feeds upon a substance that is indigestible.
