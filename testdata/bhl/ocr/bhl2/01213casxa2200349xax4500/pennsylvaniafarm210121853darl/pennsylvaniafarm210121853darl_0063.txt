We present our readers, with the above admirable 
 specimen and correct copy from a daguerrotype like- 
 ness, of a pure Southdown Buck, lately imported, 
 together with three Ewes of the same breed.by Joseph 
 Cope of this county, for Francis Rotch, New York. 
 They were all from the flock of J. Kllman, and hav- 
 ing stopped here for a few days, previous to going to 
 New York, gave us the opportunity of having the 
 Buck daguerreotyped. 

We are somewhat familiar with fine Southdowns, 
 and had an opportunity some years ago, at the great 
 Southampton cattle show in En*land, to examine 
 some of their best specimens, but we have not the 
 impression of ever seeing a more finished sheep in all 
 the characteristic points of the Southdown breed, 
 than the Buck now before us. The engraving we i 
 consider the hest unflatkrcdporimit of a pure South- 
 down, which has appeared in any periodical in this ' 
 country. 

Our friend F. R-itch, in a letter to us from which 
 he has permitted us to make some extracts, says, "as 
 yiu have seen the sheep, sent me by Mr. EUman, 
 any comment on my part is nnnecessary. I request- 
 ed liim to send me specimens of his very best sheep, 
 and I have reason to believe, that as a mjitter of 
 fiienihhi;>, ho has done so, and I feel under great 
 obligatinns to him for, thus according to mc, what 
 money abme could not have procured. I have seen 
 larger slioep, but I think I have never seen more 
 beautiful or ra )re finished specimens of the breed. A- 
 Mr. Kllman remarks, I have yet to learn that sl/.f", 
 accompanied by coarseness, is a characteristic of a 

true Southdown." These sheep, on th" voyage, were 
 accompanied by an English Shepherd, through whose 
 care they arrived in fine condition. In importations 
 of sheep especially, this is the only safe plan, and is 
 the cheapest in the end. It is nselcss to purchase 
 abroad high priced stock, if they are to have only 
 chait'y attendance and feeding during the voyage. â€” 
 We lost some a few years ago, who died on the pas- 
 sage, which also happened to some of the large Ox- 
 fordshire sheep, imported by Jlessrs. Reybolds. 

This importation of Downs, selected as they have 
 been, with so much care, we consider quite an ac- 
 quisition to the country.

We publish two communications respecting this 
 fruit, and refrain from any remark-? at present our- 
 selves, till we have heai-d from J. Slater, and obtain- 
 ed a particular description of its growth, habit and 
 character of the blossom. We liave also ordered 
 some plants of him for comparison. 

I Owing to an accidental confusion of a few papers 
 I of our last m<mth's issue with that of the preceding 
 ni nth, some of our subscriber-; received tlie wrong 
 I number in the January cover. Where such a mis- 
 i take occurred, we should be obliged by being inform- 
 1 ed of it, when the correct copy will be immediato- 
 ! Iv forwarded. 

Several valuable communications have been re- 
 ceived and will appear in our next, having been 
 crowded out by the proce.-dings of thi; State .Vgri- 
 cultural Society, at its late meeting at Ilarrisburg.
