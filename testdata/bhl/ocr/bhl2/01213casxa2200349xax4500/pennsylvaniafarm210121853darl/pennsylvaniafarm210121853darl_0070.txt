IMPROVED STOCK— AuKIOULTURAL AND IIOR'L SOCIETIES. 

February, 

"Never was a greater misnomer than 'Ubtstratioiix' 
 when applied to the represontatiim of animals, us 
 jiut forth in most of our agricultural periodicals. I 
 know not why a man should not feel himself as re- 
 sponsibjefor the truth of the pencil as the pen, (if 
 degrees in truth were admissible,) I should say he is 
 yet more so, inasmuch as he professes to resort to it 
 by way ot Ulustratiiui a suljjoct better than it can be 
 djne by the pen. 1 

"In many instances the pictorial additions to a 
 publication are not important to the work itself— j 
 they are often but embellishm mts : but I take it, such 
 is not the case when a State A^nculniral Society pub- J 
 lishes its doings and its awards, and ^w^aportniits of! 
 the animals to which they have adjudg'^l premiums, { 
 as the best of their kind.— [See ijie transactions of 
 tlie N'. ,Y. State Agricultural Society for 1851. 
 'Lord Eryholme' is evidently a sick animal. 
 'Esterville' is quite poetical, and delights the imag- 
 inntiim. 

'Azelia,' I must suppose, has had great injustice 
 d.)n" her, for such a head and such coarseness, could 
 hanily claim the first premium in any society; where- 
 as I have been assured by those who have seen her, 
 that she is a very superior cow, though not quite so 
 fine in the head as wouhi be desirable. 

'Apricot' I doubt n )t, is well aud truthfully repre- 
 sented. Tlie engraving tells you she is young and 
 i mature, but of good promise. 

I now come to the premium 'Devon Cow,' and only 
 wonder the owner could do his herd such injustice as 
 to publish so gross a caricature; f.ir America, I will 
 venture to believ.e, does not possess more finished or 
 better animals than belong to it; and the New York 
 Agricultural Society, however its committees may 
 blunder, would hardly endorse this engraving as n:- 
 prexeiitii);; the best Devon Cow on their ground in 
 that year. Yet this very representation is put forth 
 by the Society by way, I presume, of instructing and 
 teaching the people what is the best model of a 
 Devon. 

Lastly the Hereford Bull, 'Tromp.' showing all the 
 characteristics of his breed, and lonkini/ in Ihe.eiii/ra- 
 ving as though ha well deserved the premium he was 
 awarded, strikes mis aa b;>th true and artistic. Mr. 
 Forbes, the artist, drew, I doubt not, what he saw be- 
 fore him, and has been well seconded by Mr. Carson, 
 the engraver. 

AVhile I condemn those attempts at portraits vvhich 
 libel tlieir originals, we must admire the perfect in- 
 tegrity of purpose and truthful intent of their own- 
 ers, in thus-entrusting the delineation of their beau- 
 tiful stock to the artists, without oversight or correc- 
 tion. 

These stand in strong contrast to themorei/Msi'jje.ss- 
 ^'A-c breeder, who orders his anin>als to be drawn af- 
 ter his own comcptioiis of the beautiful, making them 
 what he would have them to be, rather than what 
 they are, and puts them forth as portraitt. 

I cannot, however, turn from the illustrations in 
 t'le Transactions of 1851, without noticing the beau- 
 tiful and artist-like execution of the portrait of a 
 French Merino Uam, by M. Pen.se. I have seen n. .th 
 ing in our Agricultural Periodicals so excellent in 
 either drawing o.' cutting. The artist's name, who 
 ra ide the sketch,, I am sorrj', to say, does not appear," 
 Weh)p3 to mvko the Pjnnsylvania Farjn Journal 
 a complete II.!rd book for our State, and il our sug- 
 gDstion to brooders in the last numlwr, in respect to 
 registering pedigrees, should be oarrieii out, aocom 
 paniod as our pxg!s will be by approp.-iate illustra- 

tions of stock, we think it will make the most com- 
 plete and cheapest II ;rd book that could be gotten up. 
 We have made arrangements to have engravings 
 correctly executed, and if persons who choose to in- 
 cur the expense of this, the very best kind of an ad- 
 vertisemo'nt of their choice animals, will forward us 
 their daguerreotypes, we will attend to the engraving, 
 and see that a. faithful copy is taken. 

PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND AXXUAt 
 MKEl'INU OV THE l'ENN;;SYL,VASiIA AG- 
 HICULTOHAL SOCIETY. 

IlARRisuiruo, Tlesdav, January 18, 1853. 

In accordance with the fourth section of its Con- 
 stitution, the Pennsylvania Agricultural Society, 
 met on the third Tuesday of January, 1853, in the 
 Ilall of the House of Representatives. 

A quorum of members being present, the meeting 
 was organized by the motion ot J. S. Haldemau, elec- 
 ting C. B. Trego iis Secretary pro tern. 

Ou motion a committee of three, consisting of D, 
 Mumma, Jr., A. S. Roberts and J. Konigmacher, 
 wei-e appointed to invite his Excellency, the Gover- 
 nor, and the heads ot Department, to be present da- 
 ring the meeting. 

A. 0. Iliester, Chairman of the Committee on Field 
 Crops, appointed for the last Annual Exhibition, made 
 a report which, together with its recommendations,' 
 was, 01. motion adopted. 

REPORT OF TUG COMMITTEE ON FIELD 
 CROPS. 

The Comni'.ttee on Field Crops in this, the first re- 
 port, beg leave to congratulate the Society, that 
 whilst the last census presents our noble State as first 
 amongst her Sisters in some of the most important 
 staple crops, in the aggregate, the interest excited 
 by our Agricultural Exhibition and the competion 
 elicited by the offer of honorable premiums, has 
 brought to our knowledge anoth^'r fact, that without 
 extraordinary attention, aud without any idea of com- 
 peting for pruiniun^s. at th:; tini ,■ of planting and du- 
 ring cultivation, wv> are also first and foremost among 
 our sister Slates in tlie production of particular field 
 crops. 

The dissemination (f Agricultural information 
 generally, and tiie reports of special results from pai'- 
 ticular modes of plowing, planting and Hianuring, as' 
 sent forth by the Society, must exert .i most health- 
 ful influence in awakening the energies of the far- 
 mer, and exciting a spirit of laudable rivalry and. em- 
 ulation throug'.iout the Slate. And if such are to be, 
 the results of our effirts, w, m vy with great propriety 
 claim continued liberal patronage and public favor. 

The Committee would most respectfully at this 
 stage of their report, recommend a revision of the 
 premiums for field ci-ops, so as to excite greater pub- 
 lic attention and competition, and that premiums 
 hereafter f> bo dispensed in a m,)re liberal and exten- 
 di'd manner. AVo owe it to the cause in which we 
 are engaged, and our present resources, and future 
 pros[>ects will justify- the additional inducement. 
 The father of his ountry has written, and it has 
 now become a household saying, that the man who 
 can- make two blades of grass grow where but one 
 grewbefore, should hi considered a public benefactor. 
 h'X us liberally reward the n^-an.who bv his industry, 
 skill and science, m ikes two bushels of wheat grow 
 where but one grew before, and generously commu- 
 nicate to the society his manner of doing it, so tliat
