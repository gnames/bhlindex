AGRICULTURAL AND HORTICULTURAL SOCIETIES. 

Februart, 

ample of the States of Massachusetts, New York.Ohio, 
 Michigan and Marjhmd, who have liad puVilished 
 three very interesting and valuable works called the 
 "Transactions" of their respective State Agricultural 
 Societies. 

There are nineteen Agricultural Societies in the 
 State, very few of which had any conference with 
 the State Society, on anv subject of mutuality, and 
 nearly all have neglected altogether the importance 
 of concerted action, in the many ways that would fa- 
 cilitate both in contributing to the husbandry of the 
 country. 

The Perry County Agricultural Society was rep- 
 resented at the late State Fair, by a large display of 
 fine fruit, and articles of domestic manufacture, to 
 some of which premiums were awarded, and others 
 ■were spoken comraendably of by the Committees. 
 The Executive Committee passed a resolution tender- 
 ing their thanks to the Perry county Society, for the 
 handsome cimtribution they made to our Annual Ex- 
 hibition, and requested other county Agricultural 
 Societies to follow its example. 

The second Annual Exhibition, held at Lancaster, 
 was by far more extensive than the one of the pre- 
 cedingyear, and for a Second Exhibition was proba- 
 bly unprecedented in the history of State Agricultu- 
 ral Societies. The display of animals and articles 
 from the various parts of the State was very credit- 
 able, and the numbers entered for competion on the 
 books of the Society, was a large increase over the 
 former occasion, clearly showing that the zeal which 
 was manifested for a first Exhiliition had not in the 
 least abated by the lapse of another year. One 
 striking feature of the Fair, was the valuable speci- 
 mens of pure bred Fowls, which were exhibited in 
 great numbers, and deservedly attracted marked at- 
 tention, while they showed the importance of every 
 farmer looking to the interests of his poultry yard. 

The Plo ving JLitch was one of considarable in- 
 terest, and the strife among the plowmen who had 
 entered the contest was characterized by a good feel- 
 ing, and a generous emulation as to the reward of their 
 labors. 

The several departments of the Exhibition were 
 all well supplied with contributions, and presented 
 their usual attractions. The new and interesting 
 feature of the Exhibition made up by the collection 
 of valuable wools, owned and presented by Peter A. 
 Browne, Esq., of Philadelphia, afforded quite a treat 
 to the wool growers, who had the pleasure of exam- 
 ining tlie rare specimens, and suggests to the Society 
 the importance of aiding this distinguished gentle- 
 man in his new and laudable endeavor to improve the 
 wool culture, by pointing out the distinct difference 
 between hair and wool, or between wool that will, and 
 that which will not felt orshrink together. 

The Exhibition was deficient in the customary an" 
 nual address, owing to the engagements at tire time, 
 of the gentleman who had been invited for that pur- 
 pose. 

The Fair ground, situated on an eminence soai'ce- 
 ly a mile from Lancaster, and commanding a fine 
 view of the Conestogo Valley, the Columbia Railroad 
 for several miles, and the magnificent farms which 
 s irrounded it on all sides, was a beautiful location, 
 and for the purposes of an Exhibition, every way de- 
 sirable. 

The Committee of Arrangement, composed .almost 
 exclusively of members of the Lancaster Co. Agri- 
 cultural Society, upon whom devolved the many du- 
 ties to be performed, both before and alter the fair, 
 deserve the thanks of the Societv for the untiring and 

disinterested attention given to the interests of the 
 State Society during the exhibition. 

The registry of the names of the members shows 
 that they have been more than doubled since the last 
 annual report, there being now over four thousand, 
 two hundred members, all of whom are regularly 
 entered on the books of the Socicy, and alphabetical- 
 ly arranged, with their post-office address. 

Certificates of life membership have been issued to 
 •James Gowan, of Mount Airy; P. B. Savery, ol Phil- 
 adelphia, and S. C. Stambaugh, of Lancaster. This 
 mode of strengthening the treasury of the Society 
 has been less successful than might have been ex- 
 pected, for where it is considered that the tee for 
 life membership is only ten dollars, one would readi- 
 ly belie>e that the dictates of economy would in- 
 duce life members by the score. 

Two years have expired since the organization of 
 this Society, and would it be improbable to suppose 
 that eight years hence, hundreds who are members 
 now will be members then ? Who then can account 
 for there being but four life members now, when eight 
 years more shall have expired? All who continue 
 members for that period will have paid the whole a- 
 mount of the fee for life membership, and at the end 
 of that time will be still contributing their dollar 
 yearly. It might not be improper here to suggest 
 that the Vice President be desired to invite life-mem- 
 bers from their respective districts. Each Vice Pres- 
 ident furnishing ten life members, would give the 
 Society S^.^OO, or nearly double the amount of pre- 
 miums paid out the last year. 

It will be seen by the Treasurer's report that there 
 are funds in the treasury to warrant a very consid- 
 erable enlargement of the premium list, and an in- 
 crease of premiums for the next fair, which is con- 
 templated by the Executive Committee. 

The reports of the Judges who served on the sev- 
 eral committees for the last Exhibition, (of which 
 three thousand copies have Ijeen published, and dis- 
 tributed among the members of the Society,) show 
 a decided improvement on the part of exhibitors in 
 preparing statements in regard to culture, methods of 
 manufacturing, &c. 

It will be seen also that the Executive Committee 
 have increased the number of days for holding the 
 next Exhibition to four, so as to enable exhibitors to 
 have entered and arranged, in due time, all things 
 intended for competition, and to give the Judges more 
 time in their adjudications; and to enable them to 
 give that attention to the making up of their reports, 
 which their importance to competitors and to the So- 
 ciety so j ustly demands. 

In submitting such abstracts from the records of 
 the Society as have been designated, and which are 
 hoped will contribute to the interest of our Annual 
 Meetins, I cannot refrain from congratulating the 
 members upon the successful effort which has been 
 made by them to firmly establish in Pennsylvania an 
 institution, whose two yeais existence fully demon- 
 strates that it is rapidly approximating to an eqality 
 with kindred associations, whose beneficent influences 
 have aided agriculture throughout the wcrld. , 

We have reason to rejoice that as yet no obstacle 
 has been met with to retard the Society in its gradual 
 advancement to the position which it this day occu- 
 pies; and it is a gratification to know that the treasu- 
 ry of the State has been twice opened in its behalf, 
 and that the Governor of the Commonwealth, in his 
 late annual message, has recommended the appoiot^ 
 ment of an Agricultural Chemist to act in conjunction 
 with this and the County Societies. 

The interest that is felt in every part of the State
