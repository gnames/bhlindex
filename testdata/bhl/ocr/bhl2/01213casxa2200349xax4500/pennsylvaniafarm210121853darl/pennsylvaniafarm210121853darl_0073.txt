to have succed the first effort calculated to benefit 
 the fanner, the Legislative aid so confidently to be re- 
 lied on, the members of the Society now numbering 
 thousands, the money in its treasury, and the wil- 
 lingness of almost every one to assist in its promo- 
 tion, all indicate a permanency of the Pennsylvania 
 State Agricultural Society, which it is hoped will not 
 cease while agriculture contributes to the comfort 
 and happiness of man.

Geo Wai.kek's Mcidb op Cultivation. — I plowed five 
 acres of greeu sward for corn in the beginning of May, 18»2 
 and hauled one hundred loads of manure on the same. Af- 
 ter the manure was spread the ground was well harrowed, 
 and planted, the last of May, in rows :ii feet apart, running 
 east and west, from three to five grains in the hill. Two 
 bushels of lime, mixed with three bushels of plaster was ap- 
 plied to said five acres of eorn, very soon after it came up. 
 A plow did not enter the field after the corn was planted. 
 The gr«und was kept loose and mellow, and the grass and 
 weeds subdued by the use of the cultivator; making but lit- 
 tle use of the hand-hoe. A specimen of the corn was ex- 
 hibited at the State Fair, at Lancaster; it being ot the white 
 flint species, eight-rowed, small cob, and long ears, more 
 than one foot in length. In addition to the enormous yield 
 of 160 bushels of shelled corn to the acre, the same fl'ild, of 
 five acres, produced twenty tons of superior pumpkins, some 
 of which weighed more than forty-one pounds. Said field 
 ^is situated on one of the highest hills in Susquehanna coun- 
 ty, being an oak, pine, beech and sugar maple ridge. Soil, 
 a sandy loam. 

All of which is respectfully submitted.

WooDBonnNE, Susq'a eo., Oct. 14, 1852. 
 The subscribers Lave this day examined the corn raised 
 by Mr. George Walker, on his farm, at this place. 

' We measured carefully, with asurveyor'schain, onesquare 
 aero embracing an average of the field. 

We then counted the hills of corn on each outside row, 
 and found it 128 hills long, by 33 wide. We then selected 
 on average row, and beginning on one side, worked twenty 
 six hills, which we shelled and raeasurc-l, and there was a 
 little over a full bushel. 

The corn was not dry, and probably will shrink from } to 
 J. The present amount would be 160 bushels of shelled 
 corn — 120 of dry, merchantable corn.

James A. McCuea's Mode of Ct'bTiVATios.— The under- 
 signed respectfully presents the accompanying certificates of 
 the measurement of land, and its product in corn, in compe- 
 tition for the premium offered by the Agricultural Society 
 of the State of Penn.»ylvania. 

In this seclion of our State, such a crop is exceedingly be- 
 yond the average, and elicited warm encomiums from .all 
 who had an opportunity of seeing its luxuriant growth. The 
 mo le of cultivation was that usually employed in this coun- 
 ty, viz : 

A sod of more than 20 years growth was broken up in March, 
 harrowed thoroughly, thon hoe-harrowed aild furrowed out 
 for planting i and 3 J feet. The corn wasplantcd the first week 
 iuMay, about two-thirds with Dutton and the rest with mixed 
 variety. My neighbor farmers were ot opinion that if the mixed 
 variety alone had been planted, the yield would have been 
 materially increased. Of this, however. I am not satisfied. 
 The irregular outline of the field rendered it impracticable 
 to institute a comparison with that accuracy which should 
 always accompany agricultural experiments, to entitle them 
 to confidence. A given bulk of the mixed variety was found 
 to shell off about 4 per cent, more by measure and S per 
 cent, less by weight than the Dutton. 

Tlio Dutton corn was selected with reference to its charac- 
 ter for maturing (iarly — as the desire was to bring the field, 
 back into grass in the shortest possible time. 

The unusual character of the autumn, however, defeated 
 the ol.jeit. and also show(?d' no difference in favor of the 
 D.ittuo ovT the mixed variety, on the score of earlier matu- 
 rity. I may also add, that the fodder was very r.ank on the 

entire field, much of it from 15 to 16 feet high ; none under 
 12 ft. The Dutton corn with us is not often more than nine 
 or ten feet high. 

There was no manure employed, and the rapid growth of 
 the crops did not permit it to be stirred more than twice 
 with the cultivator. JAMES A. McCKEA.

Montgomery co., Jan. 6th, 1S53 
 I hereby certify that I superintended harvesting and mea- 
 suring the corn crop grown upon 1 1 acres 24 perches, on the 
 farm of Dr. James A. McCrea, in Whitemarsh township, Mont- 
 gomery county, and that said crop was 1028 bushels of shell- 
 ed corn. JOSEPH NIEMAN. 

I hereby certify that I measured accurately the field of 
 corn upon the farm of Dr. James A. McCrea, in August last, 
 and that the same contains 11 acres 24 perches of land.

Reubex Weioman's Mode op Cultivation.— The ground 
 was timothy sod. It was accurately surveyed by William 
 Weidman, ou the 1st of October, 1852, and found to contain 
 155i perches, less 4J perches than one acre. 

The mode of cultivation was as follows : Ploughed in the 
 spriog, th. n put in with potatoes, and after they were raised, 
 about 16 one-horse cart loads of manure spread over it, 
 then again ploughed about 8 inches deep and harrowed until 
 in good seeding order; and then sowed in with 1 bu. 3 pecks 
 of what is called the Ohio wheat with drill. The wheat was 
 reaped, shocked, and then stacked and remained there until 
 the 4th day of October, 1852. when it was threshed and 
 yieUei thirti/-e!r/ht and a half hmheh by measure; weighed 
 62$ lbs., which makes furti/ hmheh and twelve and two-third 
 Ihs. of wheat bv weight.

Description of the Manner in wliich John Willdn- 

son prod-need his Crop of Carrots, in 1852, meas- 

urin(j 1017 Bushels per Acre. 

The ground was a good sandy loam, principally mica and 
 slate; the fertile surface soil about eight inches in depth. 

It had been in Lucerne two years previors to breaking up 
 for Carrots. _ 

The sward was turned under nine inehesdeep in April, fol- 
 lowing the surface with the subsoil plough, to the depth of 

Land was manured with four hundred pounds Peruvian 
 guano per acre, and twenty-five two-horse loads of compost, 
 consisting of the scrapings of the manure yards, screenings 
 of guano, decomposed flesh of Horses Cows. *"■. »"'■ glean- 
 ings from banks of ditches, thoroughly incorporated with 
 the soil. Th« seed was planted the ath of May in drill, 2i 
 feet apart, using two pound seed per acre— the variety Long. 
 Orange. 

Thev were kept clean throughout the season;- were hand- 
 weeded but twice, and cultiv.ated principally with horses, 
 using a cultivator made by C. B. Rodgers, of Philadelphia, 
 expressly for the purpose; and also subsoiling the surface, 
 three times during the season between the drills, with a 
 light one-horse plow. The crop was harvested the last of 
 November. They were taken out by means of the large 
 subsoil plbw, running it seventeen inches in depth. 

By the use of the S. S. plow for digging carrots, and sim- 
 ilar roots, a strong team will do the work of twenty-five or 
 thirty men, and do the work equally as well as it can bo 
 done by manual labor. 

I preserve them in pits, cover them with earth, without 
 I any other covering. I sell them in the city of Pliiladel- 
 phia for feeding Horses; the price varies from S7J to fifty
