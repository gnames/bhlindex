AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES— -WORK FOR THE JIONTII. 

"The whole Exhibition exceeded the most .s!inj;i 
 expectations of its most ardent friends, and |groat 
 credit is due to the exhibitors, many of whom spar- 
 ed neither pains nor expense to make it respectable : 
 especially is praise due to our very worthy citizen, 
 11. N. McAllister, who gratuitously furnished grounds, 
 buildings, and every facility for the exhibition, and 
 whose large display of stock and agricultural imple- 
 ments contributed so largely to the interest of the 
 exhibition." 

The display appears to have embraced, besides 
 agricultural implements, a large number of very fine 
 horses, of high blood, and also for draught. Tho- 
 rough bred and grade cattle, most of the former of 
 Devon blood. Sheep of a cross between the Bake- 
 well and Southdown ; swine, poultry, dairy products 
 and honey. Fruit in considerable variety and of ve- 
 ry fine quality, consisting of apples, pears, plums, 
 peaches, quinces and grapes. Of the latter, W. G. 
 Waring exhibited specimens of a new native seed- 
 ling, called the "jelly grape." J. M. MeMinn also 
 xhibited a new native grape, of a "peculiar spicy 
 flavor." We should be pleased to have a few cut- 
 tings of these for testing in this region. 

A good display of large specimens of vegetables 
 ■was also made, and samples of wheat, corn and other 
 grains ; timothy hay, flowers, and articles of domes- 
 tie manufiicture ; the latter quite extensive. There 
 was also a ploughing match, and a trial of the sub- 
 poil, which "worked well."

 sent by the Railroad, they can be left at Mifflin Lew- 
 is's, Eagle Station, Columbia Railroad, with the pri-

 to encourage the institution.

WORK FOR THE MONTH. 

Farm. — This may be called the last leisure month 
 with the farmer, previous to commencing active ope- 
 rations out of doors. But little more can be said 
 than to observe directions of last month. Have a 
 full supply of wood, to last during the whole season, 
 cut up an 1 stor d away, ready for use. Have all 
 plows and other implements and tools examined and 
 put in perfect order; also gears. Haul fencing ma- 
 terials where they are to bo used. Make daily use 
 of the card on all cows, calves, and fattening ani- 
 mals. 

Fruit ORCiiARD.—Takeoff cuttings of gooseberries 
 and currants, and bury them J of their length in the 
 earth, till wanted for planting out; also quince cut- 
 tings, grafts of apple, pear, plum, cherries, peaches, 
 may now be taken and preserved in damp saw-dust, 
 or earth till wanted. The two latter must bo cut be- 
 fore any swelling of the buds has taken place. Graft, 
 ing the cherry will not succeed unless performed ve. 
 ry early. Budded peach trees which have missed- 
 may be successfully side-grafted, if the buds have not 
 swollen. Mulch, during this month of comparative 
 leisure, all young fruit trees. Pruning may now be 
 attended to. Head down all apple and other trees 
 of worthless varieties which are for grafting and form- 
 ing new tops. Leave some of the lower branches for 
 removal another season. If limbs are too large for 
 grafting, the young shoots which will be thrown out, 
 may be budded the following fall, or reserved for 
 grafting the following spring. Two seasons, at least, 
 should bo occupied in changing the heads of large 
 trees. A pole| pruning-saw, polo-chisel, and pole 
 pruning-shears, are necessary to perform this opera- 
 tion thoroughly. Cutoutallinside shoots and branches, 
 which crowd the head, and are useless. Those limbs 
 which have free access to sun and air, are the fruit- 
 bearing and productive ones. Branches should radi - 
 ate from the trunk, something after the fiishion of an 
 umbrella. When large limbs are removed, coat the 
 surface of the wo.ind with shellac dissolved in alco- 
 hol, to about the consistency of paint. Go round 
 every peach tree and shorten in the last year's growth, 
 about one-third, with the pole pruning-shears. This 
 has been very fully proven to result in larger and fi- 
 ner fruit, and may bo applied to other trees beside.? 
 the peach. Apply the wash, before recommended, 
 to trunk and large limbs. Grape-vines should be prun- 
 ed without delay. Trim gooseberries and currants, 
 by cutting out old wood and branches near the 
 ground, so as to give somewhat of the tree shape.
