' ] Root Culture. 

. The cultivation of roots for stock, either as a main 
 kiltemating crop, or even an important adjunct to our 
 •winter supplies, has as yet made but little progress 
 in Pennsylvania, We hold it to be part of the im- 
 proved system of farm management which is slowly 
 but surely making its way to public favor, and is cer- 
 tain eventually, to make an important item of our 
 farm products. 

Like many other innovations on the old system, 
 the progress of root culture has been retarded by too 
 much being claimed for it. We do not believe that 
 in the United States, for feeding and fattening stock, 
 roots are ever going to supplant Indian corn, which 
 has been aptly styled both meal, meadow and ma- 
 nure, and without doubtmakes a return per acre more 
 intrinsically valuable than any other known product 
 of the soil 

In England, where the culture of turnips and other 
 roots, is considered the basis of good husbandry, as 
 well also as in Flanders, Germany and France, our 
 Indian com does not floisrish to the same degree as 
 here, and there can be no argument drawn from 
 thence to induce the cultivation of roofs here to any- 
 thing approaching the sr.me extent 

Indian corn yields, on analysis, abD«t90 per cent, 
 oron a crop of 60 bushels to the acre, over 3,100 lbs. 
 of nutritive matter, to say nothing •of the value of 
 the fodder and the cobs. Turnips, sugai^beets, car- 
 rots yield on the other hand, by analysis, 85 to 90 
 per cent of wafer, with only 10 to 15 per cent of nu- 
 tritive matter. 'Tisonlyon account of the large yield 
 per acre, that any favorable comparison can bo made. 
 An acre of land, under good cultivation, can be made 
 to yield 30 tons of turnips or carrots, or G0,000 lbs. 
 Ten per cent of nutritive matter, will be 6,000 lbs. 
 This, however, is a full crop, and to make the com- 
 parison more just, the corn should be put up to 80 
 or 100 bushels per acre, which will give it the prece- 
 dence over the roots, considering the value of the 
 fodder. Roots compare more favorably with wheat, 
 oats, or barley. Thirty bushels of wheat to the acre, 
 yields only 1800 lbs. Oats about the same weight at 
 60 bushels to the a«re. We value root crops not us 
 a subsiiiufe in feeding or fattening, for Indian corn or 
 oats, but as an important adjunct, by which they can 
 each be made more efficient, and we think it the in- 
 terest of every farmer who has 100 acres of land, to 
 appropriate at least one or two acres to their culture. 
 They yield, in the first place, a very large amount of 
 nutritive matter per acre. They are not so exhaust- 
 ing to the soil as grain crops, but meliorate and im- 
 prove it, and by their succulent and juicy nature, 
 afford a fair substitute for grass, promoting health 
 and digestion, and by this indirect action, increase 
 the value of other food, enable the farmer to winter 
 more stock, and greatly augment the heap of the 
 barn-yard. In England, cattle -.itq Jalfened on tur- 
 nips. There is no occasion to try this here. AVhere 
 the food is so little concentrated, it must of course
