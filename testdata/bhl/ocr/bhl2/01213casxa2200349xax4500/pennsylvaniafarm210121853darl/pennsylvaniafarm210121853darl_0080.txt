take much longer than where grain is used. Neither 
 must the value of any food be judged entirely by the 
 degree of concentration of nutritiTe matter. Highly 
 concentrated food alone, would not support life or 
 health in animals without a certain amount of bulky 
 materials to produce the requisite expansion. 

All fattening animals should have a certain portion 
 of roots each day through the winter, but they are 
 particularly necessary for cows, young stock and 
 sheep. Cows in milk may thus be kept in profit 
 through the winter. When carrots are used, it im- 
 parts a pleasant flavor to milk and butter, and the 
 latter has a fine yellow color, nearly equal to that 
 from grass. Stock fed with roots, have usually fine, 
 sleek coats, and they continue thriving through a pe 
 riod, when the farmer is often satisfied, if he can 
 take them out to pasture in as good condition as they 
 were put into the yard in the fall. 

White and ruta baga turnips, sugar-beeta, carrots, 
 parsnips, potatoes, cabbages, are all used with more 
 or leas favor in different sections of the country as 
 food for stock. We have bad some experience with 
 each of these, and raised one season 1200 bushels of 
 sugar-beets, which we fed with great advantage. 
 They require to be gathered before hard frosts, which 
 affect a chemical change in the saccharine matter, on 
 which their value much depends. The difi'erence of 
 opinion as to the value of the sugar-beet, is, perhaps, 
 owing to neglect in this particular. 

The ruta baga is easily raised, producing 1,000 
 bushels to the acre, and interferes less with the far- 
 mers time at the busy season than either beets or car- 
 rots,but they are nut so nutritious. After sowingabout 
 midsummer, no attention is required till after har- 
 vest. In corn, oats, wheat, the predominating prin- 
 ciple is starch in connection with gluten. In pota- 
 toes starch is united with albumen in about the same 
 proportions as with gluten in wheat. Turnips have 
 less starch and nitrogenous compounds than parsnips 
 or carrots, and also less sugar. Beets contain about 
 10 per cent, of sugar, and carrots and parsnips 5 to 
 7 per cent. 

According to Johnston, an acre of carrots, of 1000 
 bushels, of 60 lbs. each, contains more nutritive 
 matter than any other crop of either roots or grain, 
 excepting Indian corn at 100 bushels to the acre, and 
 even this if the value of the fodder is not estimated. 
 Carrots require more of the season to mature than 
 either of the other crops mentioned, and greater care 
 in management, but from the experience of some of 
 ur be St cultivators, we are inclined to think, are, on 
 the whole, to be preferred. The seed is long in veg 
 etating, and is apt to be choked with the weeds, but 
 this is the fault of the farmer, and may easily be 
 prevented. In all root crops, but especially with 
 carrots, let the ground be thoroughly plowed and sub- 
 soiled very early in the spring, if not done in the 
 fall, which is better, and then harrow thoroughly at 

least once a week tiS planting time. Every harrow- 
 will destroy millions of weeds, by exposure to 
 hot sun, as fast as they germinate, and we have been 
 prised at the effects of this, in producing clean 
 tillage for the subsequent growth of the crop. An 
 excellent plan, recommended by, and we believe orig- 
 inating with Professor Mapes, is to sow long scarlet 
 radish in equal parts with the carrots. These come 
 up quickly, serving to indicate the rows, admitting 
 of early work with the cultivator, and when pulled 
 up, either to market or for the manure heap loosen 
 the soil around the carrot, and promote its growth. 
 For particular directions for cultivating carrots, we 
 refer to our last number, and the premium crops of 
 Professor Wilkinson of Mount Airy â€” 1017 bushels 
 to the acre. The long orange carrot we prefer. Two 
 to three lbs. of seed will be sufficient, and allow for 
 thinning out. It should only be planted h sn inch 
 deep. If well rubbed between the hands, it will 
 prevent its sticking together. In all root culture, it 
 should be remembered ploughing and snbsoiling, 
 heavy manuring with barn-yard manure or guano, 
 the latter at the rate of 500 or 600 lbs to the acre are 
 indispensable to success. Carrots are latterly much in 
 demand as food for horses, and sell readily at the liv- 
 ery stables in our large cities, from 35 to 50 cents per 
 bushel. The proportion of two bushels of oats, and 
 one of carrots, keeps a horse in finer condition, and 
 givos a better coat than 3 bushels of oats. 

Directions for Plautlns Trees, 
 As the season is at hand for planting out fruit and 
 ornamental trees, we give a few plain directions, 
 is a hackneyed subject, but it is of so much conse- 
 quence, to be correctly done, that we may be excus- 
 ed for calling attention to it again at this time. There 
 are many exceptions 'tis true, but from our own ob- 
 servation, it appears to be the general impression that 
 the planter discharges his whole duty by incurring 
 the cxpenie ot paying the nurseryman for a tree, ta- 
 king it home, and covering the roots, crammed into a 
 small hole, with earth enough to keep it in an upright 
 position, or, perhaps, in some oases, with extra care, 
 preventing its falling over by being secured to a stake. 
 Other more important duties then engage his atten- 
 tion, and if the tree does not thrive, or gets broken 
 down by the cattle, or if, within a short time, it does 
 not produce some very fine fruit, equal to any in the 
 market, the conclusion at once is come to that there 
 must be some mistake in the variety or in the health- 
 iness of the tree, or that fruit-growing is unprofita- 
 ble. 

Now, it should be recollected that a tree or shrub 
 is an organized living structure, having organs of 
 nutrition, circulation growth, assimilation, and 
 that every violent injury to these, or interruption 
 to their functions, as in transplanting, affects, more 
 or less its health and vitality. The object in planting
