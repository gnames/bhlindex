is to place it under circumstances to resume these 
 functions, with the least injury and delay, and to 
 promote its future growth and vigor. First, in re- 
 spect to preparing holes : the size of these depends 
 on the size of the roots, but should be at least one 
 to two feet wider than they reach, so as to admit of 
 their extending readily in their early growth into the 
 loose earth. They should be about two feet deep, and 
 surface soil, leaf mould or a compost formed of two 
 parts rich earth, with one part of barn-yard manure 
 prepared some months beforehand, bo filled in around 
 the roots and small fibres, the poorest earth being 
 placed on the surface. Some planters make holes 
 5 to 6 feet in diameter. The larger the hole and 
 quantity of rich, loose earth, the more rapid will be 
 the growth, and earlier the profit. 

Avoid especially deep planting, one of the most 
 common errors, and most fatal. After the earth is 
 settled, the tree should stand about the same depth 
 as before. Pulverize the earth well, and when the 
 hole is s full, a bucket of water poured in settles it 
 well and thoroughly about the fibres, leaving no 
 hollows which oft?n cause decay, but bringing it in- 
 to contact with every part. Avoid the too common 
 practice of settling the earth among the roots, by 
 shaking the tree up and down, which brings them in- 
 to a vertical and unnatural position. When the re- 
 mainder of the hole is filling up, press the foot around 
 the tree, to establish it firmly, and secure with a stake, 
 to prevent being disturbed by the winds. Any roots 
 which may have been injured in taking up, should 
 be carefully out off at the end, with a sharp knife, 
 from the under side. If there has been much muti. 
 lation, the top and branchei should be shortened in, 
 to restore the balance of the system, or the evapora- 
 tion from the leaves may be greater than the roots 
 can supply. After planting, mulch the ground with 
 short litter, of any kind, leaves, tan, &c., which keeps 
 the ground damp, and is greatly preferable to frequent 
 surface watering, which bakes the soil, and prevents 
 the fertilizing influence of the atmosphere. 

As soon as convenient after the tree is planted, ap- 
 ply with a white-wash brush, soft-soap and lye in 
 equal parts, to the body and limbs. The check to 
 growth consequent upon transplanting, affects the 
 bark unfavorably, making it dry and hard, and of 
 sluggish circulation. If more convenient, the pro- 
 portion of a pound of potash, dissolved in a gallon 
 of water, will answer the same purpose. It bright- 
 ens and cleans the bark, and we have found it very 
 useful. 

In addition to mulching, cherry trees, particularly 
 of large size, should have, the first summer, rye 
 straw tied up their trunks, to avoid the effect of the 
 hot sun. They generally branch higher up than oth- 
 er trees, exposing more of the trunk, and wo think 
 can often be saved by this method. There are more 

frequent failures in transplanting cherry than other 
 fruit trees. 

Trees should not be planted for orchard culture in 
 ground laid down to grass, but should be kept under 
 cultivation for a few years, at least. A crop of corn 
 w.ll be no injury the first season, if the exhaustion 
 of the soil is made up, and afterwards, potatoes or 
 other hoed crops should only be admitted. Clover 
 may be sown, and remain for a couple of years, and 
 then be plowed down, as an alternation, with potatoes 
 or other roots. When this is done, care must be ta- 
 ken to leave no rubbish as harbor for mice. As re- 
 gards varieties of fruit, we refer to list in former 
 number, of American Pomological Society, merely 
 premising that we have fears that some of the fine 
 eastern fruits are not to prove so desirable in Penn- 
 sylvania, and that it will be safer to plant extensively 
 only of such kinds as have been well and fully prov- 
 en to be adapted to our soil and climate. We would 
 by no means discard all that have not been proven 
 h3re, but plant moderately of them. 

Wash for Fruit Trees. 

Some years ago, we were called on by a man nam- 
 ed Peter, and hailing from New Jersey. He had prun- 
 ing materials with him, and offered to perform that 
 operation, and also to put unhealthy and unproduc- 
 tive trees into speedy bearing condition. We gave 
 him employment for a few days among our trees, and 
 after pruning was all performed, with some interest, 
 wont around with him to find out his application to 
 promote fruitfulness, and which he called his pana- 
 cea. 

We took him to the first tree old enough to bear, 
 telling him, "Peter, this tree seems tig enough to 
 have fruit, has been standing in good soil for several 
 years, what had better be done." Peter would walk 
 round and round the tree, very quietly examine eve- 
 ry part of it, and pausing for a minute or two, as in 
 deep thought, would break forth thus:â€” "Well now 

Mr. , in my opinion, the best thing for this 

tree, is to get some soft soap and lye, mix them half 
 and half, take a white wash brush and rub with this 
 mixture up and down to trunk and branches." This 
 seemed very reasonable, and we would pass on to the 
 next, remarking, "Peter, here is a tree differently af. 
 footed from the other, tliai had been making very lit- 
 tle growth, but this appears to have grown rapidly, 
 still there is no fruit; what had better be done with 
 ^/ii's subject?" Peter would appear puzzled, would 
 reflect a little longer than before, passing around and 
 around the tree, scrutinizing every part very closely, 

and then break forth again, "well now, Mr. -, . 

in my opinion, (laying considerable emphasis) the 
 best thing for this tree, is to go; some soft soap and 
 lye, mix them half and half, take a white wash brush 
 and rub with this mixture itp and down to trunk and 
 branches."
