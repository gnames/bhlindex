.pose writing out our plan of manufacturing it, and 
 our experience regarding its benefits, for tlie "Farm 
 Journal" some wet day, when we have a little lei- 
 «ure,) with about 18 loads to the acre. It was then 
 sown in wheat, and the next season we had about 
 twenty bushels to the acre from it. The stubble was 
 then plowed down and the ground manured as the 
 preceding year, and limed again and seeded in wheat: 
 and we had from it rather more wheat than the year 
 before. It was seeded in clover along with the wheat, 
 in the spring, and remained in grass from that time 
 until last spring, when it was plowed for corn. The 
 clover had pretty much worked out, and a thick-set 
 sward of green-grass had taken its place. We gave 
 it last spring lli loads coarse barn-yard manure per 
 acre, on the sod, and plowed it under, and then limed 
 the inverted soil. The cultivation it received was 
 just the same as No. I. This field contained eight 
 and one-fourth acres, and had 89i rows of corn on it, 
 making 108J bushels to the acre. 

No. S had never given us a heavy crop of any kind. 
 It lay about a mile from the barn-yard, and never 
 had but one coat of barn-yard manure. It had been 
 limed at different times, and had been in grass about 
 six years previous to being plowed. It was limed oli 
 the sod in the Ml of '51. Thinking deep plowing 
 might have some effect on it, we plowed it some two 
 inches deeper than ever belore. After the corn came 
 up it received about 400 lbs. Chappell's fertilizer per 
 acre, and was cultivated the same as the others. The 
 field contained ten acres and sixty-nine perches, and 
 produced 'Jj'6 busliels in the whole; making 95 J bu. 
 to the acre. 

No. 4 was on a farm two miles or more distant 
 from the home place, and was not under our immedi- 
 ate oversight. It was plowed with a Wiley plow, 
 with one pair of mules attached, and of course was 
 not plowed deep. It was limed on the sod just before 
 plowing, and after the corn was up, we appliedabout 
 30J lbs. per acre to it of Chappell's fertilizer. The 
 seed was not good, being picked promiscuously out 
 of the crib just before planting, and at least one- 
 eighth of it never came up. It was re-planted, but 
 tlie re-plants never came to much. Included in the 
 field was a new clearing, of some three acres, and 
 which was outrageously stony, and withal so gras- 
 sy, that the hoes though well applied, could not pre- 
 vent the growth of much of it. It was worked by a 
 one-horse cultivator entirely, and by hoes. 

The field contained 23 acres, and produced 1812 
 bushels of corn, which is 78| bushels to the acre. 

All the fields were accurately surveyed by a prac- 
 tical surveyor. The corn was all carefully measured 
 in a barrel by two persons, and the number of bar- 
 rels carefully noted down. The barrel was of the 
 largest size flour casks, and was always heaped as 
 much as would lay on it. This same barrel was fill- 
 ed by the same persons that filled all the others, and 

in the same way, with the same amount of corn, 
 which was then shelled, and the shelled corn mea- 
 sured, and the calculation made from that. Field No. 
 2 had some of the largest and finest ears on it that 
 we ever saw. One weighed one pound and thirteen 
 ounces, and there were many others as heavy, if not 
 heavier. 

We think it likely that the agricultural salts in- 
 creased the crops in fields 3 and 4, some eight or ten 
 bushels to the acre. 

The yield of these fields are considerably ahead, 
 we have reason to believe, of the average crops of our 
 county ; but we see no reason why they should be 
 so. Wo use no magic, neither do we resort to pow- 
 erful and transient stimulants. Thorough working 
 of the land, we consider the chief agent of our suc- 
 cess. Who is there that cannot do that ? Five years 
 ago we raised llO'J bushels of corn to the acre on a 
 field of nearly nine acres. But we relaxed no effort, 
 and now we have, on a small field, beaten that. 
 Who will beat us ? K. J. D.

 Directions for Measuring Cattle so as to ascertain 
 tlieir Weight wliUe tiviug. 

SELECTED BY J. 

TROM A FOREIGN WORK. 

This is of the first utility for all those who are not 
 experienced judges by the eye, for by following these 
 directions, they will come to the weight within a 
 mere trifle : 

Take a string, put it round the beast, standing 
 square, just behind the shoulder-blade; measure on 
 a foot rule the feet and inches the animal is in cir- 
 cumference ; this is called the girth ; then with the 
 string, measure from that bone of the tail which plums 
 the line with the hinder part of the buttock ; direct 
 the line along the back to the fore part of the shoul- 
 der-blade ; take the dimensions on the foot-rule as 
 before, which is the length, and work the figures in 
 tha following manner : 

ft. in. 
 Girth of an ordinary bullock, - - - C — 4 
 Length along the back, ----- 5 — 3 

Which, multiplied together, make 31 square su- 
 perficial feet. That again multiplied by 23, the num- 
 ber of pounds allowed to each superficial foot, of all 
 cattle measuring less than 7 and more than 5 feet in 
 girth, makes 713 lbs.; and allowing 14 lbs. to the 
 stone, is 50 stone, 13 lbs. Where the animal mea- 
 sures less than 9 and more than 7 feet in girth, 31 is 
 the number of lbs. to each square superficial foot. 

Again, suppose a pig or any small beast should 
 measure 2 feet in girth, and 2 feet long. 

Girth of a small pig, 2 feet. 

Length along the back, - -•- - - -2 " 

Which, multiplied together, makes 4 square feet.
