vegetation, while many heads being left on the ground, 
 had sprouted to considerable length. This is conclu- 
 sive evidence, that so far as vegetation is concerned, 
 wheat does not require to be deeply buried, but will 
 most readily germinate on the surface, or by being 
 put in deep enough only to afford the necessary heat 
 and moisture. And as our mode of treating it should 
 be as nearly in accordance with the laws of nature 
 aa may possibly be, we are led to the conclusion 
 that it should, in all cases, be covered enough only to 
 protect it from the extremes of heat and cold, in which 
 we must be guided, in a great measure, by the time, 
 soil and climate. 

As to implements, the harrow, or something sim- 
 ilar to it, was probably one of the first made 
 use of for putting in grain. We are informed 
 that in some of the Oriental countries, the marsh- 
 es and wet grounds along the rivers were prepar- 
 ed for the reception of the rice by no other tillage 
 than the treading of their oxen, asses, &o. And 
 having been thus rudely prepared before sowing the 
 rice, the same was afterwards covered in a similar 
 manner, by these untutored cultivators. Others again, 
 instead of the strong and well-constructed harrows 
 that are found upon our farms, had a few logs of wood 
 or the branches of trees coarsely tied together, and 
 dragged over the ground. In many countries still, 
 wooden harrows are more common than those which 
 grace our farms. And in every instance, it will be 
 seen that the improvement of implements has kept 
 regular pace with the advancement of agricultural 
 science itself— leaving us still, as ever, in an age of 
 improvement. A large proportion of the wheat now 
 sown, is, no doubt, put in by the harrow, principally, 
 .perhaps, because it is a cheap instrument, and will 
 answer the purpose. From what has been said re- 
 specting the vegetation of wheat, the impression might 
 perhaps, be left on the minds of some, that it was 
 the only proper instrument ; but as it must be pro- 
 tected from the extremes of heat and cold, and for 
 other causes, we find its use attended with decided 
 disadvantages. After sowing a field broad-cast, and 
 harrowing over it, there is frequently, if not always, 
 a considerable quantity left uncovered, which is gen- 
 erally destroyed by the fowls of the air ; if not, it 
 will immediately vegetate, and, subjected to the 
 scorching heat of the sun for a few days, it withers 
 and dies. Actual experiment has also shown that 
 some which was slightly covered and exposed to the 
 immediate action of the rays of the sun, sprung up 
 suddenly, but not having sufficient earth to retain 
 the requisite amount of moisture, soon faded away, 
 while that which was slightly shaded, perhaps by a 
 few clods only, was enabled to retain its moisture, 
 and consequently grew up vigorously. But again ; 
 unless the ground is entirely free from all rubbish, 
 the harrow is very apt to drag the grain together, 
 thus distributing it unequally, crowding it in some 

places, so that it will not have sufiicient room for a 
 vigorous and healthy growth, leaving none at all in 
 others. The former may frequently be seen by the 
 presence of many heads of a diminutive size, tholat- 
 ter, as a natural consequence, by the entire absence 
 of any. Thus, we may conclude that by harrowing 
 in wheat, a great deal of the seed is entirely lost, not 
 only by not being covered at all, but also by being 
 buried too deeply, or not enough so. In the latter 
 case, it is also more apt to be winter-killed. 

The plow is used by many of our farmers in pre- 
 ference to the harrow, and is, no doubt, under many 
 circumstances, superior to it; but it is, perhaps, 
 chiefly used, only for the want of a better implement. 
 Its use is generally attended with an increase of la- 
 bor. So much so, th.at the differenc3 of it alone, for 
 a few seasons taken together, would purchase imple- 
 ments much better suited to the purpose. Like har- 
 rowing, ploughing in grain is also a wasting of seed. 
 While it is, in general, mjre effective in covering 
 the seed, there is still some left uncovered, and the 
 rest quite unevenly, which will, of course, make its 
 appearance at different periods, and be more or less 
 retarded, crowded and unequally nourished during 
 its growth, and some, perhaps, buried so deeply as 
 never to come to light. The cultivator is, by some, 
 preferred to the plow or harrow, as a medium between 
 the two, and is, perhaps, superior to either, under 
 certain circumstances. But the whole system of 
 broadcast sowing is more or less defective, compared 
 with the more regular one of drilling, which is made 
 apparent by its yielding, in most cases, less per acre 
 from the same quantity of seed, and many times, 
 even from a larger quantity. 

Drills were utterly unknown until some time in 
 the sixteenth century, and to the celebrated Jethro 
 Tull is accorded the honor ot having been one of the 
 first to construct and make experiments with machi- 
 nery in the art of culture. The drill was certainly 
 a great improvement upon all other implements, but 
 like every thing else in the progress of improvements, 
 it was viewed as an innovation upon the old estab- 
 lished customs. But after repeated trials and exper- 
 iments, it established successfully its claims and su- 
 periority, and but little wheat is now sown broad- 
 cast in the most highly cultivated countries, which is 
 a sure presage of its merit. It is not only a saving 
 of seed, which alone is a consideration of no little 
 importance, but facilitates labor as compared with 
 the plow, and besides, it seems to be admirably 
 adapted to conformity with the laws of nature — 
 avoiding, exposing a large portion of the seed on the 
 surface, by covering it all, which is absolutely neces- 
 sary for its protection, in our climate ; as also its 
 being buried too deeply, which is a material injury 
 to its vegetation. A greater number of acres can be 
 sown per day, more evenly covered, thus considera- 
 bly lessening the cost of agricultural labor, and giv-
