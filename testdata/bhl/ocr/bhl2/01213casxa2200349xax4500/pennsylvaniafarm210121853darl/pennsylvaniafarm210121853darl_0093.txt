 A Model Bam. 
 [A Correspondent sends us the following' account of 
 a Model Barn, on the farm of George Wilson, Esq., 
 near Bellville, Mifflin county, Pa.] 

It is a hundred and seventeen feet long, by sixty- 
 fiye wide; there is stabling undsr the whole, except a 
 wagon shed at the one end, the whole width of which 
 is twenty-two feet, and is as long as the barn is wide, 
 made to drive through; an arched cellar of thirty 
 feet in length, and eight or ten wide; takes up a part 
 of the wagon shed. Above the stabling are the hay- 
 mows; then seven or eight feet above is the main 
 floor running the whole length of the barn — the en- 
 trance being at the end; under this is another floor 
 forty by eighteen feet running across the barn — 
 used for cleaning grain; under the main floor are the 
 graneries, — corn cribs are over the wagon shed on 
 either side of the upper floor — threshing machine is 
 arranged with horse power in the main floor at one 
 side, so as not to be at all in the way, and the horses 
 ■work in the wagon shed beneath, — an upright post 
 passing through the floor, and connected with the 
 main wheel. Horses and driver are always in the 
 dry — protected from a hot sun in warm tveather, and 
 from the chilling blasts of the cold, inclement sea- 
 son. The straw and other things for the manure 
 yard passes out in front over a scaffold level with the 
 upper floor, which it at least twenty feet high, makin, 
 it very easy to put out a large amount of straw. Th 
 hay all descends seven or eight feet below the upper 
 floor before it reaches the bottom of the mow, so 
 that it is no trouble to unload it, but without a more 
 minute discription I must say that this is the most 
 convenient barn that I have ever seen. It is not the 
 "double decker" barn of which there are many in 
 some parts, but this one was planned by the owner, 
 projected by him alouB, his carpenters working by 
 his directions. The whole cost was about .$3,000 — it 
 is on a fine farm of near two hundred acres of tillable 
 land. R. F. W. 

confined, I succcedjd in raising more chickens than 
 many of the large farmers in the vicinity, who gave 
 theirs the range of their large domain. 

The practice observed was this: — On taking the 
 hens from the nest, I tied them to a barrel, laid 
 lengthwise on the ground, where they were allowed 
 to remain until the chicks became large enough to be 
 placed in the yard. But it was to the feed that I at- 
 tributed my success. On taking the chicks from the 
 nest, I fed them on liard boiled eggs, chopped up fine, 
 for the first few days. When two or three days old 
 I give them an alternate feed of corn meal, slightly 
 dampened, but entirely discarded all sloppy mixtures. 
 After the elapse of a week or ten days, I commenced 
 giving them whole wheat, which I have invariably 
 found to agree with them better than any other grain. 
 I still, however, continued to feed the egg untill they 
 got to be ten days or two weeks old, and what seem- 
 ed to be most singular was, I had not a single case 
 of gapes in the whole flock. That it was attributa- 
 ble to the food given them I am fully satisfied. It was 
 certainly very palatable to them, and in ray opinion, 
 is the most natural food that can be given to the new- 
 ly hatched chick. Whether new to your numerous 
 readers or not, I am not able to say. The same prac- 
 tice was adopted by some of my acquaintances with 
 like success. 

I, however, from the small amount of liberty en- 
 joyed by my flock, had a most formidable enemy to 
 contend with. The vermin became very numerous, 
 which I succeeded in subduing by the free use of 
 grease, which I regard as the cheapest and most con- 
 venient remedy, and if persevered in will ultimately 
 exterminate them. I have tried it, and although not 
 new to your readers, I desire to add my testimony in 
 favor of its general use. P. J. P. W.

 Management of Poultry. 

MuNcv, Pa., Dec. 20th, 1852. 
 Messrs. Editors: — 

As you solicited in a late num- 
 ber of your valuable Journal, an exposition of the 
 views and experience of those engaged in agriculture 
 and the rearing of stock, I am induced to give you 
 my experience in raising Poultry. Having from my 
 youth had a strong attachment for the feathered 
 tribe, I procured, about a year since, a fine pair of 
 Chittagong chickens, which I placed in company 
 with six other hens, (the common dung-hill fowl,) 
 and from the seven hens I raised upwards of 130 
 chickens the past season. I confined the laying hens, 
 together with the chickens, after they became large 
 enough to be mischievous in the garden, in a yard 
 not exceeding twenty feet square, and although thus

 Fattening Poultry. 

Mr. Editor: — 

From an old work on Agriculture 
 published in England some sixty years since, I ex- 
 tract the following remarks in relation to the fatten- 
 ing of poultry, which are at your service. 

Fattening Chickens.— Very short time is neces- 
 sary. If a chicken is not fat in a week, it is distem- 
 pered. Poultry should be fattened in coops kept ve- 
 ry clean. They should be furnished with gravel, but 
 with no water. Their only food barley meal, mixed 
 with water, so thin as to serve them for drink. Their 
 thirst makes them eat more than they would, in order 
 to extract the water that is among their food. This 
 should not be put in troughs, but laid upon a board, 
 which should be washed clean every time fresh food 
 is put upon it. It is foul and heated water which is 
 the soul cause of the pip. The preventive is obvi- 
 ous.
