(usually towards the end of Noyember,)they are shut 
 up, to the number of ten or twelve (not more) in a 
 dark still place, where they can neither see light nor 
 hear the cries of those kept for laying. They 
 remain in that prison until they have attained the 
 greatest degree of fatness, and are ready for killing; 
 that moment should be seized, otherwise they would 
 very soon turn bare and die. They are then cram- 
 med twice a day, by putting into their craws (by 
 means of a tin tube) as much as it will hold of maize 
 (Indian corn) boiled in water. The tube is used be" 
 cause the bill of the goose, being furnished with 
 teeth, the person who should attempt to perform that 
 operation by hand would soon have them scratched 
 and torn to pieces. By this means, the goose acquires 
 a prodigious fatness, so that a pair sometimes weigh 
 from fifty to sixty pounds. Their liver weighs from 
 one pound to a pound and a half— is white and deli- 
 cate; but has a slight bitterness to the taste, which 
 the liver of the duck has not. The hearts are large 
 like a small apple; and when dressed on a gridiron 
 are excellent eating. The feet are boiled, after which 
 they are fried the same as the tongue. 

Here is the process for fattening ducks. I do not 
 know how it will suit the tastes and inclinations of 
 your readers; but certainly the idea of eating ducks 
 that have Been suffocated, is not the most pleasant. 

Fattening Ducks. — When the ducks are pretty fat 
 by the usual mode of feeding, they are shut up in 
 companies of eight in a dark place. Every morning 
 and evening, a servant puts their wings across, and 
 placing them between his knees, opens their bills 
 with his left hand, and with his right fills their craws 
 with boiled maize. They sometimes die from suffo- 
 cation; but they are not a bit the worse for it, provi- 
 ded care is taken to bleed them directly. The unfor- 
 tunate birds pass their fifteen days in a state of op- 
 pression and suffocation, which causes their livers to 
 enlarge, and keeps them always panting, and al- 
 most without breathing. When the tail of the duck 
 spreads out like a fan they know that it is fat enough_ 
 They are then turned out to bathe in clean water,af- 
 ter which they are killed. When the ducks thus 
 crammed have been picked, they seem balls of fat, 
 and none of their members are visible. S.

 Lime may exist in the soil, combined with the acid 
 that is the result of vegetable decomposition, and it 
 may also be combined with silex, and in either case, 
 it would not be capable of performing its proier of- 
 fice. 

As late as in 1850, we are told by Prof. J. T. W. 
 Johnston: "Lime acts in two ways upon the sjil. It 
 "produces a mechanical alteration which is simple 
 "and easily understood, and is the cause of a series 

"of chemical changes, which are really obscure, and 
 "are as yet susceptible of only partial explanation. 

"In the finely divided state of quick-lime or slack- 
 "edlime, or of soft and crumbling chalk, it stiffens 
 "very loose soils, and opens the stiffer clays ; while, 
 "in the form of limestone, gravel, or of shell sand, 
 "it may be employed either for opening a clay soil 
 "or for giving body and firmness to boggy land. These 
 "effects and their explanation are so obvious to you, 
 "that it is unnecessary to dwell upon them." 

To my mind, the chemical changes effected by 
 lim?, do not present any obscurity, and I contend 
 that they are susceptible of entire explanation. But 
 if we admit that it can effect all the mechanical 
 changes attributed to it by the learned author, I con- 
 fess that these effects and their explanation are not 
 so obvious to me ; but that they are really obscure. 

In considering the mechanical effects of lime on 
 our soil, we must keep constantly in view the small 
 amount usually applied to the acre, and the immense 
 amount of earth that this minute proportion of lime 
 is expected to act upon. If we apply fifty bushels 
 to the acre, which, at this time is considered a full 
 dose, let us calculate in what proportion the lime will 
 be as regards the soil. 

We have seen that an acre contains 43,560 feet, su- 
 perficial. If we divide this amount by 50, we have 
 871 feet for each bushel of lime. The small amount 
 that can be allotted out of one bushel to each of these 
 871 superficial feet, would render it almost impossi. 
 ble that any purely mechanical effect could be pro- 
 duood. But we have other authority for attributing 
 great mechanical effect to lime. Profeassr J. J. Mapes 
 lays it down with a degree of certainty truly aston- 
 ishing: the exact mechanical effect of lime on the 
 different soils. Whether the 'earned Professor has 
 imagined the existence of these phenomena, or wheth- 
 er he sees with microscopic eyes, I am unable to say, 
 but I have sometimes had it suggest itself to my mind, 
 that he was only following in the footsteps of some 
 illustrious predecessor, who wrote it down because he 
 thought it should be so. 

We are told by the learned Professor at page 227 
 of his December number for 1852 : "Some sandy 
 "soils are rendered more tenacious by the use of lime, 
 "particularly when accompanied by the addition of 
 "organic matter; others are injured by the applica- 
 "tlon of lime. When the ultimate particles of s.and 
 "are spherical, and they are often foundto be so when 
 "previously acted upon by water, slight rains lubri- 
 "cate these polished surfaces and cause the sand to 
 "pack. The addition of lime to such land, applied 
 "in the caustic form, roughens these surfaces, form- 
 "ing silicate of lime, and prevents the mechanical 
 .'condition before referred to. Some lands are mate- 
 "rially benefitted by the application of plaster, both 
 "from the .addition of its chemical constituents, and
