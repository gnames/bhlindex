In Dk. Harris's new edition of his treaties on Insects, 
 he gives the various modes resorted to in New Eng- 
 land and New York, to destroy them; a few of which 
 I will mention, as the best : Burn all the chaff where 
 they are to be found : plough the old grain fields with 
 a deep plough ; first sprinlcling the grotmd well with 
 lime. In those parts of New England where they 
 have done the greatest injury, the cultivation of fall 
 sown or winter grain has been given up: and this, 
 for some years to come, will be the safest course. 
 Late sowing has almost entirely b.anished the fly from 
 those parts of Vermont where they first appeared;and 
 there is good reason to believe that they will be starv- 
 ed out, when these means are generally adopted for a 
 few years. 

The above extracts have been taken from Harris;* 
 but they are only a small portion of his long paper; 
 yet all, perhaps, which are absolutely necessary for 
 farmers to know. I can assure them, however, that 
 they had better be up and doing; or they will sorely 
 repent their supineness. 

I will put these pupae in a glass jar with some 
 earth, and hope to raise some of the Flies; when, if 
 I succeed, I will send some in the perfect state to 
 you, that the enemy may be known face to face." 

Dr. Harris says, this insect seems to have been 
 long known in England; — as appears by an extract 
 of a letter ,written in 1771, and published in the Phi- 
 losophical Transactions for 1772. "The wheat fly is 
 said to have been first seen in America, about the 
 year 1828, f ii the northern part of Vermont, and on 
 the borders of Lower Canada. From these places 
 its ravages have gradually extended, in various direc- 
 tions, from year to year. A considerable part of 
 Upper Canada, of New York, New Hampshire, and 
 of Massachusetts have been visited by it; and, in 
 1834, it appeared in Maine, which it has traversed, 
 in an easterly course, at the rate of twenty or thirty 
 miles a year. The country over which it has spread 
 has continued to suffer more or less from its alarming 
 depredations,— the loss by which has been found to 
 vary from about one-tenth part to nearly the whole 
 of the annual crop of wheat; nor has the insect en- 
 tirely disappeared in any plsce, tiU it has been starv-

ed out by a change of agriculture, or by the substi- 
 tution of late-sown spring wheat for the other varie-

 West Chester, Penna., Feb. 7, 1853. 

Without a doubt the great preponderance of nox- 
 ious insects, is in some degree occasioned by the in- 
 discriminate destruction of birds. There are large 
 numbers of the feathered tribes that live almost ex- 
 clusively upon insects, and these should, under all 
 circumstances, receive the encouragement and pro- 
 tection of men. The Hirundinw, or swallow tribe, 
 particularly, are the most industrious and indefatiga- 
 ble little friends of mankind that, perhaps, belong to 
 that class of the animal kingdom. Several species of 
 them, too, are semi-domesticated, and prefer the hab- 
 itations provided by men, as places of shelter in 
 which to rear their young. The common chimney 
 swallow, (Acanthxjlis pelasgia,) the barn swallow, 
 (Ilirundo riifa,) and the purple or house martin, 
 {Progne purpurea,) are familiar,especially to farmers 
 a id villagers, if not to those who reside in larger 
 towns and cities. But their general usefulness, con- 
 nected with the destruction of insects, may, perhaps, 
 not have been so duly considered by those, even, who 
 have been wont to greet their coming every year, as 
 the harbinger of a more genial season. When it is 
 fully considered that these birds usually rear from 
 two to three broods of young before they take their 
 departure again in autumn; and that insects consti- 
 tute the entire food of the whole family, the impor- 
 tant office they perform in the economy of Nature,can 
 only be estimated and properly appreciated. Some 
 years ago I shot a chimney swallow as a specimen for 
 scientific preparation, that could not have been more 
 than an hour on the wing in the morning, when, on 
 opening its crop, I found that it contained over two 
 hundred of the smaller tribes of insects, principally 
 two-winged flies (Diptera). There are also other fami- 
 lies of birds that are partial to or live wholly upon in- 
 sects. The fly catchers, (Musicapidw) the warblers, 
 {Sylviadce)a.mongst the latter the industrious little wil- 
 low wren, [Sylvia trochihis) and also the Titmouses, 
 [Panis) the common Blue Bird, [Sialia Sialis) the 
 Oriole or Golden Robin, [Icterus Baltimore) and a 
 host of others that visit forests, orchards, and gar- 
 dens, in early spring when the trees are in bloom, for 
 the purpose of feeding upon the various species of 
 insects that are attracted thither by the odor and nec- 
 t:^r of the flowers, or for the purpose of depositing 
 their eggs in the opening calyx. AVhen it is known 
 that this is the time when the eggs are deposited that 
 produce tlie insects so injurious to cherries, plums, 
 pears, &c., it will also be seen of what service the 
 birds are to the trees and the fruit. Often when the 
 fruit is ripe there we certain species of birds that
