Guenon on Milch Cows. 
 The following communication is by one of our 
 readers, not a farmer, who has probably paid more 
 attention to this subject, and is better posted up than 
 any one in this section of country. He is often call- 
 ed on \ij farmers to buy their cows.

As your columns are open for the discussion of 
 any subject that will benefit the iarmers, I have 
 thought there was none at this time of any more im- 
 portance than raising stock ; and within this vicinity 
 than of good milk cows. I have owned Guenon's 
 theory for 3 or 4 years, and believe in it. But see- 
 ing a notice of another work coming out, simplifying 
 Guenon's theory, or making it plain to every reader, 
 I purchased a copy as soon as received at the Agri- 
 cultural Warehouse, and find many valuable sugges- 
 tions worthy of being remembered, and would rocom- 
 menl to every one having a Guenon, to have the 
 Treatise by John Nefflin confirming it. I may have 
 occasion to speak of this again, and, perhaps, give 
 my opinion upon it. But I say now, to every body 
 raising or keeping milk stock, to purchase it. They 
 will never regret the price paid for it : 30 cents.

Plan for Building a I.lme Kiln. 

Eaquiries having been addressed us as to the best 
 methol of constructing a lime kiln, we applied to 
 our friend, Jonathan C. Baldwin, formerly President 
 of the Chester county Horticultural Society,and whose 
 experienoe of many years on this subject, entitles 
 Ilia suggestions to as much weight as hi* well-known 
 skill in cultivating and testing choice fruit has esten- 
 ded his reputation as a pomologist. He writes as 
 follows : 

"My experienso of the best plan of constructing a 
 lime kiln for burning wholly with wood, is, in the 
 first place : select a suitable spot, a bank if practica- 
 ble, and excavate the foundation. Lay out the bot- 
 tom 7 feet by 0, the 9 feet extending from the eye 
 back. Then lay out the eye 10 inches wide, through 
 the breast, which should be 7 feet thick, and concave 
 in front, which greatly increases the strength. 

After the foundation is thus laid out, proceed with 
 the building, which should be double ; that is, build 
 your wall next the bank from 1 foot to 15 in. thick, 
 leaving about G or 8 inches short of the dimensions 

already given, which lining is to be built of s'ate or 
 soap-stone, 6 or eight inches long, or other stone that 
 will stand the fire. The advantage in this mode is, 
 that when any part of the kiln burns out, or the 
 whole, which it will do, it can be repaired without 
 pulling down the kiln. 

At the height of 12 feet from the bottom of the 
 kiln, place a pole directly over the centre of thekiln and 
 eye the longest way, (9 feet) whichmaybeasapling,the 
 heavy end being placed on the bank, and let it ex- 
 tend over the kiln at least 15 feet. Measure olF TJ 
 feet from the centre, each way. Lay another pole 
 across the kiln, crossing the former one at right an- 
 gles in the centre. Measure C feet each way from 
 the centre. You now have those poles 12 feet high 
 from the bottom, which is the height of the bulge. 
 Then drop lines from each end of the 15 feet mark, 
 down to each end of the 9 feet ; likewise from each 
 end of the 12 feet drop lines to each end of the 7 
 feet. You now have the pot of the kiln laid out 7 feet 
 by 9 at the bottom, and 12 by 15 at the bulge. The 
 mason will find a great advantage in th.se lines, ip 
 giving the kiln a true and regular slope. 

It is understood the shape ot the kiln is to be oval. 
 At this height lay out a bushel hole at the back part 
 of the kiln, for filling and emptying. It should be 
 3 foot wide at the pot, splaying out to 5 feet. The 
 kiln above the bulge, should be 3 J or 4 feet high, not 
 more, and, carried up straight. The pot and breast 
 should both be carried up at the same time. The eye 
 10 inches wide, should be carried up that width, 2 
 feet high in front, and 2 feet 5 inches inside. Next 
 the pot, forming an inclined plane, the top stones 
 should be large, as the^grates on which the wood is 
 thrown, rest on them. We then drop back, 4 inches 
 on each side, which increases the eye to 18 inches, 
 for the bushel to pass in and out. It is carried up 
 straight 20 inches, and then brought over to close. 
 The eye should not be built double, like the pot, but 
 of large slate or soap stones to stand the fire. In 
 describing the breast, I have said it should be 7 feet 
 thick, and a concave semi-circle of about 12 feet 
 radius. The wing should extend pretty well out, as 
 it strengthens the breast very much to top, which 
 should batter li inches to the foot from bottom. 
 There is no kiln so hard on the front, as those that 
 are burned wholly with wood. 

The kiln now being up, it is necesaary to have a 
 bench 6 or 8 inches thick, and 20 inches high inside 
 the pot for filling. 

A kiln aa above, will hold 1,000 to 1,100 bushels
