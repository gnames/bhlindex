Our New Volump. 

The present number closes the second volume o' 
 the Farm Journal. An index will accompany it,mak- 
 ing a volume, when bound, which we think our sub- 
 scribers will admit to contain much valuable matter, 
 and practical experiments and suggestions, far more 
 than remunerating them for the small price of sub- 
 scription. It is intended to issue the twelve numbers of 
 the new volume, within the present year, so as to make 
 it commence with the year, hereafter, which wo think 
 will be more convenient and satisfactory. Our ar- 
 rangements are such, that the volume now coming on 
 the first of next month, will be superior to .either of 
 the preceding, not only in the amount of reading mat^ 
 which has already been increased three or four pages, 
 but also, in the variety of topics of interest to the 
 farmer, which will be treated of. Illustrations will 
 accompany each number, consisting of original por- 
 traits of all kinds of stock, particularly of Pennsyl- 
 vania; new and improved implements, and machine- 
 ry, farm buildings, &o. The fruit department wil' 
 receive especial attention, and we hope to have en- 
 gravings of all our Pennsylvania seedling fruits wor" 
 thy of cultivation. Ornamental trees and shrubljery. 
 new and rare trees and plants, designing and laying 
 out grounds, the cultivation of flowers, &c., sliall all 
 receive their share of attention. We have facilities 
 for attending to these several branches, either our- 
 selves, or by the promised aid of our correspon- 
 dents, equal at least to any other agricultural Jour 
 nal. Our subscription list has been very considera" 
 bly increased since its removal to West Cheater, and 
 we hope for large additions to the new volume. Our 
 friends through the State, who think Pennsylvania 
 ought to have an agricultural paper, can greatly as- 
 sist us by getting up clubs in their respective neigh" 
 borhoods, and forwarding us the amount. Those 
 who wish to discontinue, and we hope there will be 
 but very few of this class, will please notify us before 
 the issue of next number. Bills will be sent with the 
 present number, which we shall be obliged by hav- 
 ing the amounts remitted to us, as they are too small 
 to admit of employing a collector.

George Walker's Premium Crop of Corn. 

The manuscript report of the above sent us from 
 Harrisburg, we find contains some errata, which 
 should bj corrected. Only two names were append- 
 ed to it, that of Judge Wm. Jessup being omitted. As 
 he was one of those who assisted in the measuring of 
 the corn and surveying the ground, and as his name, 
 so extensively known, affords in itself a sufficient 
 guarantee of the correctness of the report, it is prop- 
 er it should be added. 

There was an omission also in respect to the dis- 
 tance. It should read "in rows 3J feet apartj run- 
 ning north and south, and 3 feet apart in rows run. 
 ning east and west." "Workecf twenty six hills," 
 should read "husked t vonty sis hiUa." 

Wheat Bran as a Stimulant for Corn. 

"Would you think it, I have found ipheat bran a 
 greater stimulant for corn than Chemical Salts, or 
 Guano mixed with common salt, or mixed with Plas- 
 ter of Paris, or even of rich hog-pen manure, or well- 
 rotted summer cow-pen manure, and the corn nearly 
 or quite as good as the best of the above, which was 
 guano mixed with common salt, in the proportion of 
 200 lbs. to f bush, salt." L. W. Allen. 

Caroline co. Va., Jan. 6, 1853. 

We copy the above from the American Farmer, 
 Baltimore, which is, by the way, one of tho best ag- 
 ricultural papers in the country, and abounds, both 
 in its editorial, and original communications, with 
 really practical and valuable matter. 

The use of bran, as a "mineral food for the young 
 Indian corn plant," was brought to the notice of tho 
 readers of the Farm Journal, page 56, of present vol. 
 ume, by our able correspondent and sound agricultur- 
 al chemist,G. Blight Browne, of Montgomery county. 
 His whole article should be referred to at this time. 
 In it he says^"The bran, as soon as it has become 
 wet, will enter into decay, (eremacausis,) and car- 
 bonic acid will be formed and set free. Heat will be 
 evolved. The free carbonic acid will aid in dissolving 
 the mineral matter, and it will be taken up by the 
 roots of the plant. The root will soon extend over a lar- 
 ger surfaoe,and will be adequate to continue the sup- 
 ply without this artificial aid. Five bushels of bran by 
 double measure, will be sufBcient per acre, and tho 
 farmer will, if his land is in good order otherwise, 
 be generously repaid in the harvest time of his corn." 

Rhododeudrous and Kalmias. 

Rhododendron maximum, and Kalraia Latifolia 
 are two natives of Pennsylvania, unsurpassed in their 
 natural beauty and profuse blossoms on the sides and 
 tops of our mountains,by any thing we are acquainted 
 with.. They are always difiicult to transplant, 
 and flourish in open ground, or even in the shade, 
 which is a cause of general regret. It appears by 
 the following from David Thomas, of Aurora, and 
 which we copy from Warder's Horticultural Review, 
 that Lime even in small quantities is poisonous to 
 them, and that they cannot thrive where there is any 
 particle of it in the soil. 

We have before us an original letter frpm David 
 Thomas, a celebrated tree and fruit cuUurist in New 
 York, to a lady friend in Michigan, who is an enthus- 
 iastic cultivator of plants and flowers. In this letter 
 he recommends the soil taken -from the brink of a 
 ravine, where the lime has been leached out of it by 
 the rains. He has tried the soil with entire success. 
 Some peat earth may be mixed with it to advantage, 
 provided it be brought from a locality where limo 
 will not be likely to be mixed wit it. The soil where 
 they flourish in all their beauty in Pennsylvania, is 
 formed by the disintegration of graywacke rocks, in 
 which there is no lime. This peculiarity should al- 
 ways, we think, be regarded in the culture of these 
 plants. They should always be planted in the shade, 
 as they select shady woods for their habitat among 
 their native hills in Now York and Pennsylvania. If 
 any of our citizens wish to cultivate those boautifn 
 .plants.itwillcostthemvery little to try the esporimen'
