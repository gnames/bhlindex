CHOOSING MILCH COWS. 

March, 

As the subject is one of great practical importance 
 to the farmer, and no confidence in it can be created 
 by vague generalities or isolated assertions on the 
 part of those who may have given to it some atten- 
 tion, the Committe have endeavored by personal ob- 
 servation to verify the published statements. The 
 fortunate arrival in this country of a Gorman farmer, 
 Mr. Nefflin, has offered a most happy opportunity of 
 developing the nature and character of Guenon's ob- 
 servations, and the mode in which an adept in the sci- 
 ence proceeds in his examinations. More than forty 
 cows were examined by this gentleman in the pre- 
 sence ot the members of the Committee. All the re- 
 marks of Mr. Nefflin, all the questions and answers, 
 were taken down at the moment by Mr. Arthur Can- 
 non, phonographic reporter; and all his statements 
 were compared with those of the owners of the cows. 
 In this form and in this critical mode of proceeding, 
 the Committee thought it possible to remove every 
 doubt they themselves or others might feel in the 
 truth of the system, and be enabled to offer to the 
 Society and the Agricultural community a clear and 
 truthful history of this interesting discovery. After 
 a full and particular investigation, carried on in the 
 most searching manner, and sharpened by increduli- 
 ty, the Committee have no hesitation in giving their 
 adhesion, and expressing iheir concurrence in the 
 views of Guenon. The precision and accuracy with 
 which Mr. Nefflin rfessribes the qualities of the ani- 
 mals, and the unhesitating manner in which he re- 
 vealed all their properties, could not but impress the 
 Committee with an entire reliance on his own skill, 
 and a perfect confidence in the views of his teacher. 

Still, though the Committee have no hesitation in 
 offering this opinion, as the matter is one of the ut- 
 most importance, they deem it proper to recommend 
 that if there remain any doubt on the part of the So- 
 ciety, as to the clear and complete demonstration of 
 the truth of Guenon's observations, or if there are 
 individual members who hesitate to concede to the 
 point, the examinations should be continued until all 
 Bcepticism, as far as possible, be removed.

 The following certificates from Messrs. Ford and 
 Wilkinson, whoso cows were examined by Mr. Nef- 
 flin, are presented for the purpose of conveying to 
 the reader a clear idea of the method of examination, 
 and removing any doubts that might exist in regard 
 to the practical application of the theory by every 
 farmer. When it is remembered that Mr. Nefflin had 
 no prior knowledge of the character of the cows sub- 
 mitted to his inspection, (being an entire stranger in 
 the vicinity of Philadelphia), these testimonies from 
 gentlemen of the highest respectibility, furnish most 
 conclusive evidence of the value of the discove- 
 ry, and should at once commend it to the earnest at- 
 tention of the agricultural community generally. 
 MR. FORD'S STOCK. 
 ^IstCow. "Is a bastard of the 3d class, 2d order, 
 and is an excellently made cow; her milk is very 
 rich, of which she will yield IG qts., but she dried 
 suddenly after becoming pregnant." 

I certify the above is a correct report of the 
 qualities of the cow. 

Samuel C. Ford. 
 2d Cow. "Is a bastard of. the 3d class, 2d order, 
 and has no mark; will' calve about the 1st of March, 

a month prior to which time, she will suddenly de- 
 crease in her yield of milk; when not in a state of 
 pregnancy is a good milch cow." 

The same as regards this cow. 

Samuel C. Ford. 

3d Cow. "Is of the 4th class, 2d order, the escutch- 
 eon of the fork shape, though not so perfect as it 
 ought to be; will give 15 or 16 qts. of milk; about 5 / 
 or weeks after calving her yield is most plentiful; 
 her milk is very good." 

Correct in every respect. 

Samuel C. Ford. 
 MR. WILKINSON'S COWS. 

No. 1. Belongs to the 2d class, and 2d order, and 
 will yield from 16 to 18 qts. per day. She has not 
 the two oval marks distinct, or she would rank first 
 class. She will hold her milk up to the time of calT 
 ing. 

No. 2. "Belongs to the 2d order, and 1st class, and 
 would, if she were as large as No. 1, give 20 qts. of 
 milk per diem, but as it is, should give 15 or 16 qta. 

No. 3. "belongs to 2d class and 3d order." The 
 examiner here remarked that he supposed that Mr.W- 
 had been near 20 years in getting his herd to such 
 perfection, to which Mr. W. replied that he had not 
 owned a cow in his dairy more than two years and 
 three months, but that he had selected them on this 
 system. 

It is due to Mr. Wilkinson to say that the examin- 
 er, after he had examined all his cows, acknowledged 
 that in all his long experience with cows, he had not 
 in his whole life seen so large a number of such 
 highly marked cows in any herd, as he found in Mr. 
 W.'s herd of 8. Many other facts which must have 
 been highly gratfying to Mr. AV., were mentioned, 
 but are necessarily omitted. 

CERTIFICATE OF MR. WILKINSON. 

The description given of my cows by Mr. Nefflin, 
 after he exauined them by his improved Guenon sys- 
 tem, is in the main very correot,and satisfies me that 
 this is the only reliable system by which cows can ba 
 selected. John Wilkinson.

 THE CROSSING OF BREEDS. 

Crossing is the coupling of male and female ani 
 mals, provided with milk-marks from different clas- 
 ses or orders, as also of different races. 

This crossing produces two kinds of results ^7i- 
 imals, having similar inilk-marka, hut from different 
 races, particularly tohen the male belongs to a better 
 race, maij he coupled without injury to the yield of ths 
 milk. But crosses between different classes always 
 produce unfavorable results, and more so when the 
 bull belongs to an inferior order, or even to an infe- 
 rior class. 

Such pairing of the sexes will reduce the breed to 
 a lower class or order; it may even cause a great dis- 
 figuration in the milk-mirror, and make a classifica- 
 tion impossible, when, as a matter of course, it be- 
 comes impracticable to ascertain the order to which 
 the animal belongs. 

Advantages can only be obtained by the crossing of 
 different breeds or races, when the mirrors of both 
 animals correspond, or still better, when the mirro? 
 of the male belongs to a higher order. 

If however the object of crossing is to obtain ahea^ 
 vier stock of cattle, it is advisable rather to procure 
 a male animal, which of course must bo provided with 
 the corresponding railk-iaarks. By this means the 
 object of the crossing will be obtained sooner than 
 by the purchase ol a cow. Nefflin's Treatise.
