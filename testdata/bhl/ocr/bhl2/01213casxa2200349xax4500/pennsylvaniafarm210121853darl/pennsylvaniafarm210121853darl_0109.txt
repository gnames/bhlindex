them during winter. Tulips, hyacinths and all other 
 hardy bulbs may be planted early this month. Trim 
 and replant box-edging. Manure and dig flower 
 beds. Sweep clean and roll well lawns and grass 
 plats. Laying sod should be attended to this month. 
 Clean and roll gravel walks, and make everything 
 look neat and clean. 

Now is the time to raise annuals from seed for early 
 blooming. For a selection of varieties, and the 
 method of raising them, we would refer to an article 
 published in the Journal of last month. Plants in 
 windows which have done blooming, should be re- 
 moved to a cooler place, and their shoots shortened 
 considerably. Plants in cellars should have air ad- 
 mitted to them freely in mild weather, and be water- 
 ed more liberally than during winter.

The Agricultural Society met at 9 o'clock this

 bout 100 members were present. Various commit- 
 tees reported an amendment to the Constitution, 
 changing the time of the annual meeting, to the last 
 Wednesday of February, which was adopted.

 reduce the terms of admission, and annual subscrip- 
 tion members. This was debated and rejected.

 members; — President Fillmore, Gen. Pierc3, Samuel 
 Appleton, Thomas H. Perkins, Bobert G. Shaw, Ed-

 gress to establish a department of Agriculture, was 
 taken up.

 this great interest, embracing four-fifths of our popu- 
 lation, should be represented in the cabinet councils

 of Philadelphia, and arguing that the analysis of soils 
 in the present state of Chemistry, is of no immediate 
 practical value to the farmer.
