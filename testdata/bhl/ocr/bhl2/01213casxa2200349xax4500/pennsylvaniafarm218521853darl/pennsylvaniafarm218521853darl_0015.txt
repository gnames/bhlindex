Tor thus to supply the deficient element or substance. 
 Occasionally also we meet with a soil in which, 
 though it has been well manured, the crop cultivated 
 fails to thrive. The cause of this is to be found chiefly 
 in the fact that the soil is deficient in certain sub- 
 stances which the manure used was not calculated to 
 supply in adequate quantity. 

If the principles here indicated be applied with 
 judgment and care, larger crops may be produced, 
 at much less cost, than can be efiected by the use of 
 barnyard manure alone, if we are but careful to ob- 
 serve, in the first place, whether the soil has not, on 
 the whole, been already exhausted and^rendered in- 
 capable of supporting vegetation; and, secondly, 
 whether it is likely that it contains the particular 
 substances of which the crop designed to be cultiva- 
 ted requires larger supplies. This can be ascertained 
 accurately only by a chemical analysis of the soil; 
 though there are certain characteristics and indica- 
 tions enabling us to judge whether the soil contains 
 the required substances or not. "With due regard to 
 these indications and probabilities, we shall now pro- 
 ceed to notice the principal crops cultivated, and the 
 elements they contain and require. 

1. Tobacco. In this plant the combustible elements 
 decidedly predominate. Besides carbon, hydrogen, 
 and oxygen, tobacco contains also a considerable quan- 
 tity of nitrogen, which is found in it in the form of 
 ammonia. But among its components are also pot- 
 ash and lime, less phosphoric acid, and very little of 
 the remaining incombustible elements. Hence it 
 would seem to be most advantageous to cultivate to- 
 bacco on land dressed with fresh barnyard manure, 
 so that the ammonia may be absorbed as it is devel- 
 oped. But as nitrogen and potash are specially im- 
 portant constituents of this plant, it can be profitably 
 cultivated without barnyard manure, if the soil be 
 not totally exhausted but contain the requisite sub- 
 stances for the production of carbon ; and instead of 
 dung, we may employ nitrogenous substances, such as 
 horn shavings, malt sprouts, hair, &c. If tobacco ab- 
 sorb too much ammonia, its perfect development will 
 be prevented, which is the case accordingly when 
 horse dung has been used, and the state of the weath- 
 er was favorable to the production of ammonia. As 
 tobacco requires and absorbs but little phosphoric 
 acid, it may properly be followed in rotation by a 
 crop of winter grain. 

2. Potatoes. Among the combustible elements 
 contained in this vegetable, the carbonaceous matters 
 (starch) predominates greatly over the nitrogenous 
 (gluten), though the latter are never wanting. If by 
 the use of strong nitrogenous manures, the nitrogen- 
 ous matters become predominant, the tubers willcon- 
 tain mucilage and gluten instead of starch, and thus 
 become watery and unserviceable. Of the incombus- 
 tible elements, the potato contains potash, ]ime, sili- 
 cic acid and sulphur, with but a small quantity of 

phosphoric acid. Judging from these ingredients, 
 the potato should be cultivated in soils containing a 
 large amount of matter suited for the production of 
 carbon, and but little of such as is fitted for the pro- 
 duction of nitrogen. It should, therefore, not be 
 grown on land recently dressed with fresh barnyard 
 manure, and least of all in such as has just been ma- 
 nured with horsedung. It succeeds best after clover. 
 "Wood ashes may also be employed with good results 
 where we have reason to suspect that the potash of 
 soil has been in great part consumed by the preced- 
 ing crops. As the potato requires much potash and 
 carbon, it is not a suitable precurser of wither grain, 
 and where circumstances require that fresh barnyard 
 manure should be used for this crop, it should be plow- 
 ed in in the preceding autumn, 

3. Beets. The predominant elements of beets are 
 mainly carbonaceous, consisting of sugar, mucilage, 
 &c. The nitrogenous elements are greatly subordi- 
 nate. Of the incombustible substances the more im- 
 portant are potash, soda and lime ; though phospho- 
 rus, sulphuric acid, and muriate of soda or common 
 salt are also found in not inconsiderable quantity. — 
 Such being the composition of the sugar beet, it is 
 accordingly to be cultivated in land containing much 
 old or well ripened humus and only a small propor- 
 tion of nitrogenous ingredients. On freshly manured 
 land the composition of the beets produced is very 
 different. In such the nitrogenous elements predo- 
 minate, and instead of saccharine matter, saltpetre 
 and ammoniacal combinations are produced. Now, as 
 nitrocrenous elements are more nutritious than such 
 as are mainly carbonaceous, it follows that beets in- 
 tended to be fed to cattle should be grown on land 
 containing large quantities of nitrogenous substances, 
 such as are supplied by fresh barnyard manure. — 
 Moreover, as beets require much phosphoric acid 
 and potash, they are a very unsuitable crop to pre- 
 cede a cereal grain. 

4. Rape. Oil consists mainly of carbon, hydrogen, 
 and oxygen, which substances can readily be supplied 
 to the soil by manuring with the ordinary barnyard 
 manure. But the seeds and husks or hulls contain 
 many nitrogenous elements, such as phrsphoric acid, 
 sulphur, &c.; whilst the ashes of the straw or haulm 
 consist chiefly of potash, some lime, soda, and sul- 
 phuric acid, with a small proportion of phosphoric 
 acid. It is hence apparent that besides carbon and 
 niirogcn,- Rape requires many of the incombustible 
 elements, and that consequently this crop demands 
 liberal manuring and repeated plowing to transform 
 the fixed elements which the soil contains into a suit- 
 able soluble state. As Rape ta.kes up but little phos- 
 phoric acid, it is a suitable ci'op to precede winter 
 "•rain. And since its ashes show that it requires 
 much lime and sulphur, and as it elaborates itsnitro- 
 "■cnous constituents out of ammonia, it is advisable to 
 give the land on which it is to be grown a dressing 
 of gypsum, if deficient iii calcareous matter.
