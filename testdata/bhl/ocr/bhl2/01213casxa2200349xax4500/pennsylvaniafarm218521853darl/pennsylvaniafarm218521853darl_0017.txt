In conclusion, permit me to say, that lime and good 
 stable manure will enrich almost any land if proper-

 ed in sufficient abundance, clover or other green 
 crops (with a top-dressing of gypsum or plaster of 
 paris) plowed doivn, will be found important adjuncts.

 Curing of Corn Fodder~Cutting for food. 

Mr. Editor : — The January No. of your Journal 
 contains an article on this subject, by R. Mansfield ; 
 which induces me to give my humble opinion on the 
 same subject, although I may diifer somewhat from 
 that gentleman in the method I pursue. 

My custom is, to cut the corn and fodder close to 
 the ground, and shock it against three or four stalks 
 left standing, and tied together with a few blados or 
 a little straw as a support. When the shock is large 
 enough, (which may be from 36 to 48 hills) it is well 
 tied with a good band of long straw. Thus the 
 shocks are well secured from the efiects of the storms, 
 which might otherwise blow them to the ground. — 
 The tops are kept close.which prevents the rain from 
 penetrating them, and the juicy butts are set suffi- 
 ciently wide apart to admit a free circulation of air 
 to dry the fodder. In this condition it is left till 
 husking time, when the corn and fodder are separa- 
 ted. The fodder is then tied into bundles, and when 
 perfectly dry, is taken to the barn or shed and mowed 
 in the following order : The first covering is, to set 
 the bundles upright, the butts on the floor ; and the 
 second is laid down flat, like grain, to prevent break- 
 ing in while at work ; the third is set on end like the 
 first, and so on. This is to keep it loose, and admit 
 air to prevent the fodder from becoming musty; which 
 cannot well be prevented when all is laid down flat 
 in the mow. It is a well known fact, that corn fod- 
 der cannot be left in the field till the saccharine juice 
 of every stalk is dried up, without injuring the fod- 
 der materially. But by my way of mowing, the in- 
 jury it may suffer by standing too long in the field, 
 as well as becoming musty in the mow, is prevented. 
 I am now ready to begin feeding, which is done 
 ■when cut fine. I have a cutter and crusher, (manu- 
 factured by E. Potts, A^alley Forge, Chester county,) 
 which I attach to the horse-power. With this ma- 
 chine I can cut and crush from 150 to 200 bushels 
 in an hour. This makes the hard stalks almost as 
 tender and manageable as the blades, and there is no 
 difficulty in feeding. Cattle eat it very readily in 
 this state, and when mixed with meal and scalded or 
 steamcd,^it is excellent for milk cows, or for fattening 
 cattle. One ton fed in this way will feed more cat-

 Profits of Keeping Fowls. 

Mr. Editor : — As the fowl mania appears to have 
 been prevalent in some parts of the country for a few 
 years past, and having seen some very exaggerated 
 statements, in regard to the large profits to be de- 
 rived from keeping a large stock of hens for laj'ing, 
 raising chickens, &c., and on the contrary, having 
 heard it positively asserted by many of my neighbors 
 that a hen, if well fed, will consume in a year, grain 
 or other food worth more than double the value of 
 the eggs she will produce in that time ; I determined 
 to ascertain whether any or either of these statements 
 were correct. 

I accordingly commenced operations on the fiist 
 day of January, 1850, by selecting seventeen hens 
 and one cock from our other stock of fowls — they 
 were a mixture of Jersey Blues and common breeds, 
 and were considered in these parts good layers and of 
 large size — the hens weighing 5^ to 7 lbs. each, and 
 the cock 10 lbs. I appropriated part of an unoccu- 
 pied frame building for their use, put up suitable fix- 
 tures for them to roost on, and sundry boxes and old 
 flour casks laid on their sides, with a little hay or 
 straw in them for nests to lay in. The door of this 
 building opened into an adjoining yard of about 25 
 feet square, and was kept open night and day in 
 summer, but shut every night in winter, and if very 
 stormy or cold weather it was only left open about 
 five or six hours daily. There was also a lot of ground 
 adjoining the yard, containing about a quarter of an 
 acre, occupied as a nursery of young fruit trees two 
 years old from the graft, surrounded by a good board 
 fence; through both of which, yard and nursery, the 
 fowls were permitted to roam at pleasure, the feath- 
 ers of one wing of each being cut to prevent them 
 from escaping. They were fed regularly, morning 
 and evening, principally with corn or corn meal, oc- 
 casionally mixed with wheat, bran or shorts, and a 
 few boiled onions, and some refuse meat from a butch- 
 er's shop. I ascertained by actual measurement that 
 the quantity of corn or its equivalent of other food 
 consumed, daily in the fall and winter, half of the 
 year, was three quarts, and in the spring and summer 
 half, (young chickens and all included) or but little 
 over half that quantity. The whole quantity of food 
 consumed throughout the year was equal to 27 bush- 
 els of corn, worth here, at market price, 45 cents per 
 bushel (part of the time corn sold for 40 cents and a 
 part of the year for 50 cents.) The number of eggs 
 were set down immediately when brought in, but as 
 we were not particular to mark down dates, I can 
 only give the aggregate for this 3'ear. I find on add- 
 ing up the account, we obtained 1308 eggs which
