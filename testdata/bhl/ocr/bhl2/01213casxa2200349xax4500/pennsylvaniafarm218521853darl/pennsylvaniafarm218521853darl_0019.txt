and the sulphuric acid. The carbonic acid escapes, 
 but unless we have present an excess of sulphuric 
 acid, which is seldom the case, the sulphurous acid 
 will combine with the lime and form a salt, whose ef- 
 fect is positively injurious to the growing plant, ow- 
 ing to its avidity for oxygen. It operates injuriously 
 in much the same manner as protoxide of iron. In 
 any event, we obtain no benefit from the presence of 
 the organic matter, as when we have dissolved the 
 bones in the acid, nothing remains of it ; and we have 
 suffered considerable loss of acid. 

If, therefore, we dissolve the bone after it is burnt, 
 we afford to the plant phosphate of lime in the most 
 divided state, and at the cheapest rate possible. — 
 However, it is not necessary that we should use suf- 
 ficient acid to render the whole mass liquid, and un- 
 less the dose applied be very small, I would prefer 
 the use of about 20Ib of acid to the lOOIb of bones 
 (before burnt). If the acid is diluted with four times 
 its own weight of water, by the addition of sawdust, 
 it can be dried so as to be easily handled, and the 
 moisture of the ground will sufficiently dissolve it. — 
 Two hundred pounds per acre of bones, thus pre- 
 pared, will form a sufficient dose, if applied in the 
 hill. It should be put on at the planting. 

I have lately seen several notices of a mineral, al- 
 ledged to be a native phosphate of lime, and said to 
 be found in Morris county. New Jersey, at or near 
 the Zinc mines. It was reported in the Germantown 
 Telegraph lately, as having been referred to, by some 
 gentleman of the Farmers' Club, of Philadelphia co., 
 as a valuable substitute for bones, and was to be had 
 for $12 per ton. On application to C. B. Rodgers, 
 of 29 Market street, where almost any thing useful 
 in agriculture can be had as soon as it makes its ap- 
 pearance, I procured some specimens. I have not 
 analyzed them, but from their appearance, have no 
 confidence in their containing any considerable quan- 
 tity of any phosphate, and am sure that they do not 
 contain anything like enough to bring them up to 
 Prof. Mapes' analysis, as published in Mr. Skinner's 
 periodical some time since. 

One large source, from which agriculture might re- 
 claim large quantities of phosphoric acid, has always 
 been overlooked by the manufacturers of Ilydro-feno- 
 cyanite of potash. The mother watei'S of this salt, 
 contain large quantities of phosphate of potash. It is 
 very soluble, and combines all that would be neces- 
 sary to furnish both phosphoric acid and potash to 
 the plant.* 

But when we have applied this prepared bonedust, 
 if the soil is destitute, or even scantily supplied with 
 the other mineral requirements, or does not contain 
 sufficient humus, we will not realize our expectations.

its supply. This 2-100 when analyzed is found to 
 consist of 

Sul: acid, 0.5

Lime, 0.1 

Magnesia, 17.5 

Potash, 23.2 

Soda, 3.8 

Iron, 0.1 

The next question is, how are 'these substances to be 
 supplied, when deficient ? I take it for granted, that 
 as they are found in all specimens of corn, that no 
 man will dispute that corn cannot existwithout them. 
 If by any accident we were to produce corn without 
 any or either of them, the effect would be, that it 
 would no longer subserve our purpose, and that the 
 stock fed on such corn, would, like the dog fed on 
 white bread, pine away and die. It would become a 
 useless substance for that purpose, and would soon 
 fall into disuse. 

Sulphuric acid and the phosphates we have al- 
 ready. Magnesia is furnished by the Schy. lime, 
 which consists of 

Lime, 35.00 

Magnesia, 40.54 

Clay and iron, 7.60 

Sand, 4.00 

AVator, 12.80 

Chlorine and soda are furnished in the shape of 
 common salt, by the sea winds. Iron generally pre- 
 vails in the soil. Potash has generally been supplied 
 from wood ashes. This substance can be furnished 
 to the soil at much cheaper rates by using the sul- 
 phate of potash, which can be had at Rodger's, No. 
 29 Rlarket street, or at Powers & "Weightman's, at 
 low rates. This latter, to a certain extent, will sup- 
 ply the place of plaster.

Mr. Editor : I promised some time ago to send you 
 an article on raising Corn, and in accordance with 
 that promise have hastily penned the following, 
 which is at your service : 

For the last six years I have been experimenting* 
 for the purpose of ascertaining the best mode of 
 growing corn, that one great error into which our 
 farmers fiill, is that of planting too close ; from three 
 feet to three feet six inches being the distance unu- 
 sually allowed between the rows each way. My 
 plan is to score out my rows from north to southj 
 leaving a space of full four feet between each. I
