then drop two grains at one place, with an interval 
 of two feet and a half between each dropping. My 
 object in scoring out north and south, is to give eve- 
 ry hill or stalk the benefit of as much sun as possi- 
 ble, and to prevent in a certain degree one row from 
 shading another. Corn, like snakes, is fond of the 
 sun. Every hill is covered with the hoe, (preferring 
 the good old way in that respect to any other) taking 
 good care that no stones or clods rest upon the place 
 where the corn has been planted. This can be ac- 
 com-plished in no way so well as with the hoe. 

My time for planting is generally between the 10th 
 and 15tli of May, giving the ground a chance to be- 
 come well warmed before the seed is put into it. — 
 There is far less danger of t'lC corn rotting, when 
 the ground is warm, and the rapidity of its growth 
 more than compensates for the lateness of the sea- 
 son; besides, it is r.ot near so liable to a back set 
 as when it is planted earlier. Many farmers plant 
 their corn the last week in April, when the ground 
 is wet and cold, and as a consequence, (unless under 
 very favorable circumstances) it \a.js there for weeks 
 without germinating, and very frequently rots. I 
 have known corn to remain in the ground for three 
 weeks before it made its appearance above ground, 
 while it is seldom that corn planted from the 10th to 
 the 15th of May, does not sprout in three or four 
 days. It may be proper to remark here, that I al 
 ways soak my seed corn in hen manure water, be- 
 fore planting. 

I prefer my mode of planting to the drilling sys- 
 tem, as the corn is less difficult to keep clean, and I 
 find that I can raise just as much as by the other 
 plan. I have raised from 75 to 80 bushels per acre, 
 without extra manuring, which I consider a fair 
 yield. 

Last season, I tried an experiment upon ten aci-es, 
 by planting one half full 4 feet apart, two grains at 
 a place, 2^ feet apart. The other half was drilled 
 in, 4 feet apart. The drilled portion was much more 
 difficult to keep clean than the other, and the yield 
 was about the same. The corn on the 5 acres plant- 
 ed according to my favorite method, that is full four 
 feet, between the rows, and 2^ feet between the dropp- 
 ings, was much the finest, being larger and fuller in 
 the ear, and easier husked. 

I should have mentioned in the beginning of this 
 article, that my ground intended for corn, is always 
 put in the very best condition before planting. Spring 
 ploAving is, I think, much to be preferred for corn ; 
 unless the land is too rich, which is not often the 
 case. In concluding this plain statement, I will mere- 
 ly remark, that if the same attention were paid to 
 corn growing, that is given to the raising of wheat — 
 if the land was as well manured and worked, we 
 could as easily raise one hundred bushels to the acre, 
 as we now raise fifty.

 Geology applied to Agrlculture—No. 1. 

A knowledge of the geological structure and com- 
 position of the earth is necessary to the agriculturist 
 who would enjoy the advantages that Nature has 
 treasured up for his use. With the hope of directing 
 the attention of farmers to a subject of such A'ital im- 
 portance to them, I shall endeavor to collect together 
 and arrange in a simple and intelligible form, some 
 of the leading facts and principles, abounding in the 
 works of geologists, and such as have a particular 
 bearing on the science of agriculture. 

Geology is a comprehensive science, embracing in- 
 quiries into the structure, form and properties ol the 
 animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms of nature. 
 To pursue the entire study of this science and com- 
 prehend fully all its departments, presupposes a 
 knowledge of many kindred branches, such as miner- 
 alogy, chemistry, botany, conchology which could 
 not be expected in the majority of practical agricul- 
 turists. 

Should I, however, induce some of your readers by 
 investigation and study to apply the knowledge which 
 geology imparts, to the cultivation and improvement 
 of the soil, my purpose will be accomplished. 

The crust of the earth has been penetrated by man 
 or is exposed to view in various locations to the ag- 
 gregate depth of some ten miles* — thus, while the 
 semi-diameter of our globe is 4000 miles, man has 
 only been able to penetrate or examine a four-hund- 
 reth part of its depth. 

Although this proportion as compared with the 
 whole mass is quite small, the actual thickness is far 
 greater than we eould explore with any means at our 
 command, were it not that a benignant Providence 
 had accomplished the work for us. 

The upheavel of mountains ; the depression of val- 
 leys ; the excavation of rivers ; the disturbing force 
 of earthquakes, volcanoes &c., by their united action 
 have exposed to view as before stated, ten miles or more 
 in depth of the earth's crust ; but the same materials 
 are not found everywhere. The denuding, changing, 
 and recomposing action of fire, water, and air, or the 
 atmosphere, have in many places entirely removed 
 what was once the upper surface and exposed to view 
 the lower or deeper formation, while in other places 
 new deposits have been made which differ entirely 
 from those that were removed as also from the harder 
 formations or substrata which remain. 

The great changes that have by these various means 
 been effected on the surface of the earth, give us 
 every description of soil from entirely silicious and 
 barren to that which abounds in fertilizing properties 
 both vegetable and mineral. 

The figure below will illustrate the manner in 
 in which the crust of the earth for a considerable 

*Many estimates make the depth much greater.
