the intention of killing them on the passage ; but after 
 wards he concluded to bring them home. The buck 
 vra,9 purchased by my father and Cheyney Jefferies 
 at $40. This was previous to 1815. In those days 
 Cheyney was a very noted sheep feeder, though he 
 bred but few. He always purchased the wether 
 lambs that we had to spare at $2,50 per head and as 
 uniformly fed and sold them at from $8 to $12 per 
 head when from two to three years old ; and I pre- 
 sume there may be still some relic of this stock in 
 Pcale's Museum, Philadelphia. Since then, I have 
 bred some good Leicesters, and mixed bloods, one of 
 which was a ewe that I had bred from for ten years. 
 She was fed by Jonathan Gheen, of Goshen, Chester 
 county, killed in Wilmington, and weighed, when 
 dressed 144 lbs., and was sold at fifty cents per lb. 
 J. G. used to show a hickory peg five inches long 
 which he said was the thickness of fat on her ribs. 
 The Leicesters I found to be the tenderest and most 
 difficult to raise, and having early remarked that the 
 smutty or dark-faced sheep were generally more har- 
 dy than white faced ones. When the South Downs 
 were introduced, I was soon induced to give them the 
 preference. Having a large family to provide for, I 
 found their wool much better adapted to the manu- 
 facture of satinetts, &c., than any other that I had 
 owned ; the quality being considered equal to half 
 blood Merino. Feeling desirous of improving some 
 of the best South Downs, as the few in our county 
 could not be bought at less than $50 per head, and 
 not first-rate at that. 

In 1839, 1 visited the land of South Downs and pro- 
 cured some of J. EUman. The prices that I paid him 
 were $150 for one buck and $50 for two ewes, and in 
 order to be able to breed the stock longer without de- 
 generating, I then purchased four ewes of Stephen 
 Grantham (steward to Earl of Liverpool,) for which 
 I paid $100. Those exhibited by me at the late show 
 were all bred by me. The seven head that I import- 
 ed, cost over $400 when landed at Philadelphia, ex- 
 clusive of the cost of water casks, feed, &c., &c. — 
 And now, after manifesting this much spirit, I hope 
 to be excused for saying with Burns, that I do not 
 like "to see how things are shared," and if friend R. 
 H. Powell would not do me the credit to make it 
 known that I bred his buck that took the first pre- 
 mium, and also two of his best ewes that also took 
 the first premium, I shall claim the privilege of mak- 
 ing it known myself. I should think that when the 
 owner receives the profit of a good animal, the breed- 
 er is always justly entitled to some credit ; and I 
 fancy it would be gratifying to purchasers to know 
 who bred them. 

Is it not a fact too obvious to be denied, that our 
 markets are more poorly supplied with good sheep than 
 any other kind of stock. Our beef and pork are good ; 
 but what can be said of the mutton of thousands of 
 those "landpike" bleaters that are killed merely for 

the skins. If I were to judge for the benefit of the 
 community (as well as for myself,) I should say that 
 there should be greater inducements held out to the 
 breeders of good sheep than for that of any other kind 
 of stock ; and I will venture to assert that if all the 
 sheep that Pennsylvania and Ohio send to Philadel- 
 phia in one year were only lialf blood South Downs, 
 that the breeders of them would realize thousands of 
 dollars more than they now do. I would not have it 
 thought that my object is to court buyers, for I have 
 none for sale at this time, and I have not sold a Ewe 
 since I imported my present ^stock, to any person in 
 this State, except J. H. Powell, and my near neighbor 
 John Worth, Jr., who, by the by, as I have mention- 
 ed his name, I may add was the breeder of those fine 
 twin wethers, that were fed by B. Hood, and killed 
 last winter in Philadelphia. Our friend A. Clement, 
 in his communication in the 6th No. of the Farm 
 Journal, emitted to state when he mentioned the age 
 of the heaviest one (which was 234 lbs.) that it was 
 one year older than the twins that weighed 202 and 
 192 lbs. This I mention for the credit of the Downs. 
 They were J bloods. But I may say J. W. jr., has 
 for some years declined breeding any Sheep except 
 Downs, and I have sold him more ewes than I have 
 sold to all others since 1839, and found him to be the 
 most liberal buyer in our State that I have dealt 
 with, except A. Clement, of Philadelphia ; and to 
 him I would recommend those who are not judges of 
 stock themselves, or do not find it convenient to at- 
 tend to purchasing for themselves. 

I shall now add a few lines from an English work 
 of some seven hundred pages, on the difierent breeds 
 of Sheep — by Wm. Youatt. He says, page 111, "The 
 South Down is adapted to almost any situation in the 
 midland part of England. It has a patience of occa- 
 sional shortkeep, and an endurance of hard stocking, 
 equal to any other Sheep, an early maturity, 
 scarcely inferior to that of the Leicester's and the 
 flesh finely grained and of a peculiarly good flavor." 
 Page 235, he says — "the number of South Down 
 Sheep sent for the supply of the London market has 
 for many years been regularly increasing ; and while 
 the quality of the flesh pleases the customer, they are 
 generally admitted to be the best proof Sheep that are 
 brought to Smithfield. The average dead weight of 
 the South Down wethers vary from 8 to 11 stones. 
 But Mr. Grantham exhibited a pen of three sheep at 
 the last show of the Smithfield Club (1835,) one of 
 them weighing 20 stones 3 lbs ; the second 20 stones 
 6 lbs., and the third 21 stones." Page 237, he says, 
 " the practice of letting and selling Rams was more 
 prevalent and more profitable among the breeders 
 of South Down Sheep than of any other kind, except 
 the Leicesters. At the sheep shearing at Woburn, in 
 1800, a South Down Ram belonging to the Duke of 
 Bedford, was let for one season at 80 Guineas, two 
 others at 40 each, and four more at 28 guineas each.
