MR. GOWEN'S ADDRESS.

graciously responded to by almost every county in 
 the State, and by none more cordially than Lancas- 
 ter. Her broad shoulders were put Tvith a will to 
 the machine, which was soon seen to move and roll 
 onward to Harrisburg, the centre of the State, where 
 last January it was dedicated to the work of Agri- 
 cultural progress. Your share, gentlemen, in this 
 achievement, was in every respect worthy of your 
 noble county; and your Society, which I now have 
 the honor to address, exhibits a striking evidence of 
 the de ermination of Lancaster to pgrsevere in the 
 great undertaking, and furnishes a guarantee that so 
 far as it depends upon her, the work of progress will 
 be carried on with zeal and fidelity. I repeat, that 
 I ever thought that no State Agricultural Society 
 could be effected until Lancaster moved in the mat- 
 ter ; and it is equally clear to my convictions, that 
 80 far as Eastern Pennsylvania is concerned, the 
 State Society must languish, unless Lancaster, 
 through its Agricultural Society, lends to it the com- 
 manding influence of its name and energies. This 
 must be conceded, I think, by all who ai-e conversant 
 with her position and character as a farming district. 
 The relation she bears to York, Cumberland, Dau- 
 phin and Berks, through associations of maternity 
 and filial regard, cannot but render her action of the 
 utmost importance. Her supineness, hitherto, was 
 held by many in other sections as excuse for holding 
 back, while she stood still. This was cause of regret 
 to several of her own cherished citizens, among them 
 the venerated Redmond CoNYNGHAM,who correspond- 
 ed with me, and who has been translated from an 
 earthly* to a heavenly Paradise, to receive the re- 
 ward of his many virtues. If he were living, how it 
 would rejoice him to witness the scene in which we 
 are now permitted to participate. He, with many 
 of his venerable cotemporaries, has been gathered to 
 the great Harvest Hume where we all must be garner- 
 ed ; but Lancaster still, as ever, abounds with laborers 
 capable of carrying on the good work. Any county 
 of the State may be challenged to present a greater 
 array of gifted minds than Lancaster can point to 
 among her citizens — men capable of filling every sta- 
 tion in which talent, patriotism, and sterling worth 
 are deemed prerequisites. Surely, then, it will not 
 be asking too much of them, to lend the influence of 
 their names to the cause in which we are embarked. 
 Most of them have been brought up on farms, or 
 have in youth mingled in the scenes of rural life, and 
 it cannot be but their youthlul recollections, as well 
 as a just appreciation of the labors of the husband- 
 man, will incline them to join with you in redeeming 
 the time, and in placing the agriculture of your coun- 
 ty in fact, where it ever was supposed to be, in the 
 first rank. And here perftiit me to say, that so far 
 as regards the prosperity of your Society, and the 
 advancement of the interests it was instituted to pro- 
 mote, it should bo your aim to invoke the aid and 
 countenance of such men. I allude to gentlemen of 
 the learned professions, and other intelligent and in- 
 fluential citizens, not specially engaged in farmin"-. 
 The great body of farmers, those whose sphere of 
 action is circumscribed within the limits of the fields 
 they cultivate, however naturally strong in good 
 sense and understanding, are, from their habits of 
 quiet and seclusion, averse to placing themselves in 
 stations, even in an Agricultural Society, which 
 might demand the exhibition of capabilities commen- 
 surate with the duties of the places their associates 
 would gladly see them fill. Hence, if the founding 
 society were to depend upon the 

and conducting a

farmers themselves, few Agricultural Societies would 
 be formed or carried on with the zeal, tact and ener- 
 gy necessary to their progress and usefulness ; and 
 this must be apparent to every observer who has had 
 the opportunity of acquainting himself with the re- 
 tiring habits of the tillers of the soil. Therefore, it 
 is not only expedient, but indispensable to the ad- 
 vancement of the cause, that Agricultural Societies 
 should rank among their members men respectable 
 and distinguished of whatever profession. It needs 
 no argument to demonstrate the advantages to be de- 
 rived from the co-operation of such men. 

To illustrate, however;' the benefits that have been 
 conferred upon Agriculture by the .abors of profes- 
 sional gentlemen, I need but referto the Philadelphia 
 Society, and its successful career through a period 
 of nearly seventy years. Its presiding officers, ihr 
 the greater part of that time, were the distinguished 
 and talented Judge Peters and Nicholas Biddle; and 
 I may safely say, that it was owing to their labors 
 and influences, with other respectable citizens not 
 farmers, that gave to that Agricultural Society such 
 celebrity. To this day it exhibits on its list of mem- 
 bers individuals of the medical and legal professions, 
 and of tho commercial communit}', who prove them- 
 selves zealous and useful members. It jhould, how- 
 ever, be remarked, that the great bulk of the Society 
 at all times was made up of those owning and livin" 
 upon farms. 

The aid rendered by literary and professional men 
 in carrying out the design of the Society, was not 
 the only benefit growing out of the association of 
 characters so apparently opposite in their habits and 
 manners as the rustic and the polished gentleman, 
 by no moans. A community of feeling as well as 
 of interest sprung up between them, through the me- 
 dium of the intercourse established at the meetings 
 of the Society, held for a special purpose — "the pro- 
 moting of agriculture." The reciprocal advantages 
 to both classes were soon strikingly manifest. The 
 hand that held the plough no longer dijspised the 
 hand that held the pen, since it began to perceive 
 that it was not so idle nor so useless a hand as had 
 been supposed. The cultivator of the soil and the 
 chopper of wood began to think the cultivator of 
 speech and chopper of logic not so contemptible as he 
 had imagined, since he had so frequently hoard him 
 explain, with force and fidelity, principles which he 
 himself understood and maintained, but could not 
 commend or establish, from having th(night the fa- 
 culty of speech not worth cultivating. lie was sorry 
 to think, that while he kept every implement on the 
 farm bright and in good condition, using them freely 
 when occasion required, he had neglected, one im- 
 plement, tho tongue, it having been considered of lit- 
 tle service upon the farm, and therefore suffered to 
 rust for want of use. On the other hand, the man 
 of tact and talent discovered, that though his taciturn 
 fellow member was not fluent in speech, yet he said 
 much in a few words, and frequently with grace de- 
 ferred to him, as Avhen his unprncticed adversary 
 maintained an_ opposite opinion, founded in experi- 
 ence and good jmlgment. Moreover, the man of po- 
 lish and learning could not but perceive, perhaps 
 tliat if the burnishing bestov.x'd on him luid been 
 given to his sturdy though unassuming opponent, he 
 would have developed a brighter and deeper lustro 
 than that which he himself roilected; and that though 
 the fiirmer might bo deficient in head, according to 
 the "cute, go-ahead principle," yet that deficiency 
 was atoned for in the largeness and goodness of the 
 heart that God had implanted in his bosom, and which 
 had never been permitted tj rust, but was ever ac-
