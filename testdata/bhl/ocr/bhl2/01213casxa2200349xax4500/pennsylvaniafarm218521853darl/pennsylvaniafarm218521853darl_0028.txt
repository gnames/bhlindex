MR. GOWEN'S ADDRESS. 

[April, 

reason quite satisfactory to myself that I should not 
 attempt it, and that is, I am so deficient in the sci- 
 ence that I should only render myself ridiculous, did 
 I undertake to elucidate the e ements and agents 
 which nature so mystically employs m the process 
 of vep-etation. They alone are competent to unfold 
 Its mysteries who have devoted their time_ and tal- 
 ents "in acquiring a knowledge of its principles and 
 laws throu'vh scientific research and philosophical 
 experiment— the graduates of the laboratory. For 
 my poor part, I must be content to worship at a dis- 
 tance • not daring to enter the temple, into whose 
 portals the initiated only should claim admission.— 
 But there are matters and things withm our reach 
 and comprehension which, without being presumptu- 
 ous we may claim the right to touch, handle, and 
 understand ; I mean the simple practice of every day 

husbandy. . „ 

Before entering upon that, permit me a word o_t 
 warning, not irrelevant to our object. All experi- 
 ence iuS shown that no discovery in science or phi- 
 losophy has been made, but was put m jeopardy so 
 soon as it had claimed some degree of popularity, by 
 Pretenders and Charlatans. I would then, lor the 
 sake of the cause for which you have associated, and m 
 which I have spent time, money— I will not say tal- 
 ents but such al)ilities as I could command from a 
 too scanty stock, earnestly admonish you not to coun- 
 tenance the speculative quacks, who, for mere lucre 
 and contemptible notoriety, will spring up, relying 
 upon the easy credulity of others and their own bra- 
 zen effrontery, and profess to teach and lecture upon 
 scientific agriculture. We have seen ot late sad 
 specimens of professors, besides those who lately fig- 
 ured in Clairvoyance, Prevision, Retrovision, Mes- 
 merism, Phreno-Magnetism, Psychology, and other 
 mysterious ologies and isms, which, like live coals 
 blown to cinders, have been puffed to death by these 
 philosophic bellows-blowers. And now, since Scien- 
 tific Agriculture is getting into vogue, it would not 
 surprise if some of these "wise men" would turn 
 their mother-wit to profitable account by turning 
 their hand to teaching Vegetable Phiysiology and 
 Agricultural Chemistry. If they should, and meet 
 wil,h the least encouragement, it will retard the im- 
 provement you and other true and disinterested men 
 have essayed to advance. Why? Because it cannot 
 bo disguised that among the generality of farmers, 
 there is a distrust of the means resorted to through 
 the press, appealing to their reason and good sense 
 in well authenticated facts and remits, bearing upon 
 their practice, which, from the prejudice against 
 " Book Farming," they are prone to not heed or 
 credit. If these Pretenders get loose among them, 
 they will sicken and surfeit them to loathing, hj 
 technical jargon and arrant quackery. Besides, which 
 is most t() be feared, the truly well educated profes- 
 sor, whose services would be of the utmost benefit to 
 the' cause, will, through self-respect, refuse to offici- 
 ate as " Professor of Rural Economy," when he per- 
 ceives tlie title has been assumed by others through 
 impudent pretension, and the station defiled by the 
 sheerest humbuggery. This is not all : the legisla- 
 ture to whom we look for aid in furtherance of Agri- 
 cultural Education, might, when appealed' to, be di- 
 verted from the importance due to its consideration, 
 should some clever member, not having the fear of 
 God before his eyes, but the manner in which these 
 self-styled professors perform their fanctions,turn the 
 whole subject of Agricultural Education into bur- 
 lesque audi ridicule. For these and many other co- 
 gent reasons, it behooves the friends of Agriculture 
 to protect it from every taint and speck of quackery. 

That Agriculture is largely indebted to the science 
 of Chemistry, is but a feeble acknowledgment of 
 the benefits already conferred upon it. And to say 
 that much more is yet in reserve for it from the same 
 beneficent and abundant source, is less presumptive 
 than authoritative ; for, from what has been done, it 
 is plain that more can and will be more ably done. 
 Results suggest results, and ever will, till mind and 
 matter shall be wholly resolved, and time be no 
 more! 

Since the developments made by Liebig, in the 
 application of Organic Chemistry to Agriculture and 
 Physiology, mighty efforts, no doubt, are being made 
 by chemists in Europe and in this country upon these 
 and kindred subjects, which must give to Agricul- 
 ture results at once practical and miraculous. I have 
 read or heard it somewhere stated, that ere long it 
 will not surprise to see as much manure compressed 
 within the compass of a pocket liandkerchief as 
 would be suflScient to dress an acre of ordinary land 
 for growing wheat. Notwithstanding the confidence 
 I have in science, I must say, that when this shall 
 happen, there will be a decline in the price of farm 
 horses and working oxen; and without meaning to be 
 irreverent, would pray to be helped in my unbelief. 
 But our doubts are not a proof that the thing is im- 
 possible, for many of us are old enough to have wit- 
 nessed achievements in science now so perfectly fa- 
 miliar to our apprehension as not to challenge our 
 special wonder, which, before having been practical- 
 ly demonstrated, appeared as visionary, as that a 
 handkerchief full of fertilizing ingredients would at 
 no very distant day be found sufficient to manure an 
 acre of ground. 

When Fulton, who was born in your county, first 
 designed to supplant wind, sails and cordage, by 
 navigating with steam, what faith would it have re- 
 quired then to have believed that steam should in 
 so brief a space, less than the length of our own 
 fleeting day, drive wingless ships across the Atlantic 
 in ten or eleven days ; or that in a shorter period, 
 the grass would be growing on your great turnpike, 
 where, but as lately, innumerable Conestoga wagons 
 lumbered along with the products of your industry 
 to the Philadelphia market : and heavy four-horse 
 stages carried you over that road to the city in the 
 prodigious short space of one day, allowing time for 
 the best breakfasts and dinners at the taverns ever 
 passengers were comforted with. When that is com- 
 pared with the rapidity every thing whisked over the 
 same distance now on the railroad, by Fulton's agent, 
 Steam, not allowing time to beget an appetite for a 
 morsel, nor for a glance at the l>eautiful farms thro' 
 which we are steamed with giddy velocity, it is enough 
 to bring the tears into eyes like mine, when remini- 
 scences of the Lancaster Turnpike crowd upon the 
 memory, reminding us of the mutability of human 
 affairs ! I repeat, what degree of faith would it have 
 required to have believed that those things would 
 come to pass, when your neighbor Robert Fulton, 
 was meditating their accomplishment? AVhy, it 
 would have needed the faith thatcould remove moun- 
 tains to have assented to the bare possibility that 
 such things should ever be. And what of the Mag- 
 netic Telegraph, and numerous other things that 
 cause old folks to think that they no longer in- 
 habit the same world in which they were born ? 
 (conclusion in our next number.] 

Chickens are now sent from northern Ohio alive, 
 to the New York market, where they sell for 30 to 50 
 cents a piece. We have known them, says The Plow, 
 to be a drug in the Ohio market at 50 cents a dozen.
