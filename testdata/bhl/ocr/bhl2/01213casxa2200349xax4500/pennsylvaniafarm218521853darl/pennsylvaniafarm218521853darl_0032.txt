CULTIVATION OF FLAX 

[ApriI/, 

We now come to the selection of varieties, which is 
 a matter of considerable importance. After many 
 trials and experiments here in the vicinity of Roch- 
 eiter, and we ought to add extensive experiments 
 both by amateur and market growers, the following 
 varieties are pretty well settled down upon as the 
 best and most profitable : 

Burr's New Pine, (pistillate.) Fig. 1.— A. large, 
 li"-ht red berry of the finest flavor. Productive and 
 hardy. R. G.' Pardee, Esq., of Palmyra, a first rate 
 amateur grower, exhibited specimens at last year's 
 exhibition of the Genessee Valley Horticultural So- 
 ciety, measuring four inches in circumference, and 
 they received the first premium. 

Hovey's Seedling, (pistillate.) Fig. 2. — One of the 
 largest and best American varieties — extensively 
 grown and universally admired. 

Large Early Scarlet, (hermaphrodite.) An old, 
 fine variety. Good size, good flavor, and always 
 bears well. One of the best for planting with the 
 pistillate sorts. 

Boston Pine, (hermaphrodite.) — A large fine, pro- 
 ductive variety, under high culture, but worthless 
 with bad treatment. 

Hudson, (of Cincinnati.) — A most productive va- 
 riety — the great fruit of the Cincinnati market grow- 
 ers. The Rochester people esteem quite as highly 
 Burr's Rical Hudson — a late acid variety, fine for 
 preserving. 

To insure the fertilization of the pistillate sorts, 
 one row of the staminate or hermaphorite varieties 
 should be planted between every four, or in some 
 such proportion. 

It is somewhat remarkable that scarcely any for- 
 eign varieties prove profitable for our cultivation. In 
 England, and indeed in France — the great strawber- 
 ry of the day — the one that in every garden and in 
 every market attracts one's attention particularly — is 
 the British Queen. We have never seen such crops 
 of strawberries anywhere as those of the British 
 Queen around London, in the gardens of the market 
 growers. It does not succeed well here ; or it has 
 not so for, that we are aware of. A few large and 
 fine berries, say three or four from a plant, may be 
 obtained ; but nothing that can be called a crop. It 
 needs more moisture than it gets with us, and we 
 hope to see it yet testsd under favorable circum- 
 stances. 

Next to the Queen stands the Elton. This succeeds 
 the Queen, being later. It is a large, conical, and 
 beautiful Ijerry. We are not aware of its having been 
 successfully grown in this country, but it is worthy 
 of further trial. In Europe no distinctions are made 
 in regard to the " sexual" character of the strawber- 
 ry, as in this country ; all their varieties are stami- 
 nate or hermaphrodite — that is, have both stamens 
 and pistils perfect. 

Cultivation of Flax~Clausseii's method of pre- 
 paring Flax Cotton. 

As a reply in part to the inquiries of our correspon- 
 dent, R. H., in the February number of the Journal, 
 we make the following extracts from a recent pamph- 
 let, entitled " The cultivation of flax, and the prepa- 
 ration of flax by the Chevalier Claussen process." — 
 Since Claussen's great discovery, the cultivation of 
 flax becomes a matter of serious inquiry. We have 
 been favored with a specimen of the flax prepared by 
 this method. It resembles cotton rather than flax, 
 and from the fact that the process of bleaching, &c., 
 is all performed in a few hours instead of months, as 

formerly, must eventually become a matter of great 
 national importance. 

The subject of Flax Culture in the United States, 
 and its preparation by the Chevalier Claussen pro- 
 cess for spinning on cotton and woolen machinery, 
 engrosses at present a considerable share of atten- 
 tion amongst nearly all classes of the community. 

Hitherto we have been dependent on foreign im- 
 portations for supplies of both the raw and manu- 
 factured article. The immense amount of labor ex- 
 pended on Flax, from the time it is sown till it is 
 prepared for spinning on flax machinery, has been 
 such as to preclude the possibility of raising it to 
 advantage in competition with the foreign. Former- 
 ly, when raising Flax for spinning, it was necessary 
 to pull it before seeding, or, when allowed to seed, 
 the straw Avas thrown away as useless ; but by the 
 Claussen process, both straw and seed are equally 
 valuable, and the old mode of pulling can be substi- 
 tuted by mowing or by the reaping-machine. 

The soil best suited for its growth is a black loam, 
 having a substratum of sand or clay. It grows 
 on almost all kinds of soil ; even on the sides of 
 gravelly hills, good crops have been raised, but the 
 latter kind of soil is better for seed than straw. Deep 
 plowing and thorough cleaning are essential to its 
 healthy growth. Many 'consider Flax to be a very 
 exhausting crop, but English and Scotch farmers 
 have found by experience that it does not impoverish 
 the soil near so much as wheat. No soil, with the 
 exception of our Western prairies and valleys, will 
 bear cropping year after year with the same kind of 
 grain, without returning to the soil a portion of the 
 principal ingredients extracted from it. Flax can be 
 raised annually on the poorest description of soil, 
 provided it is manured vfiih. the excrescents coming 
 from animals fed on flax-straw and oil-cake or oil- 
 seed mucilage. 

A practical English farmer gives the foUowirg as 
 the result of his experience in Flax-growing : Quan- 
 tity sown to an acre, 2^ bushels. Quantity of seed 
 raised to the acre, 20J bushels. Amount of straw, 
 2\ tons. Even 22 bushels of seed and 2i tons of 
 straw are not considered a heavy yield. 

The Indiana Journal says: "A farmer in Preble 
 county, Ohio, this season raised 63 bushels of Flax- 
 seed on 3 acres and 10 roods of ground, being over 
 21| bushels to the acre. This, with the prospect of 
 Flax Cotton manufacturing in this country, will indi- 
 cate a prosperous business." 

I know of no crop more profitable for a farmer to 
 raise at the present moment than that of Flax. Say 
 that he could raise no more than 18 bushels to the 
 acre, and 1| tons of straw, and calculating the former 
 at S1.25 per bushel, and the straw at $5 per ton, and 
 deducting 2 bushels for seed, it would amount to 
 $29.25 per acre. If the farmers in this country could 
 be prevailed upon to sow more seed to an acre, the 
 results would be found well worthy of trying the ex- 
 periment. If the Archangel and Riga seed can be 
 had, I would recommend its use for the first sowing. 

What the Farmer most needs. — It is not a col- 
 lege, endowed by the State ; it is primary schools, to 
 prepare farmers' sons and daughters for the higher 
 walks in science as applied to agriculture. They need 
 organization. They want farmers' clubs and neigh- 
 borhood libraries of agricultural books. They need 
 discussion. They need more intercourse, not only in 
 their own town and county, but throughout the State 
 and country, to see and learn what other farmers are 
 doing. — The Plow.
