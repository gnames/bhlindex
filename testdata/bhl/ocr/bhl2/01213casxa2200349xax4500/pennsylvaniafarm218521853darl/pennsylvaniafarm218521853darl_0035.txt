varieties should be planted which mature in a short-

Cultivation. — The principal object to be accom- 
 plished in after cultivation is the destruction of grass 
 and weeds, and to keep the soil well loosened and 
 mellowed, to allow the tender feeders of the plant to 
 ramify in every direction in search of its necessary 
 food, and to put the soil in the best possible condition 
 to absorb the dews and moisture of the atmosphere, 
 and allow the moisture from beneath to arise towards 
 the surface. As to the best mode of accomplishing 
 this result, a difference of opinion may exist, but it is 
 questionable if any thing better can be brought into 
 requisition than the common fluke harrow or culti- 
 vator. 

Qualitij of seed. — The quality of the seed is of the 
 first importance. It is unreasonable to suppose that 
 good and improved crops can be obtained by plant- 
 ing inferior seed. Seed of every description should 
 be selected from the most perfect and best developed 
 of its kind. J. A.

There are but two species of Manuta now known, 
 unless there should be a difference between the Eu- 
 ropean and American plants. Our plant is set down 
 as a foreigner, but it has the appearance of a native 
 in the west, where it is very abundant in the vicinity 
 of towns and villages, where it often becomes a great 
 nuisance if not kept in subjugation. It never grows 
 in the woods, but delights in neglected grounds, es- 
 pecially in limestone soils. In the West it often fol- 
 lows fallows, and is then deemed very troublesome. — 
 I have noticed it spreading very rapidly in many 
 parts of this State during the last ten years, and al- 
 though an annual, it is not easily expelled, for the 
 seeds will lie a long time without having their ger- 
 minative properties destroyed. 

It grows to the height of from 6 to 12 inches, cov- 
 ered with short hairs, it is much branched ; the leaves 
 are three times divided, the segments, flat, narrow 
 and sharp pointed ; the flowers terminate the long 
 leafless, slender-grooved branches, each one bearing 
 a single head, which are yellow in the centre and 
 the rays white ; seeds four sided, furrowed and rough, 
 brown. 

It blossoms from June to November, affording a 

profusion of flowers about the size of camomile, but 
 they are never double. The whole has a strong, un- 
 pleasant smell, and a bitter nauseous acrid taste. — 
 It is often used as an auxiliary to a lobelia emetic. 

The best means to control it, is to mow it frequent- 
 ly and thus keep it from producing seeds. 

It is not generally regarded as a nuisance, and if 
 permitted to remain undisturbed, it may yet prove to 
 be a great annoyance, indeed. The farmer should 
 promptly destroy all useless weeds and not permit 
 them to obtain a hold on the farm.

 Trees and Shrubs for Fencing. 

About 35 years ago, a wire manufactory was es- 
 tablished near the falls of Schuylkill. At that time. 
 Anthracite coal was not in use, and fuel and fencing 
 more expensive than at present ; and considerable ef 
 fort was then made to introduce a mode of enclosins 
 fields, by planting trees for timber at suitable distan- 
 ces — 15 feet more or less around the field,and connect- 
 ing them by a few bars of wire, from tree to tree. — 
 The projectors indulged themselves in making calcu 
 lations of the profit arising from the timber ; but 
 neglected to make any allowance for the diminution 
 of the crop in the vicinity of the trees. Wire fences 
 were for some time occasionally seen, but the wire 
 was then very costly as compared with the present price, 
 and wire fences did not come much into use, and 
 more rarely on farms than on pleasure grounds. At 
 the present reduced price of iron it may now be worth 
 while to enquire whether wire cannot be profitably 
 used to strengthen hedges to restrain horses and cat" 
 tie; (not swine,) especially such hedges as are formed 
 of trees that are required to be kept dwarfed, such 
 as Osage Orange and Cockspur thorn. By putting 
 the hedge plants at twice the usual distance apart, 
 and by planting posts along the line of hedge say 
 15 feet apart, and connecting them by two wires, 
 one at three, and the other at four feet from the 
 ground — the hedge will offer sufficient resistance to 
 cattle, as soon as the wires are covered by the plants. 
 In cases of plashing or filling up ^hin places in the 
 hedge by bending the plants, they may be fastened 
 to the wires. When the posts decay it will not be 
 necessary to renew them, as the trees or hedge plants 
 will have acquired sufficient size to hold 'a staple or 
 large headed spike to which the wires may be fastened. 

Of trees and shrubs not thorny, hedges are some- 
 times made, but generally as a screen or cover on the 
 edge of a bank ; for this purpose Red Cedar, Common 
 Juniper and Arbor Vitce are suitable, and if con- 
 nected by wire, as proposed above, would probably 
 answer as a farm hedge. 

The price of plants from one to two years old for 
 hedging, of Thorn, Buckthorn or Osage Orange, will 
 vary probably from 6 to 10 dollars per thousand'
