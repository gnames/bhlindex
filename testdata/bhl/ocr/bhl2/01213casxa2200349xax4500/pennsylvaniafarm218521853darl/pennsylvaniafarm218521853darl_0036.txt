which, supposing it to be 10 dollars, the cost of plants, 
 for 60 perches, equal to 90 panels of fence, will be 
 10 dollars, the plants being one foot apart, or 15 dol- 
 lars if 8 inches apart. I believe Osage Orange should 
 not be less than one foot apart, and I have hope that 
 we shall hereafter find two feet apart to be better. I 
 believe that Cattle will not browse Osage Orange or 
 Buckthorn, and therefore they will not require an ad- 
 ditional fence for their protection till they become a 
 hedge. 

Those who choose to propagate from seed will find 
 less difficulty with Osage Orange, Wild Plum and 
 other seeds of large size that come up the first j'^ear, 
 than with Thorn,Buckthorn, Sheepberry, &c.; that do 
 not generally come up till the second spring. It is 
 always better to raise the plants in a good seed bed, 
 in good garden ground, than to sow the seeds where 
 it is intended the hedge shall stand, and thinning 
 the plants to the proper distance. The strong and 
 weak plants should not be intermingled in planting, 
 butthe strong planted together, and the weak together. 

It is well ascertained that the English White thorn 
 which is considered the best hedging plant in En- 
 gland, is very inferior to many of our native plants 
 for hedging here; and it is very probable that the 
 species which may hereafter be found the best for 
 hedges on the gneiss or mica slate ranges, will not 
 be best suited for the purpose on the old red sandstone 
 or other formations. Experience must determine ; 
 and experiments are cheaply made as regards money, 
 but in order to be of much value require care and 
 attention. Will those who have succeeded give us 
 their experience through the Farm Jouanal.

 Remedy for the Grain Weevil. 

Mr. Editor: — In a former number of your valua- 
 ble Journal, I observed a description of the grain 
 weevil, and some directions in regard to its extermi- 
 nation. Deeming it a matter of much interest to the 
 farmer, miller and grain dealer, permit me to recom- 
 mend a plan which I have always found very effec- 
 tual. Take air-slacked lime, pass it though a fine 
 sieve, and apply it at the rate of four quarts to the 
 hundred bushels of grain, in the following manner : 
 First, sweep the floor of the granary perfectly clean ; 
 then sprinkle a little lime regularly over it, either 
 ■with the hand or sieve, as may be most convenient; 
 then place the grain on the lime to the depth of six 
 inches. Apply the lime as before, and rake thor- 
 oughly with a hand rake. Continue placing the lime 
 and grain in alternate layers to any extent that may 
 be required; always being careful to mix well.— 
 Lime may be applied to any kind of grain, without 
 fear of injury, and will be found to be a most certain 
 preventive of that destructive insect, the weevil.

Emigration of Pennsylvania Farmers. 

Mr. Editor : Ever since I became a subscriber to 
 the Farm Journal, I have been anxiously looking for 
 some of your correspondents to say something in re- 
 gard to the emigration of so many of the farmers of 
 Pennsylvania to the Western States. This tide of 
 emigration seems to flow mainly from the Eastern 
 Counties, and those who remove appear to have for- 
 gotten the fact that there are other portions of the 
 State — portions which present as many inducements 
 to the emigrant as the far famed lands of the west. 
 We have lands composed of every var.ety of soils, 
 at almost every price, and abounding in all the conve- 
 niences of market which excellent Canals and Rail 
 Roads leading directly to the seaboard afford. Why 
 is it that this subject has not been more frequently 
 pressed in our Agricultural Journals? as the removal 
 of our farmers cannot but be regarded as an evil of 
 serious magnitude. Almost every one of our news- 
 papers abounds in recommendations of the Western 
 lands. The strongest inducements are held out to 
 emigrants, and those desirous of entering into land 
 speculations ; while the merits of our own beautiful 
 and productive valleys, are wholly ovei'looked. Again, 
 we hear of many farmers purchasing the worn out 
 lands of Maryland and Virginia, at prices as great 
 as they would be asked for lands of excellent quality 
 in many of our Western counties. If it were more 
 generally known that new, rich, and vacant lands 
 are to be had in Pennsylvania, at a less price than 
 the exhausted soils of Maryland and Virginia, might 
 it not have the effect of staying this drain upon this 
 valuable portion of our population ? I think so, and 
 earnestly hope that those who feel interested in the 
 agricultural prosperity of our Commonwealth — those 
 who reside in those sections of the State where good 
 lands are cheap, and where market facilities are good, 
 will make the Farm Journal a medium for communi- 
 cating the facts to the public. By doing so, they 
 will lend a helping hand to a good cause.

Maxims for Farmers. 

Do not sow your grain or cultivate yoar crop in any 
 particular manner because your father did so. He 
 may have followed in the footsteps of your grand- 
 father, and agriculture was not as well understood 
 then as now. " Prove all things and hold fast to that 
 which is good.'' If not reject it and try another plan. 
 Nothing of importance was ever yet gained without 
 some risk. Experiment is the mother of science. 

One acre well cultivated will produce more than 
 two only scratched at, and with far less trouble. 
 What is worth doing at all is worth doing well. 

Do not have a superabundance of farming imple- 
 ments; but let Avhat you have be of the best kind, and 
 keep them well sharpened. A sharp will cut twice 
 as much as a dull one, and do it much better. 

Never plough in wet weather, if you can avoid it. 
 Besides doing injury to the crop, it impoverishes the 
 soil. It will not rain always.
