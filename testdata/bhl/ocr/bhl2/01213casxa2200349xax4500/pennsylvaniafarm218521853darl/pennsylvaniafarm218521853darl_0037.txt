Tlie New Volume~Subjects for discussion, &c. 

In entering upon the second year of the existence 
 of the Farm Journal, we cannot forbear an expression 
 of thanks to those old friends who have again kindly 
 tendered their influence in behalf of the new volume; 
 as well as to the new ones who have so effectually 
 proven their interest in our enterprise. Twelve 
 months since we issued our first number with but a 
 single subscriber. Now, we issue the first number of 
 our second volume with hearty assurances of support 
 from almost every section of our own State, as well 
 as from those adjoining. This is not only encourag- 
 ing, but highly gratifying, and in the name of Penn- 
 sylvania agriculture we thank those who have thus 
 far sustained us. 

During the year upon the threshold of which we 
 now stand, we hope to do much to improve the Jour- 
 nal In typographical appearance, as well as in the 
 character of the matter presented. There are many 
 subjects of vital interest to the farmers of Pennsyla- 
 nia, which we hope to have discussed, and to these, 
 we now take occasion to invite the attention of our 
 "orrcspondents-: 

We would like to present all the information pos- 
 sible in regard to the wool growing interests of the 
 State — the character of the sheep generally raised — 
 the amount of the yield of wool of particular flocks, 
 and of townships and counties — the mode of feeding 
 — the sections of the State best adapted to sheep, and 
 all other matters pertaining to the business. 

We are desirous of presenting all the information 
 possible in regard to the cultivation of Flax, and the 
 discussion of the question whether it might not be 
 made one of the most profitable of our crops. 

We are desirous of learning from the farmers on 
 our own best wheal^growing lands, their method of 
 cultivating wheat — the amount of yield now, compared 
 with that of ten or twenty years since, and the pro- 

fits per acre. The same favor we ask of our experi- 
 enced corn growers. , 

We want practical information on the subjects of 
 liming, green cropping, the use of concentrated ma- 
 nures, the rearing and fattening of stock, the where- 
 abouts of improved stock, the comparative merits of 
 the respective breeds, &c. 

We want all possible information in regard to fine 
 fruits, especially seedlings, and on all branches of 
 horticulture. And to sum up the whole, we want 
 every farmer or friend of agriculture who has tried 
 an experiment which has proved successful, and 
 which he deems valuable, to communicate it for the 
 Journal. 

Shall we have the information upon these various 
 points ? Will our friends respond to this invitation? 
 We hope they will ; promising them If they do, a 
 Journal equal in practical value to any of our neigh- 
 bors. We promise this because we Jmoio that our 
 State abounds in just such material as we require 
 for the fulfilment of our word. Sit down then, at 
 once, or at the first leisure moment, and write out 
 your experience and observation. Never mind fin- 
 ished sentences and well rounded periods. Give us 
 the facts in your own plain common sense way of 
 talking. If they require pruning or dressing, we will 
 attend to it, if you desire it. Do this, and our word 
 for It, Pennsylvania agriculture will, before the ex- 
 piration of another twelvemonth assume its rightful 
 position. 

How OCR Legislators appreciate the Farm Jour- 
 nal. — It afibrds us pleasure to state that more than 
 one hundred out of one hundred and thirty-three 
 members of the Senate and House of Representatives 
 have subscribed for our Journal during the past 
 week. The few who declined were those whose pur- 
 suits are in no wise connected with farming. For 
 this handsome addition to our list, we are Indebted 
 mainly to several members of the House who have 
 ever been our friends. They will please accept our 
 thanks. 

Lengthy Communications. — We earnestly request 
 those who favor us with communications to make them 
 brief and to the point. We wish to present as great 
 variety as possible, and can do this only by publish- 
 ing short articles. Many subjects of course require 
 to be treated at length, and for such, due allowance 
 will be made. AVe are desirous of having our arti- 
 cles copied as extensively as possible, by the newspa- 
 per press; to accomplish which, short communications 
 are absolutely necessary. 

Bound Volumes. — In the course of a week or two 
 we will be able to supply bound copies of the first 
 volume of the Farm Journal. Our stock of back 
 numbers is not large, so that those who wish to se- 
 cure them had better apply early.
