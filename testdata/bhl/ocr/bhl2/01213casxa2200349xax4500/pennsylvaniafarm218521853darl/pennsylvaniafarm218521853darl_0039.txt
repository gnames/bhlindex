has already met with a most cordial reception from 
 fruit growers generally, and merits the attention of 
 every person who feels desirous of improving the cha- 
 racter of his fruit, or the appearance of his grounds. 
 The ample practical experience and high reputation 
 of its author, are the best guarantees of the character 
 of the work. We feel no hesitancy in recommending 
 it to those of cup readers who desire a more general 
 knowledge upon the interesting subjects of which it 
 treats. 

The Monthlies come to us abounding in much to 
 interest. Graham, Godey and Sartain all strive with 
 most commendable energy for the supremacy ; but so 
 well do the trio appear to be matched, that it would 
 seem invidious in us to speak of any one, more highly 
 than the rest. Those of our readers who desire a 
 J:;ood literary magazine, will find it in either of the 
 three. Jfext come Harper and the International, 
 both sterling publications, rich in valuable matter, 
 and well worth the price asked for them, $3. Lit- 
 tell's Living Age, unquestionably one of the best pub- 
 lications of the day, $6 per annum. The Horticultu- 
 rist, the file leader in all that relates to the progress 
 of horticulture in the United States. We always wel- 
 come it with pleasure, and read it with profit. Tlie 
 Western Horticultural Review, Cincinnati, ably edited 

and well sustained by a list of excellent contributors, 
 and one of our very best exchanges. 

The Edinburg Revieic, for January, is received

The marked ability which characterises the articles 

of this long established periodical, renders it a most 

pleasant and agreeable visitor. The contents of the 

present number are, 1st, Genius and Writings of

PREMIUM STRAWBERRY ''MOYAMEKSING." 

THIS new and very superb variety raised by G. Schmitz, Esq , 
 near Philadelphia, and to which a special Primium was awarded 
 by the Pennsylvania, Horticultural Society, was purchased bv the 
 subscriber, and is now after a fair trial of three years, for the first 
 time otVered to the public. 

It possesses advantages over all others that 1 have as yet seen, 
 or cultivated — is remarkable tor its robust and vigorous growth — 
 perfectly hardy, enduring the extremes of heat and cold, is very 
 productive, producing a greater average of large berries from one 
 plant than any other, and nearly equal in size to the '• Hovey's 
 Seedling." Its great merit is its rich and high flavor, in which it 
 excels all others— it is much better adapted for market,. (for which 
 purpose I am growing extensively) as its fruit is not so easily in. 
 jured by carriage. Stro^ig Plants now ready for delivery at $'i per 
 doz., or S12 per 100. JAMES M. TAGE,

AND GRAIN RAKE. 

THIS Rake is got ap in detached pieces, so as to make it conve- 
 nient for transportation and storage, and so complete that any pair 
 of handles and shafts will fit on any Rake of his manufacture. The 
 above Rake can be obtained of the subscriber at his residence, or 
 at his Mills near Newark. Delaware, either by wholesale or retail. 
 They can also be obtained at my several agencies established in 
 Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, of which exten. 
 sive notice has already been given. 

The utility of this Rake is so well established and extensively 
 known, that it is deemed unnecessary to dwell much upon its mer- 
 its in this advertisement. It is proper however, to state that it has 
 always been awarded the premium, at Agricultural Exhibitions, 
 where the competition was fair. 

The utmost care is observed by the manufacturer in the selection 
 of timber for these Rakes. None but the best bjing used for that 
 purpose. They are also ironed in the best manner. Having been 
 engaged in their manufacture for thirty years, the subscriber is 
 very desirous that the high reputation which these Rakes have 
 hitherto maintained should be sustained. It is therefore his wish 
 to dispose of them as far as practicable, by wholesale 

Dealers in Implements will do well to send in their orders at 
 an early day. Orders shall be filled immediately, and the Rakea 
 delivered at the most convenient landing or depot for further 
 transportation. 

These Rakes have been found to be the most economical in use, 
 saving their cost at a single day's raking of Hay or Grain. They 
 have also been found very useful in taking straw from a thresher 
 to where it is wanted to be stacked. W. 6. JOHNSON.

SIDLE'S HUB, AUGUR AND BOX REGULATOR. 

THE subscriber residing in DiUsburg. York county, Pennsylva. 
 ma, has invented a new and improved Augur for the boring of hubs, 
 and setting the boxes of wagoii.carriage and oth«r vehicle wheels 
 for which I have obtained letters patent. 

The Augur will bore both ends of the hub at the same time, or 
 either separately— and is the most useful and important invention 
 of the age for inserting wagon boxes and the only Machine in ex- 
 istence by which they can be inserted exactly true- and is so per- 
 fectly simple in its construction, and constructed on such just me- 
 chanical principles, that it cannot possibly get out of repair. 

With this Augur a set of boxes can be inserted in a few minutes 
 —where under the old system it requires hours to perform the 
 same amount of work. 

Persons wishing to purchase Territory or Shop rights will please 
 address the subscriber, who will sell on terms that will enable the 
 purchaser to make money. HENRY SIDLE
