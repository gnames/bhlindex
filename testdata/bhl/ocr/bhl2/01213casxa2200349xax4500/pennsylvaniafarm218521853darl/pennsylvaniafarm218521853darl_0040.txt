THE above Horse Powers have been awarded the highest pre- 
 miums at the Fairs of the New York State Agricultural Society in 
 1850, and again in 1851; also, the highest Premium at the Michigan 
 State Fair, at Detroit, Mich., in September, 18.51, where amajority 
 of the Committee owned and were using Wheeler's Powers on 
 their farms, having purchased them previous to seeing our own : 
 also a Gold Medal at the American Institute, in 1851. It was also 
 exhibited at the State Fairs of Ohio, Maryland and Pennsylvania, 
 and received the highest awards wliich could be given by the rules 
 of their Societies. In every case, it has been in competition with 
 all endless chain Powers of any note in this country. 

Over SIX HUNDRED setts of the above Powers were sold and 
 put in use from June to January last, not one being returned or failed. 

To enable the public to distinguish the above Horse Power from 
 all others, we here show its principal, and most important parts, 
 by diagrams and references — beside like diagrams and references 
 of the Rack and Pinion Power, as made by ourselves, Wheelers, 
 and others; and also the Rack and Pinion, with epicycloydal teeth, 
 which has long been successfully used in this vicinity, and which, 
 with our recent improvements, in its adaptation and application to 
 our Horse Power machinery, places it the first (m the list of Rack 
 and Pinion Powers.

 rods crossing the power and extending through the lines, and 
 far enough outside to receive the small trucks. 

A. — Side view of a section of one of the pinions or small cog wheels, 
 two of which are placed upon the main shaft, and receive 
 the motion and force from the cogs on the linksof the chain. 
 This pinion is about four and a half inches diameter, and the 
 band pulley is used upon the sameshaft,which for threshing, 
 is four feet diameter. The lower view represents the teeth 
 or cogs, as seen with links inverted.

-Shows a side view of one of the links or sections of the chairs 
 of which there are but sixty, or thirty on a side, and are 
 each seven inches long ; every alternate link is cast with 
 dowels, a.a.a.a.a.a. projecting each side ; those on the inside 
 connecting with;the other links, while those on the outside re- 
 ceive the truck wheels, thus avoiding tlie necessity of small 
 shafts, and expense of fitting up. The eyes of the links and 
 truck wheels are cast upon steel chills — making a perfect, 
 and hard smooth surface, which will not wear or break — 
 whilethedowelsaresufRcieiitlylargeand strong to withstand 
 more than the cogs themselves. 

The lower edge of each link is widened equal to the face 
 of tlie pinion, and the cogs made to extend tbe whole width 
 of the pinion, as shown in the lower cut, representing the 
 link inverted, presenting double the strength and driving sur- 
 face, as shown in the last kind j every alternate link is con- 
 fined to the plank flooring by a small screw bolt passing 
 through a flange upon the inside of the link, and under the 
 plank itself.
