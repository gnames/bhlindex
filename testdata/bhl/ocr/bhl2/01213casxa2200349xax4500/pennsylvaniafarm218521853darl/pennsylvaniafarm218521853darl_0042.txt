Depot No. 40, Peck Slip, New York. 

THIS manure is so combined, that the Ammonia and other fer- 
 tilizing gases are absorbed, fixed, and are given out to vege- 
 tation only as it requires them. No rot, mildew, worm^ fly or - 
 other insect can approach it: an important consideration to farmers ' 
 generally, but particularly in potato planting. It will be admirably 
 adapted to the renovation, restoration and fertilizing of such lands 
 as have been worn out. 

It may be used broadcast, after the ground is ploughed, and then 
 harrowed in with the seed. It is also valuable as a top dresshig. 
 Six acres per day can be thus manured in a day by one man. 

It may be used with the greatest advantage on Corn, Potatoes, 
 Wheat, Tobacco, Garden Vegetables, Rye, Oats, Green House 
 Plants, Flowers, Vines, AVall Fruit, &c.,and more than a thousand 
 certificates from the most celebrated Farmers and Gardeners, can 
 be shown, all testifying in the highest terras to its great value as a 
 fertilizer. A pamphlet containing these certificates can be had, 
 by applying to the manufacturers. The riiiCE is only one cent 
 PEB poDND. It is put up in bbls. averaging 235 lbs., or in casks, 
 from 1000, to 1400 lbs. 

TERMS, Cash, or approved credit on delivery. Persons wish-

FARMERS PROTECT YOUR HOUSES & BARNS.' 

So many accidentshave happened from lightning during the past 
 Summer, that every prudent and careful farmer should at once 
 adopt such means as will be most effectual in preventing them. — 
 When it is remembered that certain safety may be secured at a 
 very trifling expense, it becomes the duty of every farmer and 
 good citizen to avail himself the proffered means. By so doing, 
 he not only secures his property from fire by lightning, but pro- 
 tects also his family and those around him. These are important 
 considerations and should have great weight. Those who desire a 
 a Lightning Rod, pronounced by the first Scientific men in our 
 country, the very best in use, will find it on application to THOS. 
 ARMITAGE, at his Magnetic Lightning Rod Factory, Vine Streetl 
 3 doors above 12th, Philadelphia. These Rods are finished with al, 
 th e improvements at nea rly the same prices as the old kind. (tl. 

^^^ CUMBERLAND NURSERIES. 

Th^ proprietor of the above establishment, in calling the atten- 
 tion of the public to his present stock of Fruit and Ornamental 
 Treesi Shrubs, Plants, Vines, &c., would call especial attention to 
 his extensive stock of well grown and beautiful Apple Trees, em- 
 bracing a complete collection, collected from several hundred va- 
 rieties under culture at these Nurseries, and such only reserved for 
 general cultivation, as have proven by actual test to be worthy a 
 place in the prudent man's orchard ; yet for the curious, or those 
 who wish to test for themselves, he is prepared to supply in mod- 
 erate quantities, nearly every variety enumerated in the catalogue. 

In addition to the above, he has also a few hundred thousand 
 extra large and fine Sweet Apple Trees, eight to twelve inches 
 high, (for stock feeding,) which he will sell at from $75 to S85 per 
 thousand, at the Nurseries, and no further charges for packing, 
 simply to cover cost. These last are offered so unusually low on 
 account of his wishing to clear a few acres of his ground this 
 spring. All the above articles virill be disposed of on the most lib- 
 eral terms. 

E^AU orders, post-paid, enclosing the cash, or a satisfactory 
 reference, will be punctually attended to, and all trees carefully 
 labelled, packed, and forwarded to wherever ordered.
