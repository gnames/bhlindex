MONTGOMERY'S 

UNRIVALLED IMPROVED ROCKAWAY 
 SCREENER. 

This celebrated FAN has been thoroughly tested and found to 
 excel all others now in use for cleaning the different kinds of grain. 

This improvement by Montgomery & Brother, consists in a dou- 
 ble shoe— the larger shoe — A as commonly attached to winnowing 
 machines, having grooves into which the screens, sieves or sieve 
 boards are slid and rest. 

B. The curved apron upon which the grain falls after passing 
 through a hopper above. 

C. The door which is made to extend across the curved apron 
 B and opening back on hinges towards the front end of shoe A, 
 rests flat upon the front part of the apron B. The grain passes 
 along the curved apron B and through the aperture of tne door C 
 and falls upon the screen D underneath. The apron is carried 
 over the screen D on to the screen underneath, whilst the screen- 
 ings pass through the screen D into the shoe G underneath, and are 
 carried along the bottom of the shoe G to the centre, wherea spout 
 H receives the screenings and carries them down behind into a 
 box below the bottom of the shoe A. The grain is carried back on 
 to the grain board underneath perfectly screened. 

The persons who have already used these GRAIN FANS have 
 not only spoken in flattering terms of them, but prefer them to all 
 others they have used— and very many of the best Agriculturists 
 have given their certificates that the fact of these machines screen- 
 in" the grain twice by one and the same operation is the very im- 
 provement they have long desired. Our farmers will now have 
 the most perfect winnowing machine, which spreads the grain 
 over the upper screen more perfectly than any others now in use. 
 This improvement is so valuable as to have induced the inventors 
 and manufacturers to make application for Letters Patent. 

All orders for the machines will be promptly attended to by the 
 undersigned. J.MONTGOMERY &. BROTHER,

THEFRUIT-GROWER'S HAND-BOOK. 

Encouraged by the very warm commendations of this work, re- 
 ceived alike from experienced Horticulturists and from the wholly 
 inexperienced, the author ventures with some confidence to sub- 
 mit it to the public at large. 

Notes of all the important questions on fruit culture asked of the 
 writer during the last ten years, with a thorough research of Po- 
 mological works, have contributed to render this volume as com- 
 plete as possible, in convenient compass. 

To the lot-holder who wishes to make the most of a few plants 
 and little room, as well as to the extensive planter who wishes to 
 arrange and cultivate his gardens in the most economical and pro- 
 fitable manner, the Hand Book will be found a useful companion 
 for frequent reference.
