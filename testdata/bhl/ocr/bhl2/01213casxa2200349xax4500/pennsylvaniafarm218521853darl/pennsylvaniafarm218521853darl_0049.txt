 The Value of Agricultural Journals. 

Mr. Editor : — The communication of Judge Watts 
 in your February number suggests the fact that intel- 
 ligent gentlemen are much less likely to be led away 
 from judicious farming by unsound speculation, than 
 are those whose want of mental discipline seems like- 
 ly to cause them instantly to embrace as positive 
 truth what may be only a plausible suggestion of se- 
 quences dignified by the name of theory. How con- 
 tinuously accounted for, are doubtful facts, by what is 
 called " my theory on this subject" — and with what 
 wonderful violation of logic, and senseless confusion 
 of consequences from effects unknown or never exist- 
 ing, do many of those who call themselves "plain, 
 practical farmers," discuss the several subjects con- 
 nected with their pursuits. In truth, your "plain" 
 farmers are often so highly ornamented, that the tin- 
 sel of their talk obscures it sense, and the "practical" 
 man the moment he leaves the plough involves you 
 in the obscurity of incomprehensible and intermina- 
 ble theory. With singular inconsistency these are 
 the men who denounce "hook farming" and refuse to 
 take the Farm Journal? I agree with the accomplished 
 President of our State society, that it is a good rule to 
 doubt all dogmas, and that the theory for which no 
 good reason is assigned, should not be received. This 
 however is not the rule with the ignorant. Discard- 
 ing the modern system which is based on facts, and 
 has led to all the great scientific discoveries of late 
 years, they are genuine scholars and follow, in their 
 rude way, the baseless mode of argumentation which 
 rested on conceits called axioms, or assertions termed 
 propositions, and led to results, some of which were 
 ludicrous because ridiculous, and all were useless 
 because uncertain. Truth alone is of real utility, and 
 facts of observation can alone safely guide us to truth 
 of conclusion. A single new and well ascertained 
 fact connected with husbandry, is worth more to the 
 husbandman, than all the speculations of all the phi- 
 losophy from Aristotle to one of our own 

" plain, practical farmers;" to whose notions we have 
 60 often listened with curiously impressed mind and 
 ear as we sat on a log by his side, resting in the sweet 
 shelter of our wood on a hot summer day, from the 
 pleasant toils of the adjoining field. 

Take up any work on Agriculture, and of what do 
 you find it chiefly composed ? 0? facts relating to the 
 subject? No man in the longest life and with the 
 most extensive experience could himself accumulate 
 80 large a mass of practical matter as is contained in 
 the meanest of these treatises. It is singular indeed 
 that the circumscribed experience of a single person 
 should be considered more valuable than the exten- 
 sive observations of many. But this is so much the 
 case, that to find anything about farming in a book, 
 is to insure with many, its instant condemnation. — 

The very persons who thus reject what is written, 
 do not hesitate to base nearly all their operations on 
 the suggestions of their acquaintances, or the tradi- 
 tions of the neighboi'hood ; for indeed, a very small 
 portion of any man's conduct, in any of the affairs 
 of life, is the result of his own unaided judgment. It 
 is true, that to apply indiscriminately all the recom- 
 mendations of the books would be most injurious ; 
 because, allowance must be made for a varietyof cir- 
 cumstances which may modify the results. And 
 special caution must be used with our American 
 works ; not only because of the vast variety of soil, 
 climate, demand, wages, &c., of this country, but be- 
 cause much of their matter is copied from English 
 works, where all these circumstances differ from ours. 

The most valuable American agricultural literature 
 is to be found in the perisdicals. Indeed from them 
 is taken what is of best authority in the treatises. — 
 Neither the New York, Maryland or Ohio periodicals, 
 whether we refer to discussion or fact, are so useful 
 to us as our own will be, if properly conducted. And 
 this depends not so much on the Editor as on the 
 contributors; for they must supply, to a great extent, 
 the matter which the good sense and sound discre- 
 tion of the Editor will place, with such selection and 
 arrangement as may be necessary, before the reader. 
 In this view we may make the Journal the means of 
 combining for the benefit of all, what each finds most 
 valuable. Our interest, not less than our honor is 
 concerned in placing the Fram Journal in the per- 
 manent and prosperous position which will secure this 
 end. 

You asked me, Mr. Editor, to write an article. — 
 Unable to comply with your wishes in the half hour 
 at my disposal, I have endeavored to induce others 
 more competent from leisure and knowledge, to do so. 
 If one of your readers has ascertained a fact not gen- 
 erally known, let him put it in plain words and send 
 it to the Journal, and these hasty lines will not have 
 been useless. Yours truly.

 The use of Tanners hark in Agriculture and llor- 
 ticulture. 

Mr. Editor : Almost every year, petitions are pre- 
 sented to our Legislature, praying that Tanners may 
 be prohibited from throwing their "spent hark" into 
 the various creeks throughout the State. It is a well 
 known fact, that the disposition of this material has 
 always been a source of trouble and considerable ex- 
 pense, especially where tanning is carried on upon a 
 large scale ; and wherever a stream of water affords 
 the opportunity, load after load of it is carted to the 
 banks, to be carried away by the first freshet. Some 
 tanners permit it to accumulate from year to 3'ear, 
 until fbsolute necessity compels them to haul 
 it upon the roads and lanes in the vicinity ; or dis-
