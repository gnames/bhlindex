rocks are sometimes in a decayed and pulverulent

The gneiss projects above the dilivium at Fair- 
 mount and affords extensive quarries in that vicinity 
 and also at the Falls of Schuylkill. The same belt 
 of grey granite gneiss is developed on Darby, Crumb, 
 Ridley and Chester creeks. In proceeding vrestward 
 up the Schuylkill the felspar becomes less, while the 
 amount of mica is greatly augmented. 

This primary formation besides furnishing high- 
 ly crystaline marble in abundance, is rich in many 
 other mineral substances of economic value. Mag- 
 netic iron ore is found in several localities, limestone 
 is abundant, graphite or black lead exists in Bucks 
 county, and steatite or soap stone has long been quar- 
 ried in Philadelphia and Montgomery counties. The 
 prevalence of felspar, especially in the form of kao- 
 lin, while it imparts fertility to the soil will doubtless 
 at some future period be used in the manufacture of 
 porcelain, this being the material to which is chiefly 
 due the superior excellence of the finest china ware.

5. Poppies require much nitrogen and but little 
 phosphoric acid, and are consequently an excellent 
 crop to precede winter grain. 

6. Wlieat and spelt. Of the elementary Ingredients 
 of these nearly one fourth are nitrogenous, appearing 
 principally as gluten in flour. Among the constitu- 
 ents of their ashes, phosporic acid and potash are 
 predominant ; while soda, sulphur and other similar 
 substances are present only in small quantity. Silicic 
 acid is a chief ingredient of the straw. The requi- 
 site nutriment must consequently be present in great 
 abundance, in due proportion, and in a proper state 
 of solubility, if the grain and straw are to be perfect- 
 ly formed and the crop preserved from lodging. From 
 these considerations wheat or spelt should regularly 
 be put in as the first crop after the application of 
 barnyard manure ; and when wheat does not suc- 
 ceed well after recent manuring, the cause will be 
 found in the fact that the ingredients of the soil had 
 not attained the necessary degree of decomposition 
 and solubility. It is therefore always advisable to 
 prepare land for wheat in such a manner as to pro- 
 mote the disintegration and decomposition of the 
 constituents of the soil, and to regulate duly the re- 
 lative proportion of its combustible and incombusti- 
 ble ingredients. If from the rank and luxuriant ap- 
 pearance of the stalks in the spring, it appears that 
 the carbonaceous and nitrogenous elements predom- 
 inate, while the incombustible ingredients of the soil 
 remain inert, the decomposition of the soil must be 
 promoted by stirring it by harrowing and thus con- 

necting in some measure the undue mixture of the el- 
 ements. This renders the importance and advan- 
 tage of drill culture apparent ; and renders it mani- 
 fest, moreover, that this culture can be properly 
 applied only where it is designed to add to and com- 
 bine with the abundant supplies of carbonaceous 
 and nitrogenous matters in the soil, the due and re- 
 quisite proportion of mineral elements. When wheat 
 or spelt are grown as the second or third crop after 
 the land has received a dressing of barnyard manure, 
 and when the preceding crops were such as require 
 and absorb much sulphur, then gypsum or liquid 
 manure acidulated by sulphuric acid, should be ap- 
 plied. The reason why wheat following wheat, in 
 the same field, rarely succeds well, is to be found^jn 
 the fact that this crop requires and takes from the 
 soil large quantities of phosphorus, and consequently 
 the second or succeeding crop seldom finds a sufficient 
 supply of this material remaining in the land. But 
 a deficiency of potash in the soil may also cause the 
 second crop to fail. Hence, if two crops of wheat 
 are designed to be grown in succession on the same 
 field, prudence requires that the soil should be furn- 
 ished with an adequate store of phosphorus and pot- 
 ash, if it do not naturally contract these 'substances 
 in very great abundance. This may be effected by 
 manuring it with guano, ashes, or bone-dust proper- 
 ly prepared with sulphuric acid. 

7. Rte. The chief elementary constituents of the 
 ashes of this plant and grain, are phosphoric acid 
 and potash, with relatively little lime or sulphur. — 
 Rye also contains somewhat less of the nitrogenous 
 elements than wheat ; while its straw contains much 
 silicic acid. Hence, rye is advantageously cultivated 
 as the first crop, after the soil has received a dress- 
 ing of barnyard manure. 

8. Barley. This grain contains a considerably 
 smaller proportion of the incombustible elements, 
 and especially of the nitrogenous substances, than 
 either wheat or rye — only about eight per cent ; and 
 it likewise contains much less carbonaceous matter. 
 Of its incombustible ingredients, phosphoric acid is 
 the chief, though it contains less thereof than is found 
 in wheat or rye. Next come silicic acid and soda, 
 though only in small quantity. Of potash and lime 
 barley contains but little, though its proportion of 
 sulphur is somewhat greater than that of the other 
 cereals. As barley needs considerably less potash 
 than wheat or rye, it may advantageously follow 
 either of them in course, if the soil be in other re- 
 spects still in good condition. But barley succeds 
 best after potatoes or turnips, because after such 
 crops it finds the soil well stirred and loosened, and 
 its required aliment in the proper state of solubility. 
 When barley is to follow winter grain, it is well to 
 give the toil a dressing of bone-dust dissolved in di- 
 lute sulphuric acid, thus supplying two of the sub- 
 stances which are indispensable to the growth of this
