grain — namely, phosphoric acid and sulphur. If 
 barley be grown on land which abounds in nitrogen- 
 ous substances, the grain will be found to contain an 
 excess of nitrogen in the gluten, and be devoid of 
 starch, which is a substance containing no nitrogen. 
 Such barley contains indeed an increased proportion 
 of nutritious elements, and consequently yields flour 
 better suited for bread ; but it is almost entirely use- 
 less for brewing, because beer brewed from it con- 
 tains but little spirit, clarifies with great difficulty, 
 and has a decided tendency to become stale very soon. 

9. Oats. This grain contains the smallest propor- 
 tion of the nitrogenous elements, and may therefore 
 be cultivated on soils containing very little of such 
 substances. Silicic acid predominates in oats over 
 the other incombustible elements ; while phosphorus, 
 potash and sulphur occupy only a subordinate rank. 
 Oats consequently require less of these substances 
 than any other species of grain ; on which account 
 this crop is content with inferior soils, and will thrive 
 where no other grain succeeds. But as oats require 
 an exccess of silicic acid for the formation of its 
 haulm or straw, the land intended for this crop 
 should be repeatedly ploughed in the preceding au- 
 tumn. 

10. Millet. The elementary substances of this 
 grain are the same as those of oats ; but the plant 
 does not possess the same vigorous vegetative power. 
 With proper cultivation, it succeeds best in poorer 
 soils, containing naturally the same elements which 
 oats require. 

11. Indian Corn or Maize. Though this plant 
 requires very little nitrogen,, it needs most abundant 
 supplies of phosphoric acid and potash, and is espe- 
 cially benefitted by a dressing of well rotted barn- 
 yard manure. 

12. Lucerne, Lime takes the first rank among 
 the constituents if this valuable plant ; after which 
 come potash and phosphoric acid. It also contains 
 sulphur and soda, with only a small proportion of 
 silicic acid. Of its combustible elements the greater 
 part are nitrogenous. Lucerne possesses uncommonly 
 great powers of vegetation. By means of its deeply 
 penetrating roots, it reaches and draws up again the 
 Substances which the rains have carried down deep 
 into the soil or subsoil. One consequence of this 
 however, is that the soil must become the more ex- 
 hausted the longer it ia occupied by this plant ; and 
 tlie duration of lucerne, as a productive crop, is long- 
 er or shorter according as the land on which it is cul- 
 tivated contains naturally a greater or less amount 
 of its appropriate and required nutriment. And as 
 the restoration of the substances drawn up by the 
 roots of lucerne from the depths of the soil, proceeds 
 only very slowly, it is readily explained how it hap- 
 pens that this crop can be cultivated with advantage, 
 on the same land, at long intervals only. 

13. Red Clover. In this plant also the predomi- 

nating ingredients are lime and potash, with a not 
 inconsiderable proportion of sulphur, but less phos- 
 phoric acid and nitrogenous substances. The re- 
 markable effects of gypsum on this crop have already 
 been explained. The reason why red clover will not, 
 ordinarily, thrive well on the same land, except at 
 long intervals, is because, the particular substances 
 which clover requires are speedily exhausted and 
 cannot be rapidly enough replaced by the natural pro- 
 cess of disintegration and commixture. Another 
 cause may be found in the absence of calcareous mat- 
 ters in the soil ; and as the very slow development 
 and formation of potash in the soil may at times pre- 
 vent the due growth of this plant, a seasonable appli- 
 cation of unleached ashes may serve to prevent a fai- 
 lure of the crop. As the roots of the red clover col- 
 lect from the subsoil and store up the principal in- 
 gredients required by wheat and spelt, it proves itself 
 to be a very valuable forerunner of those grains. 

14. EsPARCELTE, or sainfoin. Its principal consti- 
 tuents are lime, phosphoric acid, soda and sulphur, 
 with less potash than the other clovers contain. As 
 it also contains a certain proportion of nitrogenous 
 elements, it on the whole greatly resembles red clo- 
 ver in its characteristics, except that it contains less 
 potash and more soda ; and its prominent elementary 
 ingredient is lime, it delights in a calcareous soil. — 
 Like lucerne, and for the same reason, it succeeds 
 well on the same land, only at long intervals. 

15. White Clover. Its chief ingredients are pot- 
 ash and lime. It thrives best on hill sides with a 
 clayey soil, where the gradual abrasur of the surface 
 is continually exposing fresh layers of the clay to the 
 process of disintegration. 

16. Beans. These contain much nitrogen ; require 
 a large proportion of potash, soda, and sulphur ; and 
 therefore properly come in as the first crop in a ro- 
 tation, after the application of fresh barnyard ma- 
 nure. 

17. Lentils. These are similar in their composi- 
 tion to beans, as are 2.)eas likemse. But neither 
 peas nor lentils succeed well after a dressing of 
 fresh manure, as it causes rankness of vegetation 
 and prevents the formation of seed. 

18. Vetches. These also are very similar to beans 
 in their elementary ingredients; and green vetches 
 plowed under are a most excellent manure, because 
 thereby the carbonic acid and ammonia they contain 
 are arrested and fixed, and the potash is brought into 
 a soluble state. Tctches intended to be plowed down, 
 should receive a dressing of gypsum, because they 
 need lime and sulphur, and their fertilizing proper- 
 ties are gi'eatly enhanced by these substances. 

19. Buckwheat. The grain of the plant, in its 
 composition, resembles that of rye, for which reason 
 it requires a similar soil, and like conditions as re- 
 gards manure. 

20. Hemp contains a large amount of carbonaceous
