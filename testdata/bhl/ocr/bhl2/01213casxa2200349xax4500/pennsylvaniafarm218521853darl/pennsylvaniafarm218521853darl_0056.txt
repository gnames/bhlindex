matter, with proportionally little nitrogen. In its 
 ashes, lime is the predominant ingredient and occurs 
 in considerable quantity. Next in order, come pot- 
 ash, silica, phosphoric and sulphuric acid. Its re- 
 maining ingredients require very small supplies of 
 manure; but a liberal application of lime and sul- 
 phur is indispensably necessary, which are furnished 
 by a dressing of gypsum, and the application of liquid 
 manure. The land also must be very thoroughly 
 tilled. As hemp takes up but little of the ingre- 
 dients required by winter grains, with the excep- 
 tion of lime only, it proves a good precursor of such 
 crops, if the land has previously been well dressed 
 with barnyard manure. 

21. Flax. Silicic acid constitutes the principal 
 element of this plant. Then follow lime, phosphoric 
 acid, potash and soda, in about equal quantities ; and 
 lastly sulphur, of which flax contains about twice as 
 much as hemp. Carbon and oxygen constitute much 
 the greater portion of its gaseous elements, while it 
 is found to contain but very little nitrogen. 

22. Turnips. These contain much albumen, and 
 consequently much nitrogen; then follow lime, soda, 
 potash and phosphoric acid in considerable abund- 
 ance ; with a large proportion of sulphur and oxyd 
 of manganese — from which ingredients their nutri- 
 tious qualities are derived.

Ornithogalum is said to be derived from the Greek 
 ornis, a bird, and gala, milk. The German signifies 
 bird's milk. It is said to be the plant referred to in 
 2d Kings, vi, 25, as " dove's dunj," — "a7id tJie fourth 
 part of a cab of dove's dung for five pieces of silver." 

There are nearly eighty species known, chiefly in- 
 digenous to the south of Europe, South America and 
 Africa. The roots of several species are eaten, tho' 
 they are not very palatable. According to Pallas, 
 the roots of the 0. pilosum, are eaten by the Greeks 
 of the Crimea. 

The plant under consideration is from Europe, and 
 is very frequently introduced into flower gardens, 
 from which it is apt to escape, and if neglected, be- 
 comes a serious nuisance. I have noticed it in the 
 spring of the year in the vicinity of Philadelphia, and 
 also in Delaware and Chester counties, having pos- 
 session of large plats of land. It is propagated by 
 the bulbs very rapidly, and I am informed, when it 
 takes possession of the soil it is almost impossible to 
 extirpate it, so exceedingly tenacious of life are the 
 roots. 

It belongs to the 6th class Hexandria, 1st order 

Monogynia, in the Artificial System of Linnagus. To 
 the Natural Order Liliacce and Tribe AsjjJiodelece in 
 Gray's Botany of the Northern U. S. 

The roots are small white bulbs, like little onions. 
 The leaves are from six to twelve inches long, nar- 
 row, furrowed, and very smooth; green, with a white 
 line running along them. The stem is from six to 
 ten inches high, branched near the top, round and 
 smooth. The flower stem one to two inches long, 
 with a narrow thin leaf at the base ; leaves of the 
 flower white within, green externally, with a white 
 margin. The pod is thin, somewhat three cornered, 
 each cell containing a few dark, roundish seeds. In 
 a wild condition it seldom produces seeds. 

One means of destroying it is to plough up the 
 bulbs in the fall, and turn sheep on them to eat them. 
 Another is to subsoil plough the land, and bury the 
 bulbs too deep to grow ; others sow salt on them to 
 induce the cattle to eat them, but the best way is to 
 eradicate them from the garden and neighborhood 
 before they get into the farm. In this plant, an ounce 
 of preventative will be found better than two pounds 
 of cure. J. M. McMinn.

Raising Calves~A Ncav Method. 

While on a short visit to the farm of Mr. D. M. 
 Crowell, of this town, a few days ago, our attention 
 was drawn to a plan of raising calves for early sale, 
 which, to us, in this section of the country, has the 
 appearance of novelty, and seems worthy the atten- 
 tion of stock growers. 

Mr. Crowell took ten calves (all heifers) last spring, 
 and commenced feeding them on sour milk at a few days 
 old, keeping them on the same kind of food during 
 the summer, taking good care to feed them uniformly, 
 but not very abundantly, so as to keep them growing 
 thriftly without forcing too rapidly. In the fall they 
 were put in the stable, and fed on hay and a little 
 meal, increasing the quantity of the latter gradually, . 
 with a view of fitting them for Beef in the spring, at 
 one year old or a little under. 

These ten calves now look like young oxen, and 
 are estimated to weigh about 500 lbs. each alive. — 
 They will probably be sent to market soon, say next 
 month, when we shall see how it will be relished by 
 the lovers of good eating. For ourselves we should 
 hardly find it in our hearts to decline a dinner from 
 one of the best of them. We understood from Mr. 
 C, who is one of our best farmers, and who is mak- 
 ing this trial by way of experiment, that he is not 
 quite satisfied thus far with the present attempt to 
 raise Beef in one year, and that he intends to renew 
 the experiment another year, when he thinks some 
 improvement can be made. — N. T. Farmer.
