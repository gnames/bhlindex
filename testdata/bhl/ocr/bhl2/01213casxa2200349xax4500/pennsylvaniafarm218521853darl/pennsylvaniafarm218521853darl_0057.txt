CONCLUDED. 

My object in adverting to those -vronderful discov- 
 eries, is, to ask of you, brother farmers, to admit the 
 possibility of great changes being made in the prac- 
 tice of culture and husbandry, and what is equally 
 important, to admit that changes are really needed 
 to bring us on a footing or along side of other callings, 
 who, by some short cut, have got the start of us, and 
 can turn out better work and more of it than they 
 did or could do forty years ago ; while we remain 
 pretty much in the same condition we were in then ; 
 working as hard and making as little as at any time 
 within our recollections; wheat, corn, roots, grass, 
 etc., scarcely maintaining their former average per 
 acre, while the cost of producing them is certainly 
 not diminished. Well, having, as I hope you have, 
 admitted all this, I would take occasion to ask you 
 to go a step further, and that is, for every one to re- 
 solve, by every means in his power, through observ- 
 ing, experimenting, reading and comparing, to gain 
 more knowledge and throw more light on the theory 
 and practice of Agriculture, for the purpose of im- 
 . proving his own practice, raising the character of the 
 profession, and increasing the wealth of the State, 
 by increase of products and bringing the lands into 
 higher condition. 

Inspired with the hope that you are prepared to 

listen to suggestions tending to 

improvement, from 
 I now return to the 
 on the practice of 

even the least pretending source 
 remarks I had intended to make 
 every-day Husbandry. 

It is a good old maxim, that " whatever is worth 
 doing at all, is worth doing well," and, that " we 
 should begin at the beginning." Agreeably to this, 
 I shall begin at the Manure, which, if not the basis 
 of good culture, is indispensable to the production of 
 crops on such lands as we cultivate. The manure 
 heap is aptly termed the farmer's golden mine, from 
 which he extracts the veritable ore itself, through a 
 process of a^say and coinage, elaborated on his fields, 
 tiy Nature's self, through every stage of vegetation, 
 from the embryo germ to the perfect maturation of 
 every plant. No skill, no shift, that I have witness- 
 cil, ever did succeed in producing even a tolerable 
 crop of grain or roots without a liberal application of 
 manure, proportioned to the condition of the land and 
 the nature of the crop to be raised, without exhaust- 
 ing it to a greater degree in value than the profit 
 realized from the wretched product forced from the 
 impoverished soil. How essential then is it that eve- 
 ry degree of care, every expedient should be resorted 
 to by the farmer, to increase and preserve in the best 
 condition, every thing within his reach, having the 
 character and quality of manure ; and, how lamenta- 
 ble to witness the general inattention so prevalent 
 among farmers to this first indispensable point in a 
 good husbandman ! You may visit any number of 
 farms, on none of which but it is almost certain to 
 find the farmer at work — even hard work — and yet, 
 a glance at the condition of his stables and barn-yard 
 is sufficient to show that he is laboring in vain, while 
 the stables and yard are neglected, and the manure 
 permitted to waste so shockingly — one day's waste 
 in this quarter, if prevented, would repay perhaps a 
 week's work of such labor as engages his attention. 
 Now it is not pretended that in looking to the ma- 

nure, he should neglect the other work; both can, 
 and should be attended to ; the thing required is pro- 
 per attention to both, conformably to economy and 
 good management. If the stables and pens have not 
 been emptied or cleaned for a week or a month ; if the 
 manure heap is not well constructed to prevent wash- 
 ing and waste — if the droppings of the cattle in and 
 about the yard are not constantly taken up while 
 fresh and thrown upon the lighter substances upon 
 the heap, but are left to be burnt to cinders by the 
 sun, and tossed a,bout with the winds, or washed by 
 the rain, or frozen with the frost ; of what avail is 
 labor on land thus cheated of its nourishment while 
 being worked to death ? If such things be, it were less 
 than full measure of justice to call them disgraceful; on 
 the other hand, if duly attended to, the propriety of do- 
 ing these things is so self-evident, and the ease with 
 they may be performed under a proper system,which so 
 apparent, that but little commendation is due for the 
 service. He who would be deserving of praise in 
 this respect should bo found adding to the manure 
 heap gatherings from ditches, decayed wood, leaves, 
 weeds, bones, and the droppings of horses and cattle 
 on the roads and lanes near to the farm, with many 
 other things not necessary to mention here, all of 
 which, from time to time, might be collected at little 
 expense of time. It may be asked what can be done 
 with the bones ? The best way of converting them 
 into manure would be to grind them; an apparatus 
 might be profitably employed for the purpose. They 
 can easily be reduced by saturating them with a solu- 
 tion of one part sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) and two 
 parts water, when placed in a heap, underlaid and 
 surrounded with mould, as sand is placed around 
 lime to make mortar, throwing in the mould occasion- 
 ally to unite and catch the falling substance from the 
 bones. As all may not be reduced by the first sprink- 
 ling, another heap may be formed of so much of the 
 old one as remains unreduced, proceeding as at first 
 till all is reduced. If this method be considered too 
 troublesome, the bones will be found to be worth all 
 the trouble of gathering them, for placing in the ma- 
 nure heap, to be thrown aside when the manure is 
 being hauled out, to be again deposited in the suc- 
 ceeding heap. Their decomposition will be slow, it 
 is true, but their presence in the heap will more than 
 repay the trouble of keeping them from year to year. 
 They may be put away at once by burying them near 
 the roots, at a suitable distance from the stems, of 
 pear and other fruit trees, and grape vines ; the fine 
 fruit that will in after years be produced by the trees 
 thus treated will attest their value. I am thus par- 
 ticular in pointing to bones, not only on account of 
 their fertilizing properties, but to awaken attention 
 to the necessity of husbanding everything available 
 for manure. It seemed strange that we should wit- 
 ness the gathering of bones at our very doors, along 
 our rivers and canals, to be shipped at Philadelphia 
 to England for manure, and not avail ourselves of an 
 article that the English farmers consider worth im- 
 porting from so great a distance. It is asserted that 
 over four millions of dollars' worth of bones are an- 
 nually consumed in England for agricultural pur- 
 poses. Then to think of the folly of purchasing gua- 
 no, imported from Peru, at forty dollars per ton, 
 when it is in our power to make a full supply of ma- 
 nure at home. The farmer who cannot maintain 
 his land in high condition by the manure made upon 
 his farm, is not worthy the name of husbandman. — 
 How should this be done? I answer by keeping a 
 large stock of cattle, and letting nothing go to waste. 
 " Waste not, want not," is a saying worthy of special 

regard.
