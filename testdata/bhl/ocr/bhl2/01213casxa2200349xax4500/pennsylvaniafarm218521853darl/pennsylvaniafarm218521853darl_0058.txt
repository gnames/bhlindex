MR. GOWEN'S ADDRESS.

be taken into account: one load of well-preserved 
 manure, from the heap of a pains-taking farmer, is 
 worth two loads of his who is careless — this is fifty 
 per cent, in favor of the former. Guano cannot be 
 objected to as a manure, for it abounds in fertilizing 
 ingredients, but its cost is objectionable. In our cli- 
 mate, the same amount of money paid for guano, if 
 invested in stable-yard manure, would be of more 
 benefit to the land in the long run. No manure is 
 more to be relied upon than that furnished by horses, 
 cattle, sheep and swine. In the year ending the 30th 
 June, 1850, there was imported into the United 
 States no less than twenty-one thousand two hundred 
 and forty-three tons of guano ; this, at forty dollars 
 per ton, amounts to eight hundred and forty-nine 
 thousand, seven hundred and twenty dollars. At the 
 port of Philadelphia alone, in 1851, four thousand, 
 nine hundred and eighty tons were imported; if sold 
 at the price quoted, it -yould amount to but little less 
 than two hundred thousand dollars. 

Of all the concentrated or extraneous manures, 
 poudrette, when properly manufactured, is the best 
 and cheapest, and, for obvious reasons, should be 
 most encouraged. A large supply of this excellent 
 article may soon be expected from the works about 
 being established by Professor Peyson, a clever 
 French Chemist and engineer, who has made ar- 
 rangements with the Board of Health of the city of 
 Philadelphia for disinfecting or deodorizing cess 
 pools, and the converting sewerage and putrescent 
 substances into poudrette. I witnessed an experi- 
 ment by him on a cess pool at my residence last May, 
 when he deodorized the contents of an old deep well 
 in the space of fifteen minutes. The object of having 
 it done under my inspection was for the purpose of 
 taking charge of the disinfected mass, at the instance 
 of the Philadelphia Agricultural Society, to ascertain 
 whether the process he conducted would not destroy 
 the fertilizing property of the fecal matter. To this 
 end I applied it to a part of a patch laid ofi" for ruta 
 baga turnip, to be compared with other very strong 
 manure, principally from a slaughter-house. I found 
 the poudrette, through all the stages of growing the 
 crop, equally as effective as the other manure, and 
 giving as good a yield in turnips. This is instanced 
 to show what science can do for agriculture, and to 
 point to resources not often taken into account by 
 farmers. The turning this offensive matter, which 
 among a dense population is a source of inconveni- 
 ence and disease, into a state to be handled with less 
 unpleasantness than good stable manure can be, is a 
 triumph to science, and, if properly encouraged, will 
 add to the agricultural products of the State thous- 
 ands upon thousands of dollars annually. 

To speak of lime, as I feel bound to do, in connec- 
 tion with manure, requires no small degree of cour- 
 age, knowing the great value you place upon it. — 
 Broadly, then, I hold it not to be a manure, in the 
 common acceptation of the term ; and that its so fre- 
 quent application upon a large portion of your land, 
 the heavy loam and clay lands, is not only destruc- 
 tive of the real manure applied to those soils, but to 
 the inherent organic fertility found in them. Quick- 
 lime, spread on or with manure, evolves or liberates 
 the most active elements or fertilizing ingredients in 
 the manure, facilitating their escape into the air. — 
 Not only so, but so long as its causticity continues, 
 which, from the large portion of magnesia generally 
 found in lime — the burning process, if I may be al- 
 lowed the expression — is likely to be kept up for a 
 long time, during which the vegetable ingredients in 
 the soil are being too rapidly and unnecessarily wast- 
 ed, to the great detriment of the soil, and to the in- 

jury of almost every su"l)sequent crop raised upon it. 
 In no case can such lime be safely applied in quan- 
 tity, as is customary, except where the soil is over- 
 charged with vegetable mould or abounds in fibrous 
 roots. If dressing after dressing of fifty or more 
 bushels of caustic lime to the acre be applied every 
 four or five years, nothing can save the soil from the 
 accumulated injuries thus heaped upon it, but the 
 application of a great deal more barn-yard manure 
 than, under the condition of no lime, would be need- 
 ed, to counteract or repair the mischief doing, or al- 
 ready done by the lime. Here, then, is a needless 
 expenditure of lime and manure, which, if time 
 would permit to go into a calculation for a few years, 
 would show an astounding amount in dollars. As 
 well might you be found heaping wood on a fire to 
 keep up a comfortable temperature in a house on a 
 cold day, while you kept the street door open to let 
 in the cold, when half the fuel would serve to keep 
 the house warm if the door were shut, as to apply 
 caustic lime to heavy limestone land, in quantity as 
 it is usually applied, thereby rendering it so neces- 
 sary to put on so much more manure to modify it. 

By way of illustrating the opposite tendencies of 
 lime and manure, suppose a heap of rich manure re- 
 moved from where it had stood some time in a field, 
 the spot on which it stood being surcharged with the 
 liquid it had absorbed from the heap. If seeded in 
 this condition, the grain would not head or fill — at 
 best it would be rusted or choked with weeds. In 
 such a case, what would be the readiest method a 
 farmer could adopt to restore this over-rich spot to 
 usefulness ? Why, nothing more nor less than to 
 administer to the soil a strong dose of quick-lime, by 
 trenching and mixing it well in, throughout the spot 
 affected. This would put its plethora to a purgation, 
 and soon render it lean enough for active service. — 
 On the other hand, a scabby spot, left on a field by a 
 heap of lime, can be restored by pouring a quantity 
 of liquid manure upon it, or by trenching in well- 
 rotted barn-yard manure, in excess. By this it would 
 seem that lime, in some degree, is as antagonistic to 
 manure as the sun is to moisture. But it may be 
 claimed that lime is made use of as an agent to pre- 
 pare food for plants : be it so then, and allow that in 
 some cases its services are useful ; would that justify 
 its indiscriminate application as a feeder, as well 
 where there is nothing for him to do in his line, as 
 where there was something he could do lawfully. 

In the general, lime is so wasteful and ravenous a 
 cook, that he sometimes consumes more than he 
 fui-nishes to the family of plants it is intended he 
 should provide for ; nay, it may be suspected, that 
 when his allotted means fail to appease his gnawing 
 appetite, he will feed on the .plants themselves, 
 though they may have a little of his own blood in 
 them. Do not, I pray you, take this as a wholesale 
 condemnation of lime. As an agent, it is useful in 
 meliorating certain conditions of soil, if judiciously 
 applied. Light sandy, micacious or isinglass, red 
 shale and slaty soils, may in general be benefitted by 
 dressings of lime ; but on clayey limestone soil I 
 shoiild deem its application unnecessary, if not inju- 
 rious. To mix in a good dressing of common sand, 
 would be more rational by far than throwing lims 
 into it. The sand would be harmless at least ; the 
 lime in my judgment could not be so. If the value 
 of the lime, so inappropriately applied, were expend- 
 ed in wood ashes and pulverized charcoal, it would 
 show results incomparably remunerative. In thus 
 pronouncing so unequivocally upon the merits of lime, 
 I am aware of the risk incurred; but if it should serve 
 no other purpose than to lead to a closer observation
