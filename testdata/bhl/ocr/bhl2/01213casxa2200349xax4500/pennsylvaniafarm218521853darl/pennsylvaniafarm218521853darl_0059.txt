of its efiFects by others, I shall feel fully compensated, 
 and content me, in abiding an unprejudiced verdict, 
 on the opinion so frankly avowed. 

This leads me to say a word on another agent, 
 Gypsum, or Plaster of Paris ; and here I feel at per- 
 fect liberty to admit its surprising beneficial effects 
 on soils and vegetation. That so small a modicum 
 of this cheap and easily applied mineral should exhi- 
 bit such wonderful influence in conservating the fer- 
 tility and capability of land to sustain it so ably 
 under the exhausting process of producing, must as- 
 tonish every experienced and experimental farmer ! 
 The question, as to how it acts, is one that has chal- 
 lenged the observation of many inquiring minds, and 
 ieems at this day not to be fully settled. Some hold 
 that it supplies, in itself, an element necessary to the 
 development, growth, and perfoctability of plants, in- 
 asmuch as gypsum, and the sulphuric acid it supplies, 
 are found in the ashes of the plants. Others main- 
 tain that its beneficial agency consists in its conser- 
 vative capacity to husband, or prevent the escape of 
 ammonia and other subtile elements of fertility in 
 the manure and soil, fixing or retaining them in the 
 soil, so as the plants may feed upon them through all 
 the stages of vegetating. To this latter theory I am 
 fully inclined. Those who adhere to the other opinion 
 rely upon, as already stated, the evidence of gypsum 
 being found in the plants ; and hence ihe necessity 
 of an adventitious supply of gypsum, lest the land 
 should be destitute of this indispensable ingredient. 
 But taking this plausible deduction into view, how 
 could so small a quantity as a bushel of plaster, sown 
 on the surface of an acre of land, considering its in- 
 solul:)ility, be taken up in so short a period as the 
 season of growth by a plant, such as wheat for in- 
 stance, whose roots penetrate so far below the surface 
 of the ground ? The shortness of the period of growth 
 will more forcibly apply to clover and grass for mo^v- 
 ing, which, from the time the plaster is applied, till 
 the harvesting of these crops, less than throe months, 
 would be too short a period to expect they could 
 have taken up the plaster sown upon them. That 
 they did not take it up, or any of it, is probable : 
 that they did take it up, could only be proven by 
 chemical tests hardly possible, it is presumed, to con- 
 duct to any positive certainty. 

The theory, then, that the gypsum exerts an influ- 
 ence merely, or only, in holding in solution, as che- 
 mists would say, the fertilizing gases for the use of 
 the plants, seems unquestionable. I am strenoihen- 
 ed in this by experience in sprinkling plaster daily 
 in my stables, for years, on the removal of the litter 
 and dung: its effect is, to abate at once the effluvia, 
 showing the influence it exerts over the ammonia. — 
 Let any one try its effects in a foul stable, and he 
 will soon be convinced of the nature of the service it 
 performs, and its great utility in preserving the vol- 
 atile portion of the manure, so essential to its strength 
 and good quality. 

An excellent opportunity was afforded me last July 
 for proving its effects in this regard. The manure 
 used on the ruta baga patch already alluded to, in 
 juxtaposition with the poudretto, was principally 
 from a slaughter-house ; it was particularly odorous, 
 and I had it plowed in as soon as possible. A few 
 days afterward there came on a heavy rain succeed- 
 ed by a sultry sun, and the patch became very noi- 
 some ; had a bushel of plaster immediately sown upon 
 it; was present when the sowing commenced, but left, 
 and returned to the patch as the operation was fin- 
 ished, and was gratified to find that in so short a 
 period, about an hour, the disagreeable odor had al- 
 most entirely subsided. From this, is it not manifest 

that it was owing to the action of the gypsum that 
 the offensive smell was abated, and that the strono- 
 effluvia was nothing more or less than the ammonia 
 escaping from the soil, which had so recently been 
 impregnated to a high degree by the putrefaction 
 from the slaughter-house manure? Then, did the 
 gypsum neutralize or destroy the fertilizing gas, 
 which was poisoning the atmosphere? or did they 
 both unite, from tlie principle of affinity or attraction? 
 I believe they united. The plaster, in descending, 
 may have carried so much of the gas with it as fetl 
 in its way, purifying or relieving the air of it so far ; 
 and, when lodged on the ground, became a receiver 
 to take in, or a lid to cover the volatile elements of 
 fertility that would escape — holding them until 
 rains and dews should wash them from its embrace 
 to enrich the soil, and furnish fuod to the rootlets of 
 the plants that nestle beneath, waiting for the pre- 
 cious tricklings. If this simple explanation shows, 
 with some degree of accuracy, the action and influ- 
 ence of gypsum, how insensible then must the farmer 
 be to his own interests, who will not provide a suita- 
 ble supply of this perfect God-send of a suljstance, 
 wherewith to sprinkle his stables, his manure, and 
 his fields ? 

While treating of plaster, clover, from association, 
 naturally presents itself; and as time will not permit 
 to enter upon cropping and culture, I feel inclined to 
 make a passing remark upon it hero. There is a 
 prevailing opinion that clover is favorable to the land 
 as a non-exhauster, if not an enricher of the soil. — 
 If it derive this character from the idea that it draws 
 more nour shment from the air than the soil, I beg 
 leave to dissent. I am not much of a believer in the 
 doctrine of atmospheric nutriment, and yet I am not 
 prepared to reject it in toto. A close observation 
 will establish, I think, that it is owing to the shade 
 the clover imparts to the land that it exhausts so lit- 
 tle of the soil. Buckwheat furnishes another instance, 
 with this difference, that the supply required to fill 
 the head or mature the grain in the buckwheat, is 
 greater than what is needed to form the flowers of 
 the clover. Shade is a wonderful consei-vator of soil ; 
 and this suggests liow careful we should be to expose 
 our land as little as possible, in a bare or naked state, 
 to the severity of our summer suns and winter frosts. 
 But to shade may be reckoned tJie loss sustained in the 
 clover, and consequent gain to the land, from so much 
 of it being left on the field at liay-making, especially 
 when the clover is grown with timothy, a practice that 
 cannot be too strongly condemned. The top-dressing 
 thus given involuntarily to the land, from the best 
 and strongest parts of the clover — the fine leaves and 
 flowers, strewn around — contril^utcs in no small de- 
 gree to the good condition claimed for the soil after 
 crops of clover ; add to this, the quantity of clover 
 roots spewed out upon the land through freezing and 
 thawing, left to rot upon it, and you have almost 
 the sum total of the causes wliich load to the hypo- 
 thesis that clover is a non-exhauster, or improver of 
 the soil. If this be the case, is it not proper we 
 should look closer into cause and effect, and not 
 blindly follow illusive practices, so subversive of our 
 own prosperity ? I must not be understood as con- 
 demning tlie practice of growing clover: I condemn 
 it not, but insist that every crop grown should be 
 well husbanded, and put to its proper use, and not 
 waited on the field where it is grown. And here it 
 may not be out of place to explain why clover and ti- 
 mothy should not be grown together. One ruling 
 objection is, they do not ripen at the same time. If 
 the clover be cut when ready for mowing, the timothy 
 cut with it is of little account, not having attained its
