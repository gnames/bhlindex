MR. GOWEN'S ADDRESS.

growth; it shrivels astonishingly in the sun while 
 drying ; what is of it is acid, disagreeable in taste, 
 and unwholesome, from not having matured or ela- 
 borated its, sap. If, on the other hand, the timothy 
 is left to ripen, the clover then is almost a total loss, 
 nothino- of it reaches the barn fit for cattle, or even 
 fit to supply the place of straw. Independently of 
 this if a tine sod is desirable, as it undoubtedly should 
 be it never can be found with timothy and clover. 
 Why ? Because, from the start at growing till the 
 end of their respective terms, they are in habit, taste, 
 and condition uncongenial, and therefore inappropri- 
 ately put together. While growing together the first 
 season, the bushy head of the clover pushes aside or 
 smothers the tiny blades of the young timothy ; next 
 spring, much of the clover has been forced from the 
 o-round by the frosts of winter, leaving the stems and 
 roots of the timothy sadly exposed to the freezing and 
 thawing of March, with its occasional chilling winds ; 
 and hence the impossibility to find a continuous, com- 
 pact sod, on any field thus cropped. And who takes 
 the pains to calculate the loss on spaces left bare 
 where the clover stood, or reflects on the impropriety 
 of wasting land and labor? When timothy is re- 
 quired, it should be sown alone, and permitted to 
 mature suitably for hay. Orchard grass^ and clover 
 may be sown together, because they ripen at the 
 same time, and delight in the same soil : but where a 
 good, well-set sod is wanted, to last for several years, 
 no red clover should be sown with the timothy or 
 orchard grass. The clover should be kept by itself, 
 and confined to fields or patches intended soon to be 
 broken up. 

There is another remark, however it may conflict 
 with preconceived opinion or established usage, a 
 sense of duty compels me to make ; and that is, of 
 all the time-wasting, land-cheating practices, none is 
 more to be deprecated than that of turning in green 
 crops, as a succedaneum for manure. In whatever 
 place this is practiced, however strong the land may 
 be at the start, the system, if persevered in, must in- 
 evitably bring the land, its owners and the country 
 into a state of poverty. No good husbandman would 
 think of pursuing such a course. Think of the time 
 lost in preparing ground for a crop, seeding it, 
 and instead of allowing it to mature, to be gathered 
 to the barn, ploughing it under, to serve as manure 
 to the land on which it was raised ! Manure, indeed! 
 To call the accidulated water, which the decomposi- 
 tion of partly grown clover, buckwheat, &c., produce, 
 manure, would be a misnomer — the calling of a thing 
 by the wrong name. Where a winter crop in the 
 spring shows unmistakeable signs of proving a failure, 
 a clever farmer should, and would plough it in, and 
 substitute a summer crop in its stead, so as to pro- 
 vide against loss of time producing, and to get what 
 he could for the manure he had bestowed upon the 
 winter crop the previous fall. It is intolerable, the 
 cant of want of vegetable matter in the soil.as ex- 
 cuse for turning in green crops. No soil that is well 
 supplied with barn-yard manure, and laid down to 
 grass occasionally through a judicious rotation, can 
 be destitute of vegetable matter. If the turning in, 
 year after year, scant crops of clover and the like, be 
 persisted in, the land so treated must, in a brief pe- 
 riod become not only destitute of vegetable mould, 
 but of every other organic ingredient necessary to 
 fertility. 

Two considerations should ever govern the practical 
 farmer. The first is, the absolute necessity of main- 
 taining his land in high condition — "good heart," as 
 it is termed. The second is, the system best adapted 
 to impair as little as possible the first or main object, 

through a judicious adaptation of crops, in view of 
 profitable yield, at the least possible loss to the soil. 
 In proportion as these considerations shall influence, 
 in like proportion will be the good or bad culture and 
 husbandry on the farm. 

To maintain land in good condition, there is no re- 
 sort within my experience equal to soiling, on old 
 well-cleared-farms ; if no other respect, the increase 
 of manure dropped in the stables and yard, at hand 
 for preserving, instead of its being wasted on the 
 lanes, fields, and ditches, would be sufficient to re- 
 commend it to the provident husbandman. This in- 
 crease of manure, giving increase of fertility to the 
 soil, and by consequence increase of products, is so 
 progressive, and mutually so self-sustaining to the 
 cattle and land, as to defy calculation. The enlight- 
 ened farmer, who has experimented on it, can only 
 compute or appreciate its multiplying results. It is 
 easier, however, to illustrate the evils of depasturing 
 exposed uplands, than to calculate the benefits ac- 
 cruing from the system of soiling cattle ; but the 
 one will in some degree unfold the other. Suppose 
 we begin with fifteen head of grown cattle, and in- 
 quire how many acres, under our fervid suns, would 
 it require to pasture them from May till November, 
 on fields of artificial grass, denuded before the pre- 
 vious winter had set in to impoverish them farther 
 with its killing frosts — the cattle to be turned out on 
 the first of May in condition as is usual in such 
 cases ? Why, not less than thirty acres. Now I aver 
 that five acres of well prepared land, near to the barn, 
 under patches of rye, clover, and orchard grass, lu- 
 cerne and corn, to be cut green, and fed judiciously 
 in the stables or sheds — the cattle having a spring in 
 some spot to be driven to for water and exercise — 
 would sustain these fifteen head of cattle better than 
 the thirty acres appointed for them to graze on. — 
 Here, then, is a saving of twenty-five acres of land 
 by this operation. And how much better would be 
 the condition of this land under grain, or grass for 
 mowing, than it could be under the continual biting 
 of the cattle, and the scorching heat of the sun ? — 
 And in how much better condition would be the cat- 
 tle, having plenty of juicy food, with time to rest and 
 ruminate in the shade, to that of ranging all day un- 
 der a burning sun, tired and fatigued in limbs and 
 jaws, gathering a scanty, scorched herbage, that but 
 mocks their restless cravings ? Add to this the quanti- 
 ty of manure that may be saved in these two months, 
 with the increase of dairy products, and you can 
 form some idea of the beneficial workings of the sys- 
 tem of soiling. It may be objected, that the additional 
 expense in wages or labor incurred in cutting and 
 feeding has not been brought forward. Well, let us 
 examine this item. These cattle must be turned out, 
 and brought in from the fields, daily to be milked ; 
 this, under the circumstances, by no means rare, of 
 the fields being distant and fences not very good, 
 consumes time and breeds confusion, from the fre- 
 quent interruption to other work having to be sus- 
 pended while looking after the cattle that have, per- 
 haps, broken into some forbidden field or thrown the 
 bars down. Then allow for so much time and labor 
 as is thus spent in the common way, and you have 
 to take into account only the additional unconsumed 
 time of a man or a well-grown boy, who would be re- 
 quired to attend constantly on the cattle while being 
 soiled. A boy who can milk, clean stables, mow a 
 little grass, clover or corn, wheel it on a barrow to 
 the stables, or hitch a horse to haul it, would be suf- 
 ficient for the undertaking : but even should a full 
 hand be required, the wages for two months would 
 not exceed thirty dollars ; but who would think of
