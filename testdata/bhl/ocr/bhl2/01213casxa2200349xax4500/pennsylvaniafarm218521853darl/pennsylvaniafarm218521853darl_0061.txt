■wages, when the work is chiefly getting manure for 
 the mere wheeling it out, as would be the case if the 
 stables be cleaned out as they should be, three times 
 a day. In this way forty to fifty head of cattle 
 might be kept for milking and breeding, upon any 
 commonly good farm of from seventy to one hundred 
 acres, admitting at the same time of more efficient 
 cropping, through a series of years, than if but some 
 eight or ten head were kept in the ordinary way, and 
 even these to be turned out on the roads and lanes 
 while the crops are in, as is sometimes the case, until 
 turned in upon the stubble and young grass with the 
 swine, so soon as the grain is removed from the fields. 
 The soiling should not be continued longer than two 
 months. The cattle from July should have the range 
 of the mowed grass fields the remainder of the sea- 
 son, with the stubble land in due time. In July, the 
 orchard, grass and clover, the best artificial grass for 
 hay and pasture, will be ready for second cutting ; 
 but no good husbandman, who values the condition 
 of his land, would think of mowing second crop — the 
 cattle only should cut it. Second crop makes poor 
 fodder, and to turn in the cattle so soon as the scythe 
 has ceased mowing either first or second crop, be it 
 meadow or upland, to exterminate the roots of the 
 grass during fall, completely denuding the fields 
 when winter shall have set in, is not only bad policy 
 but wasteful economy : an aci'e or more of turnip, 
 and other roots, would serve a better purpose for 
 winter food than second crop grass and clover. 

It is a reproach to Pennsylvania that her cattle 
 and dairy products should fall so far short of New 
 York. The census of 1840, if it can be relied upon, 
 with that of 1850, as far as has been given, show that 
 we fall below New York in dairy products about 
 eight millions of dollars annually. This is a large 
 item in one product, and is just so many millions a 
 year abstracted or lost to the income wealth of our 
 Commonwealth. Another item is no less startling — 
 it is, that New York produced, according to the form- 
 er census, twenty millions of bushels potatoes more 
 than Pennsylvania. The difference in dairy products 
 cannot surprise, when the difierence is perceived in 
 the quality of our butter and that of New York — I 
 alluded to salted or preserved butter for winter use ; 
 ours scarcely averages eight cents a pound — a consid- 
 erable portion of it sells from five to six cents per 
 pound lor grease — whilst that of New York averages 
 eighteen cents a pound. I have taken some pains to 
 ascertain the quantity of New York butter that is 
 sold annually in the Philadelphia market — some of 
 it, no doubt, consumed in Lancaster and neighboring 
 counties — and from the most reliable sources am led 
 to believe that it falls little short of two hundred 
 thousand dollars ! Here, then, is the money of farm- 
 ing Pennsylvania going into the pocket as it were of 
 New York, for butter alone, to the tune of two hun- 
 dred thousand dollars every year, to sayrnothing of 
 cheese and potatoes. Is not this startling, if not 
 shameful ? and should it not serve to rouse us to a 
 better sense of our own interests ? Now, a cow of 
 same breed and quality will cost as much in New 
 York as in Pennsylvania. The land and climate of 
 the latter are as good, if not better, than those of the 
 former. AVhat, then, makes the difierence ? Nothing, 
 but that the skill of the one in dairy products and 
 the management of cattle, is greater and better than 
 the other — a difference which we should endeavor, by 
 all means, to equalize at least. 

Tlie time I had intended to occupy has elapsed, 
 and therefore must bring my remarks to a close. The 
 preparation of the soil and adaptation of crops, with 
 their culture, are necessarily excluded. My principal 

object, as you may have perceived, was to promote 
 the furtherance of societies such as yours, believing 
 as I do that in no other way can the improvements 
 needed in culture and husbandry, on public conside- 
 rations as well as on individual acconnt, be so efiect- 
 ually accomplished as by a combined effort of enlight- 
 ened and patriotic minds, devoted to that object. — 
 One word as to the adaptation of crops to the soil. 
 There is scarcely a farm of any considerable size, 
 much less a district of country, but exhibits some va- 
 riety in soil, and which does notrequire a special and 
 judicious discriminalion in adapting the crops to 
 to its peculiarities. To follow, then, a common rota 
 ti )n, as if the soil of the whole were common or 
 equal, must end in disappointment to the hopes of the 
 f\irmer, and peculiar loss to the public in general. — 
 Whether from this, the waste of manure or the neg- 
 lect to husband it, or inaptness in resource, it is ap- 
 parent the lands are not as productive as they 
 should be. If they be ill used, wasted, or robbed of 
 their fertility, what is to become of Pennsylvania 
 when they shall not yield their adequate and natural 
 increase ? Thousands of acres of fine land are being 
 doomed annually to deterioration through a vicious 
 system, by their owners, who are little better than 
 cumberers of the ground, and by the destruction 
 wantonly perpetrated by the tenants. This latter 
 class are as wolves among flocks, ever prowling about, 
 and victimizing wherever they come. There may be 
 some honorable exceptions to this sweeping charge, 
 but it may be asked, where is the farm under rent, 
 for a few years, but has its character sunk and its 
 fertility destroyed? In England, and some parts of 
 Europe, this evil is well provided against by reme- 
 dies, founded as well on public policy, conservative 
 of the landed interest, as protective of private rights ; 
 and he who wantonly deteriorates the soil there, is 
 held in little less detestation than a public robber. 

If, in filling up the broad outline broached at the 
 beginning with such detail as in my judgment seemed 
 best calculated to subserve the great cause of Agri- 
 culture, I have drawn too largely. Gentlemen, upon 
 your time and patience, fidelity in purpose and zeal 
 in executing must plead my excuse for any seeming 
 difiusiveness. The attentive hearing, howejer, you 
 have afibrded to my remarks, loads me to hope no 
 other apology is necessary. One thing at least is 
 -certain, that I have fallen far short of the service I 
 could have wished to render to the cause your kind 
 partiality designated me to promote. 

Eai-1 of Seaham. 

This month we give a portrait of the distinguished 
 bull, Earl of Seaham ( 10,181.) lie was bred by John 
 Stephenson, Esq., of AVolviston, county of Durham, 
 England, and was calved April 21st, 1848, now three 
 years old. He was selected by IMr. Stevens, and was 
 imported by him and Colonel Sherwood. He was 
 shipped from Liverpool in June, and arrived in New 
 York in August. In one month after his arrival, and 
 before he had recovered from the eflects of his voy- 
 age, he was exhiliited at the Show of the New York 
 State Agricultural Society, at Albany, in September, 
 1850, and won the first prize as the best two year old 
 short horn bull shown. In October, he was exhibited 
 at the cattle show of the American Institute of the 
 City of New York, and won the first prize as the best 
 short-horn bull, in the aged class of short.horus, or 
 bulls tw ) years old and upwards. Seaham was 
 shown at the great show of the New York Agricultu- 
 ral Society, at Rochester, and won the 1st prize as 
 the best bull in class 1, short horns. 

Earl of Seaham is of the famous Princess tribe of
