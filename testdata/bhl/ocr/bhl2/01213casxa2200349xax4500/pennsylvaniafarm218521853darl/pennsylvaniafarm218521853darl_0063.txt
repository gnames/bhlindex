 Duchess of AthoU by Mastermann's bull (422)— 
 Beauty by Harrison's bull (292) — Tripes by the 
 Studley bull (626). Tripes was bred in 1748 by Mr. 
 Pickering, of Foxton, out of a cow which he bought 
 in 1739, when a calf, of Mr. Stephenson, of Ketton. 
 The female ancestors of Tripes had been bred by, 
 and in, the possession of Mr. Stephenson and his fa- 
 ther, back in 1684, in which year Mr. Stephenson, 
 of Ackland, Yorkshire, bought his first cow of the 
 Princess tribe from the Aislabie family, of Aislabie, 
 in Durham. 

The numbers refer to the Herd Book in which the 
 bulls are recorded.

THE HOMESTEAD. 

[see frontispiece.] 

The beautiful frontispiece presented in this num- 
 ber, is from Wheeler's " Rural Homes," published by 
 C. Scribner, of New York, and may be taken as a 
 specimen of the various elegant designs presented in 
 that volume. Although at first sight the design may 
 strike the reader as partaking too much of the an- 
 cient style, to become an American Homestead, yet 
 a careful examination of the details will remove this 
 objection. 

The plan of the principal floor is thus disposed : 

No. 1 is the entrance vestibule, with inner doors 
 shutting it out from the hall. No. 2. The vestibule 
 is twelve feet square ; the hall eleven feet wide by 
 twenty-five in length. This hall is lighted by a large 
 window looking north, and communicates through 
 an opening also shut ofi" by double doors, with the 
 staircase hall and vestibule No. 7. The main hall 
 would, from the nature of its light, be an appropriate 
 place for the hanging of pictures, and would be also 
 — as it should be — at all times a cool and agreeable 
 apartment. 

Immediately on entering the hall is a door leading 
 into the library, a large and cheerful room, twenty- 
 six feet by sixteen, on one side of which is a bay 
 window, and at the end a stone fire-proof closet re- 
 cessed and arched overhead, (No. 4,) in which books, 
 plate, or valuable papers could safely be stored. The 
 drawing room. No. 5, is entered from the main hall, 
 and also from the vestibule. It is twenty-six feet by 
 about twenty in the clear, and its one side is, by 
 means of large windows, made so as to be entirely 
 opened to the ombra. Connected with the drawing- 
 room is a small boudoir or ladies' room, being the 
 first story of the tower, and is thirteen feet square. — 
 The boudoir, drawing-room, and library, all open ou 
 to the ombra, a large and agreeable shade room, the 
 natural artistic development of the progress Irom the 
 ancient " stoup." This is a delightful place for sit- 
 ting in, and as an easily obtained addition to a suite 
 of rooms, cannot be too strongly advocated as a fea- 
 ture in American domestic architecture. It could 
 be enclosed with glass in the winter, and artificially 
 warmed ; thus used as an enlargement of the draw- 
 ing-room, or as a conservatory. 

The stair-case hall, No. 7, contains the principal 
 stairway, and also a double door leading on to a ve- 
 randa which might extend along the side of the house, 
 including the western side of the boudoir or not, as 
 seemed desirable. 

The dining-room, No. 8, is a large room, twenty- 
 four by seventeen in the clear, exclusive of the pro- 
 jecting western window. Communicating with this 
 is a waiters'-pantry, No. 9, furnished with glass and 
 china closets, and opening into a yestibule, No. 10,
