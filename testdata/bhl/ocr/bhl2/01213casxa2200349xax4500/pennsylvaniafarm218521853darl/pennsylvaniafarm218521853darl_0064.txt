THE HOMESTEAD. 

[May, 

in which are stairways, leading to the kitchen below, 
 and to the floor above, and also a door into the main 
 hall. 

I have in this design assumed that the land so falls 
 away on the northern side as to permit the kitchens 
 to be in a basement below, hence the arrangement of 
 the domestic offices is not shown ; but if more desi- 
 rable, they could easily be extended in awing jutting 
 out towards the north, and made to communicate 
 with the pantry as at present shown. The spot upon 
 which this design was studied had the ground so 
 falling away, and induced the arrangement I have 
 given. 

The chamber plan gives ample accommodation for 
 a large family, and with a due regard to rooms for 

guests. 

It is thus arranged : 

The staircase leada to a landing on which is a door 
 into chamber No. 1, over the boudoir, which, not be- 
 ing so high as the drawing-room, etc., is entered upon 
 a different level above, to that of the floor over the 
 main portion of the house. Above this is another 
 room of similar size, and then a space in which is a 
 stairway leading to the observatory or upper story of 
 the tower. 

Continuing up the main entrance, the vestibule 
 shown upon the plan is reached ; this is nine feet by 
 nineteen. A door in this leads to a large sleeping- 
 room. No. 2, the same size as the dining-room below, 
 and to which is a dressing-room, not shown upon the 
 plan, but occupying the place designated by No. 3. 

This room (No. 3), containing a bathing apparatus, 
 etc., is on a level with a landing on the servants' 

staircase, and is entered by descending a few steps 
 from the spacious hall or corridor over the hall be- 
 low. As this room need not be more than eight feet 
 high, a dressing-room might be contrived over it 
 from the chamber last spoken of, a step or two being 
 made between the floors. No. 4 and No. 5, are cham- 
 bers over the drawing-room, each of ample size and 
 well provided with roomy closets. 

No. 6 is over the entrance vestibule, and the re- 
 cessed closet below is thrown into the room, thereby 
 making it a very convenient shape for a bed. No. 7, 
 is a room the full extent of the spacious library be- 
 low, and over the bay-window, a balcony is obtained 
 entered from French windows. Nos. 8 and 9 are 
 closets. 

Above this the roofs would permit cool, well-venti- 
 lated, and large sleeping-rooms for servants, and it 
 will at once be seen that the provision for the repose 
 of guests is as hospitably ample as would probably 
 be needed. 

Triumph of American Skill.— Mr. W. H. Carr, 
 proprietor of Croasdale's Seed Drill and Broad Cast 
 Sower, has presented us with a pair of India Rub- 
 ber Pocket Combs, which are not only beautiful in 
 point of finish, but give promise of great durability. 
 So closely do they resemble the buffalo horn, that 
 the most practised eye would scarcely detect the dif- 
 ference. For this novel application of India Rubber, 
 we are indebted to Mr. Charles Goodyear, whose dis- 
 coveries of the various uses to which this gum may 
 be applied, have not only conferred additional lustre 
 upon American ingenuity, and immense benefits up- 
 on the community at large ; but have served to re- 
 ward him richly for his labors. The uses to which j 
 the prepared gum is now succeptible of application, 
 are said to be almost infinite.
