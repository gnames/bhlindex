[May, 

along the river bottoms has always been considered 
 the best ; but from close observation, I am led to be- 
 lieve that our yellovr locust vrill last equally as long, 
 even if grown upon a poor soil, and the sooner it is 
 used after it attains a size sufficiently large for posts, 
 the longer it will remain under ground without rot-

Locust Grove Farm, Lancaster: co., Pa. 

[Our correspondent's suggestions are worthy at- 
 tention, though we do not agree with him in regard 
 to planting locust trees along division fences. If 
 proper allowance is made for the dimuuition of 
 crops in the vicinity of the trees, the propriety of se- 
 lecting some other place will become apparent. 

The Acacia or Locust tree combines, in an eminent 
 degree, the useful with the beautiful. It is admira- 
 bly adapted to ornamental purposes, as well on ac- 
 count of the rapidity of its growth, as of its light and 
 pleasing foliage, and graceful, appearance, where 
 proper attention is given it. French writers highly 
 extol the properties of this tree, and assert that its 
 shade encourages the growth of grass. We do not 
 know this to be the case. If it is, the objection to 
 planting them along the division fences of the farm 
 would be removed. At all events, there are many 
 spots on every farm which might be profitably devo- 
 ted to the cultivation of the locust. 

We would here remark that the great difficulty in 
 propagating the Acacia, by young trees from the 
 nursery, arises from the want of care in transplanting. 
 The long cylindrical roots which it throws out abun- 
 dantly should be injured as little as possible, and as 
 much care should be manifested as in the transplant- 
 ing of fruit trees. 

The Acacia is also very subject to the attacks of 
 borers oftheClytus family. If examined in the month 
 of September, the trunks of the trees will be found 
 to abound in them, and the females busily engaged 
 in depositing their snow-white eggs in the crevices. 
 The eggs are speedily hatched, and the grubs burrow 
 into the bark, where they feed until the approach of 
 winter, when they become torpid, remaining so till 
 spring, at which time they bore through the sap 
 wood into the trunk. For a more complete description 
 of this destructive insect,with illustrations of its rav- 
 ages, and methods ol destroying it, see pages 65 — 66,

 Cultivation of Indian Corii. 

Mr. Editor: — The Farm Journal has made its ap- 
 pearance amongst us, and the favorable impression it 
 has already made, may be regarded as a guarantee 
 not only of its future usefulness, but of its more ex- 
 tensive and general circulation with our people. In 
 accordance with the request so frequently made by 
 you, I herewith transmit a brief account of what Ave 
 are doing in this neighborhood. 

One of our principal crops is Indian corn, which is 

cultivated to a considerable extent. My mode of 
 raising this valuable cereal is, to take a clover ley of 
 one or two year's standing, haul all the barn yard 
 manure, (long and short) I intend applying, on to the 
 ground during the winter and spring, and break up 
 the sod as early in March as the season will permit. . 
 The plowing is done as deep as a good team of horses 
 and the condition of the ground will admit. The 
 ground is then marked out four feet each way, and 
 the corn planted from the 10th to the 15th of May. — 
 My seed corn is prepared as follows : It is first soaked 
 in a strong solution of salt-petre for twenty-four 
 hours. A mixture of equal parts of tar and water is 
 then heated and poured over the soaked corn, stir- 
 ring the whole until every grain is well coated with 
 the tar. Plaster is then added, and the stirring con- 
 tinued until the grains separate easily. From four 
 to six grains are put in each hill ; and as soon as 
 fairly up, we put on plaster at the rate of a small 
 handful to each hill. We then go through it with 
 the harrow and cultivator alternately, five or six times, 
 thus effectually keeping down the grass and weeds, 
 which are apt to become troublesome if not attended 
 to in time. 

The average of my crop is about fifty bushels to 
 the acre; someof my neighbor's fields producing from 
 sixty to eighty bushels. I submit herewith a statement- 
 of the cost and profit per acre of cultivating corn iu 
 this vicinity, estimating fifty bushels as the average 
 yield. 

Interest on land, at fifty dollars per acre, $3,00 

Manure hauling and spreading, 2,00 

Breaking sod, 1,50 

Harrowing, 50 

Marking out and planting seed, 80 

After culture, 1,25 

Husking and hauling to market, 2,00 

$11,05 
 The whole cost of producing 50 bushels is eleven 
 dollars and five cents, or twenty-two cents per bushel. 
 We get forty cents per bushel for it very readily, leav- 
 ing a balance of nine dollars, clear profit, per acre.

 Plowing in Green Crops. 

In the address of James Gowen, Esq., delivered 
 before the Lancaster County Agricultural Society, I 
 find a sweeping condemnation of the practice of. 
 plowing in green crops for the purpose of improving 
 the soil. 

Notwithstanding the very respectable authority, I ' ' 
 beg leave to examine the positions taken in the fol- 
 lowing extract. 

" There is another remark, however it may conflictfi 
 with preconceived opinion or established usage, aT 
 sense of duty compels me to make ; and that is, of! 
 all the time-wasting, land-cheating practices, none is f 
 more to be deprecated than that of turning in green
