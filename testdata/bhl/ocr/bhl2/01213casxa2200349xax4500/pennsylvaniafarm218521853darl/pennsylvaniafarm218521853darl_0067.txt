crops, as a succedaneum for manure. In whatever 
 place this is practiced, however strong the land may 
 be at the start, the system, if persevered in, must in- 
 evitably bring the land, its owners and the country 
 into ? state of poverty. No good husbandman would 
 think of pursuing such a course. Think of the time 
 lost in preparing the ground for a crop, seeding it, 
 and instead of allowing it to mature, to be gathered 
 to the barn, ploughing it under, to serve as manure 
 to the land on which it was raised ! Manure, indeed! 
 To call the acidulated water, which the decomposi- 
 tion of partly grown clover, buckwheat, &c. produce, 
 manure would be a misnomer — the calling of a thing 
 by the wrong name." 

' In the country remote from cities and considerable 
 villages, tfce farmer can only obtain such manure as 
 can be raised on his own land, with the exception of 
 such as do not belong to the stable or barnyard — for 
 instance, Gypsum. Farmers near cities should not 
 forget this fact, and write as though exhaustless 
 quantities of manure w erewithin the reach of every 
 farmer. 

In view of this, I contend that the practice of tux'n 
 ing in green crops, especialy clover, should be en- 
 couraged and practised much more than it is. Let 
 a crop of clover, nearly approaching maturity, be 
 plowed into the land, and it must result in far more 
 benefit to the soil, than it could if gathered and fed 
 to cattle, sustaining them by the formation of bone, 
 muscle and fat, and, after unavoidable waste from 
 beginning to end, the manure carted back again to 
 the land. 

But Mr. Gowen ridicules the idea of calling the 
 green crop manure. 

Well, if it contains nothing but acidulated water, 
 how do cattle live and fatten, when fed on it, either 
 in a green state or dried, besides furnishing valuable 
 manure ? 

In this country, on some of our light lands, ?oe liave 
 to make a soil, and we do it by the use of clover and 
 plaster. "We turn under the clover, after being seed- 
 ed two or three years, and in this way soils that 
 would not, when new, bring more than two bushels 
 of rye to the acre, now produce twenty bushels of 
 wheat or fifty bushels of corn. Thus we obtain the 
 means of making a manure heap, which we do not 
 neglect to draw out and apply, while those who fol- 
 • low the skinning process, neglecting to feed their 
 I lands with clover, soon find themselves destitute of 
 any thing for the manure heap, and are ready to 
 seek the fertile prairies of the west, there to resume 
 the same exhausting process, on a soil able to bear 
 it longer. 

I regret that Mr. Gowen should have given the 
 wi'ight of his name and fame, as an agriculturist and 
 writer, against a practice so beneficial, (in a new 
 Country especially) as that of turning in green crops, 
 instead of greedily taking everything off the land, as 
 our most unsuccessful farmers here are constantly 
 doing. 

I hope that the farmers of Pennsylvania who read 

the journal will consider this matter; and that some 
 may give us their views and lessons from their own 
 experience on this subject.

For the Farm Journal. 
 Mules vs. Horses. 

Mr. Editor : — I was much pleased to observe in 
 a former number of the Farm Journal, a very sensible 
 article in relation to the more general use of the mule 
 for farming purposes. The reasoning of your corres- 
 pondent in relation to the economy of the use of 
 mules, as well as of the mode of treatment, is, I think, 
 conclusive, and should have great weight with those 
 who are hesitating about introducing them upon their 
 farms. 

Having for a number of years used mules almost 
 exclusively for the general purposes of my farm, I 
 cheerfully add my testimony to that of Mr. Mumma's, 
 in their favor. I am very well aware that it will be a 
 difficult matter to satisfy the Lancaster County far- 
 mer, who, during his whole life, has been accustomed 
 to the use and sight of his fine, sleek-looking, stout- 
 limbed, Conestoga horse ; that the more delicately 
 formed mule is at all adapted to his purposes. But the 
 day will come when this prejudice will be removed 
 and mules appreciated as they should be. It is, 
 indeed, a matter of no little surprise, that in this age 
 of improvement, our intelligent farmers should so 
 long have overlooked their merits. 

Mr. M. having already adverted to the advantages 
 which farmers would derive from the use of mules 
 instead of horses, I feel some hesitancy in recurring 
 to the subject ; but as it is one in which I feel inter- 
 ested, and in which your readers should also feel 
 interested, I hope they will pardon me for again 
 briefly pressing it upon their attention. 

My own experience, as well as that of every one 
 whose writings on the subject I have seen, satisfies 
 me, that the farmer, who substitutes mules for horses 
 will save in the first place at least one-half the expense 
 of feed. This is no small item when wheat commands 
 only eighty cents per bushel and corn forty. In the 
 second place, the attention requisite for the mule is 
 far less than that needed by the horse. By this I 
 would not be understood to say, that the care usually 
 taken of the former is what it should be. Their 
 superior hardiness and powers of endurance, are 
 frequently made the excuse for cruel and barbarous 
 treatment. Let the mule be as well cared for as his 
 wants require, and you have still a heavy balance in 
 his favor over the horse. Thirdly, the mule has the 
 advantage in longevity — only reaching his prime 
 when the horse becomes more than useless from old 
 ago. Fourthly, the superior hardness, healthiness of 
 the mule, and his almost total exemption from disease, 
 is another strong argument in his favor. 

Now, summing up all these various items, does It
