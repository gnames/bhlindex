 Fruit Growing iu Peiiiisylvauia. 

Mr. Editor : — Notwithstanding the excellency of 
 the quality, and the extent of the supply of agricul- 
 tural productions of the farms of Pennsylvania, there 
 are certain articles for which our metropolis is largely 
 dependent upon other States, and with which the 
 large cities of other States are more amply supplied. 
 In addition to these facts, the consumption of these 
 articles in Philadelphia is a large source of revenue 
 to the producers of other States ; all of which articles 
 the State of Pennsylvania is abundantly competent 
 to produce. The productions referred to are fruit, 
 and apples especially. The time was, when the city of 
 Philadelphia was abundantly supplied with apples 
 grown in its vicinity — these fruit orchards which flour- 
 ished for generations in the virgin soil, have become 
 exhausted, and there has been a criminal neglect in 
 not supplying their places by subsequent planting. — 
 The failure is a consequence of the exhaustion of 
 those particular elements in the soil congenial to the 
 production of the apple, and we are now dependent 
 upon other States for a supply of that fruit. The 
 same remark is true also with regard to the peach, 
 and so far as relates to the plum, the Philadelphia 
 market is comparatively destitute. These fruits if 
 successfully grown within convenient access to the 
 Philadelphia market, cannot fail to be a source of 
 profit to the grower. The apples of western New 
 York after being transported hundred of miles over 
 the canals, find a profitable market in Philadelphia 
 and London. 

Now it does appear reasonable, that with the 
 extension of our railroads through our wilderness 
 country, abounding as it does, in all the richness of a 
 virgin soil, and one of the best adapted in the world 
 to the growth of fruit; that the business of fruit grow- 
 ing in those sections would be one of immense profit. 
 These lands can be purchased for a few dollars per 
 acre, within convenient reach of the Philadelphia 
 market. We have glowing accounts of the profits of 
 the plum culture in the vicinity of the Huds n, and 
 there cannot be areasonable doubt that this fruit would 
 thrive equally well in northern Pennsylvania. The 
 plum is a fruit well adapted for carriage to market, 
 even where the distance is considerable. Many 
 varieties will remain sound and free from rot, a long 
 time after being taken from the tree, and always 
 command a ready sale in Philadelphia. 

As to apples, those cultivated for our own or a for- 
 eign market should be of the long keeping varieties ; 
 special regard being also had to the qualities of size 
 and taste. Many of the apples which are now found 
 in the Philadelphia, Lancaster and other markets are 
 apples in name and appearance ; but as unlike them 
 in taste as can well be conceived. Insipid and taste- 
 less, no lover of that valuable fruit would for a 
 moment encourage the cultivation of such varieties. 

There are varieties which not only keep well ; but 
 preserve their taste until mid-summer. These should 
 be chiefly cultivated. 

With the completion of the Sunbury and Erie Rail- 
 road, nearly the whole of the northern and western 
 counties of our State will have a thoroughfare to mar- 
 ket. Does it not therefore become a matter of serious 
 importance to the farmers in those sections to give 
 their attention to planting orchards now ? They will 
 find a ready market for all they can raise ; for when 
 the demand for our own country is supplied, the 
 markets of the old world are open to receive the sur- 
 plus. Western New York has already been pouring 
 large quantities of her superabundance of fruit into 
 these channels. Why should not Pennsylvania com- 
 pete with her, and thus add to the wealth of our 
 State by opening a new branch of foreign commerce?

 Why liCave Pennsylvania ! 

Mr. Editor : — Would It not be well if correspond- 
 ents for your Journal could be had In every county 
 In the Commonwealth, who would faithfully describe 
 the agricultural condition of their respective counties. 
 The importance of understanding thoroughly the re- 
 sources of our State becomes apparent when we look 
 at the tide of emigration tending westward, and the 
 character of those who emigrate. Many of them are 
 our very best farmers — men whose loss we are little 
 able to sustain at this time ; and who, perhaps, if 
 properly informed of the advantages which portions 
 of our own State oSer, would never think of leaving 
 it. Lancaster, Berks and other of our best farmed 
 and most densely populated counties, have furnished, 
 and are still furnishing, a large proportion of these 
 emigrants. Many parts of Ohio, Indiana and Illi- 
 nois, as well as Virginia and North Carolina, attest 
 the skill and enterprise of the Pennsylvania farmers 
 who have located within their borders. It is asserted, 
 by those who have visited them, that a settlement of 
 the hardy yeomanry of the Keystone State in the 
 west, is readily distinguished from those of settlers 
 from other States. The neatness and stability of 
 their dwellings, out-buUdlngs and fences — the char- 
 acter of their stock, and the substantial and comfort- 
 able appearance of every thing around them, all bear 
 testimony in their behalf. With these facts before 
 us, docs it not become a matter of general State in- 
 terest, to say nothing of State pride, to retain this 
 valuable portion of our population ? I think so ; and 
 therefore invite the attention of your readers to the 
 inducements which a portion, at least, of Centre and 
 Huntingdon counties holds out to such as may con- 
 template emigrating westward.

 quality as that of the famed valley of Pequea, in 
 Lancaster county, with improvements equally valua-
