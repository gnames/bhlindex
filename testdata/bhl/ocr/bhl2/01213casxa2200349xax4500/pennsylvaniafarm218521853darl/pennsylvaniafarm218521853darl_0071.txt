The Strawberry is at once the earliest, the most 
 exquisite, most salubrious, and most readily grown 
 of all fruits of temperate climes. At the same time, 
 no fruit is so little subject to disease or destruction 
 by insects ; yet, owing to its manner of growth and 
 bearing, a degree of care and culture is not only ne- 
 cessary, but indispensable. 

The Strawberry agrees with the most delicate 
 stomachs, and its free use is always salutary. Im- 
 mense quantities are grown near the cities and sold 
 at high prices ; an average of 200 bushels per day, 
 supplied to Cincinnati, only accelerated the demand. 

Most varieties of the Strawberry are of a dioecious 
 character; some are therefore positively barren, 
 while others, in favorable circumstances, are prolific 
 beyond any other fruit on the same area. The male 
 and female plants are distinguished by their blos- 
 soms,

In the perfect blossom, (a) the central part is the 
 germ of the strawberry, having a perfect pistil (short 
 tube ''or 'silk,') for each seed in the berry; the 
 small stems around it are the stamens. In the 
 male plant, (b) the blossom contains abundance 
 of stamens, but no (perfect) pistils. Varieties 

bearing such blossoms are worthless ; as they do not 
 produce fruit, their strength is wholly expended in 
 growth, and if present in a bed, they will soon over- 
 run the weaker fruit-bearing plants. The pistil- 
 late blossom (c) contains only the germ of the ber- 
 ry, with perfect pistils, and no (perfect) stamens. It 
 is usually smaller than the staminate blossom, and 
 looks more bare. Mr. Longworth's German vine- 
 dresser expressed the difi"erencc, by saying " de hus- 
 band, he have de beard, {stamens,) de frow, she have 
 none." 

The proximity of staminate or perfect blossoms is 
 essential to the productiveness of pistillate varieties, 
 and a small proportion in a bed is suflScient to_ en- 
 sure a full crop. Of course perfect blossoming kinds 
 are preferable for this use, as they will produce a 
 crop of themselves. Large early Scarlet is generally 
 used, as it is an excellent and productive sort, with 
 perfect stamens, and expands its blossoms early. 

This irregularity in the character of the strawber- 
 ry plant, (being partly perfect and partly dioecious,) 
 has caused much perplexity and controversy among 
 cultivators, and it is but lately that the true condition 
 of the case has been determined. 

Soil and Culture. â€” The best soil is a good free 
 loam, and it should be made deep and rich. Set 
 young plants either in August, if the weather is 
 moist, or strong (plants) in April ; if planted in the 
 fall, they are liable to freeze out, but this can be pre- 
 vented by pressing the earth firmly around them, and 
 covering well with leaves, or evergreen spray. In 
 cold districts, it is well to cover the beds with leaves 

or straw every winter. In 
 planting, the long fibrous 
 roots must not be crowded 
 together, or they will 
 mould and decay. To sep- 
 arate them, place a small 
 clod or stone {see fgure) 
 in the middle of the hole, 
 and set the plant astride 
 on its summit, spreading 
 the roots so as to depend 
 regularly around it ; then fill with fine mould ; water, 
 and if necessary, shade for a few days. If plants, 
 received from a distance, appear mouldy, rinse them 
 thoroughly with water, immediately before planting*. 
 Mulch well. The rows may be about 18 to 24 inches 
 apart each way ; sometimes they are left wider in 
 one direction to admit a cultivator. Every 3d or 4th 
 row or ?4th or 5tli plant should be staminate, if the 
 rest are pistillate. Iloe and suppress runners, and in 
 October work in a dressing of manure. _ The second 
 spring, hoe once and cover the surface with a mulch- 
 ing of leaves or litter. If proper kinds have been 
 planted, there will be a full crop. In October, dig in 
 manure as before. Dry weather at the season of 
 ripening, greatly reduces the size of the fruit. 

A strawberry plant fails after producing one or 
 two crops, it is therefore necessary to train a succes- 
 sion of new plants fur bearing. This is sufficiently 
 indicated by the habit of tlic plant, and its profusion 
 of runners ; the easiest method of affecting it, is to 
 di'i' under in strips the slants which have just borne 
 fruit, every year ; leaving equivalent strips of young 
 plants for fruiting next year; the growth and strength 
 of these will be greatly promoted by the operation. 
 If the bed becomes grassy, it is best to form anew 
 one, as the grass cannot be extirpated without inju- 

*AppleB gathered into large piles for grinding, have been pre- 
 served from decay, by pouring water on them weekly ; the fruit 
 being elevated on hurdles, so as to allow the water to pass freely 
 through.
