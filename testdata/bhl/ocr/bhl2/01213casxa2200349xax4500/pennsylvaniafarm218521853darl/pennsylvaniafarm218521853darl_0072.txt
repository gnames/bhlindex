 bed, of two or three perches, properly managed, will 
 yield an abundant supply for a family.

Tho. p. James, R. Sec. 

American Cutlery. — We have before us a pocket 
 knife of American manufacture, which for beauty of 
 finish will compare favorably with the finest speci- 
 mens of English cutlery. It is from the works of the 
 Waterville Manufacturing Company, located at Wa- 
 terford, Connecticut, and is another gratifying evi- 
 dence that American skill and enterprise are rapidly 
 outstripping the long vaunted superiority of the Eng- 
 lish. We have used pocket and pruning knives ma- 
 nufactured by this company, for several years past, 
 and take pleasure in commending them to public at- 
 tention. 

Hydropathic Encyclopedia, Fowler & Wells, New 
 York. 

The eighth and last number of this valuable pub- 
 lication has been received. To those who are desi- 
 rous of familiarizing themselves with the principles 
 of Hydropathy, this work will be invaluable. Every 
 page is replete with instruction, and may be read 
 with advantage by all. 

The Model Architect, E. S. Jones & Co., Philadelphia. 
 Nos.7,8 and 9 of this JWO(?eZ work has been received. 
 It is a credit not only to the publishers, who have 
 got it up in the most beautiful style ; but the designs 
 of buildings, details, &c., all evince that a master's 
 hand controls the work. 

Postage of the Farm Journal. — For the informa- 
 tion of all, we again state that the postage on the 
 Farm Journal, tf prepaid quarterly, is one cent on 
 each number, or three cents per quarter. Any higher
