500 AGENTS WANTED. 

We are desirous of securing one or more competent 
 agents in every county in Pennsylvania, to canvass 
 for the Farm Journal. Our terms are liberal, and 
 we are assured by well-informed friends in every por- 
 tion of the State, that competent and active agents 
 could not fail to succeed well. We therefore invite 
 persons desirous of taking agencies to address us 
 [postpaid) on the subject ; furnishing us with satis- 
 factory reference, and stating in what particular 
 county they are desirous of canvassing. 

New Cider Mill and Root Cutter. 

By invitation, on Saturday, April 24th, in company 
 with about fifty members of the Legislature, we call- 
 ed at the establishment of W. 0. Hickok, of Harris- 
 burg, for the purpose of witnessing the operation of 
 an entirely new Cider Mill & Press and Root Cutter, 
 the invention of Mr. H., and for which he has taken 
 measures to secure a patent. It is a small machine, 
 about three feet square, adapted to man or horse 
 power, very simple in its construction, but by a new 
 and peculiar arrangement of the cylinder, capable 
 of doing a large amount of work in a surprisingly 
 short space of time. A half bushel of apples were 
 placed in the hopper, and with one man power, were 
 run through in the space of forty seconds. The pu- 
 mace presented the appearance of having been grated 
 rather than ground. So complete was the process, 
 that the cider could readily be squeezed from it with 
 the hand. It passed directly from the cylinders to a 
 tub prepared for the purpose, which was slid under 
 the press, and in oiie minute the company were dis- 
 cussing the merits of the cider. 

Every one present was delighted, not only with the 
 cider, but the ease and rapidity with which it was 
 made. We confess that it surpassed every thing of 
 the kind we have seen. 

After drinking the cider, Mr. II. substituted an- 
 other cylinder, and showed the capacity of tho ma- 
 chine for cutting roots, &c. A peck of potatoes was 
 passed through it in a few seconds, and were cut into 
 pieces (not grated) of a size admirably adapted for 
 feeding purposes. In this particular, it commends 

itself to the particular attention of farmers. For fur- 
 ther particulars, we refer our readers to an advertise- 
 ment which will appear in our next number. 

We are requested to say that the machines are now 
 for sale, and on our own authority we state that the 
 price is within the limits of every farmer's purse. — 
 Patent rights will be for sale so soon as the letters 
 patent are issued, which will be in a few weeks. 

Economize your Manures. 

Notwithstanding the rapid progress which Agricul- 
 tural science has made, there is one point which never 
 has been, or is likely to be, attained — we have yet to 
 learn how to cultivate our lands successfully, without 
 the aid of manure. The introduction of steam has 
 wrought such an entire revolution in machinery, that 
 we may reasonably indulge the hope that sooner or 
 later it will be profitably applied to agricultural pur- 
 poses so far as plowing and many other of the 
 operations of the farm are concerned. The electric 
 telegraph has annihilated space and time — facilitated 
 the transmission of news, and materially changed the 
 character of many important departments of trade. — 
 But neither steam nor the telegraph have yet been 
 applied to the restoration of exhausted soils, or can 
 supply those constituents which continued vegetation 
 in the form of wheat, corn, oats, &c., annually take 
 from them. There is no soil, however fertile it may 
 originally be, that will for any length of time, bear 
 without partial, and often complete exhaustion, a sys- 
 tem of uninterrupted cropping. The deep rich soils 
 of the Western praries, the fertility of which was at 
 one time supposed to be inexhaustible ; and to which 
 for the first eight or ten years, the application of 
 manure is not only superfluous, but prejudicial ; now 
 give unmistakeable evidence of the loss of productive 
 power. Thousands of acres in Pennsylvania that 
 once yielded abundant crops, (but were robbed of 
 their very life by improvident farmers,) and which 
 are now regarded as waste lands; also, attest the neces- 
 sity of guarding against the future increase of this 
 gradual but, certain dissipation of our agricultural 
 wealth. 

If then manures are so vitally essential to the 
 maintenance of the fertility of our soils, is it not a matter 
 of the highest importance for every man who has an 
 acre of land to cultivate, to make himself familiar 
 with the nature — the best method of preparing — the 
 most economical plan of securing — and the most profit* 
 ablcmodeofapplyingthcm? The generality of f\irmcr3 
 never look beyond the mere products of the stable for 
 their supply of this all important material. They 
 appear to forget that they possess a thousand othei 
 sources from which fertilizing matter may b'e procured 
 in greater or less quantities. This should never be. 
 Every fiirm should boast not only a well cared-for 
 barn-yard manure heap, but, also, its compost heap 
 at every point where a sufficient amount of enriching 
 matter to form one may be found. Let the farmer
