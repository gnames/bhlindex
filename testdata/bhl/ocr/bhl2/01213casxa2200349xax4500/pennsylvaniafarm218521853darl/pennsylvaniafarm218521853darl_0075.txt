A Silver Medal awarded hy the Marijland State Fair.

Description of the seeding apparatus. A, is one of a series of 
 Iron Rollers or pullies, fastened to an Iron Rod or Axil, which re- 
 volves with the wheel of the machine j fitting to a curved and 
 grooved casting B, attached to the bottom of the hopper, corres- 
 ponding with a bevelled opening in the latter, through which the 
 ■eed is admitted and carried forward by the roller. The quantity 
 admitted is regulated by means of an Iron Rod along the entire 
 front of the hopper, to which all the sides are firmly attached and 
 kept in place by springs J. They are elevated or depressed by a 
 lever D, attached to said rod and opperates simultaneously on each 
 slide and groove. The lever D, is held in its position by means of 
 the catch I, having a series of teeth or notches. The roller re- 
 ceives the seed in proportion to the size of the opening in the 
 groove, and retains it by means of a cap F, in front of each, and 
 conveys it to the tube G, through which it is discharged, termina- 
 ting in a cone K, which scatters it across the entire furrow made 
 by the teeth or shanks H, in front, having a broad base of four or 
 more inches. 

The object of the invention is to secure an equal distribution of 
 seed in the drills either in ascending or descending hills; to regu- 
 jate the exact quantity sown per acre, to distribute and scatter the 

PREMIUM;STR AWBERRY "MO YAMENSING." 

THIS new and very superb variety raised by G. Schmitz, Esq. 
 near Philadelphia, and to which a special Premium was awarded 
 by the rennsylvania Horticultural Society, was purchased bv the 
 Bubscriber, and is now after a fair trial of three years, for the first 
 time ofl^red to the public. 

It possesses advantages over all others that 1 have as yet seen, 
 or cultivated — is rem^irkable tor its robust and vigorous growth — 
 perfectly hardy, enduring the extremes of heat and cold, is very 
 productive, producing a greater average of large berries from one 
 plant than any other, and nearly equal in size to the '' Hovey's 
 Seedling." Its great merit is its rich and high flavor, in which it 
 excels all others — it is much better adapted f<ir market,^(for which 
 purpose I am growing extensively) as its fruit is not so easily in- 
 jured by carriage. Strong Plants now ready for delivery at $2 per 
 doz., or $12 per 100. JAMES M. TAGE,

seed in the drill, from 4 to 5 inches in the ground, so that it will 
 be more perfect in its growth and yield more than if sown by 
 those in ordinary use ; in fact, possessing many advantages that 
 cajinot fail upon examination to strike all, as the accompanjiiig 
 certificates from competent judges and practical farmers express 
 it, as the best machine of the kind in use. 

The broad shovels and cones opperate in like manner as by mak- 
 ing the furrows with a hoe and sowing by the hand ; hence pecu- 
 liarly adapted for the South in sowing Rice. By elevating the 
 cones the machine sows ia a manner broad cast. 

We the undersigned, after using Mumma's Patent improved 
 Seed Drill, beg leave to recommend it to the public as one of the 
 best, if not the very best machine for the purpose, [as expressed 
 above,] that is now in use.
