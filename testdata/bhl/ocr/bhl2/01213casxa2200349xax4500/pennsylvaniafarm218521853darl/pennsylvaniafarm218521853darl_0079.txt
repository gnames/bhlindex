The Next State Fair. 

"We are much gratified in being able to announce 
 that the Executive Committee of the State Agricul- 
 tural Society have accepted the proposition of the 
 citizens of Lancaster, and determined to hold the sec- 
 ond annual State Agricultural Exhibition in the vicini- 
 ty of our city. A more suitable place could not have 
 been selected, and vre have no doubt that the choice 
 will give general satisfaction. 

The site having been agreed upon, the next duty 
 devolving upon the friends of the Society and of Ag- 
 riculture generally, is to sound the note of prepara- 
 tion, and get things ready for a grand display. The 
 annual Exhibition of the Society being a matter of 
 general importance, should awaken a feeling of gen- 
 eral interest. The earnest determination of every 
 heart and the untiring energy of every hand should 
 te directed to the laudable object of rendering it, not 
 merely the greatest Exhibition of the kind ever held 
 in Pennsylvania, but equal to any ever held in the 
 United States. The character and standing of our 
 Commonwealth demand this, and State pride should 
 respond to the demand. 

A laudable spirit of emulation will, we trust, per- 
 Tade every section of the State — emulation that can- 
 not fail to be a source of pure gratification and enjoy- 
 ment to all who strive to produce something that will 
 aid the advancement of the laborious calling of the 
 fiirmer. There is implanted in every true heart, an 
 honest ambition — a natural desire to excel, and to 
 awaken this praiseworthy feeling is one of the prin- 
 cipal objects contemplated by the State Society. The 
 field of competition is thrown open to all. By means 
 of such annual gatherings the knowledge of our most 
 successful farmers becomes common stock — the prop- 
 erty of all. He who has succeeded in producing a 
 better crop of wheat or corn than his neighbor — who

by study and observation has learned to understand 
 and practically apply the great fundamental princi- 
 ples of husbandry, and by repeated experiments, de- 
 monstrated the truthfulness of his investigation and 
 research, has his reward not merely in abundance 
 himself, but in the consciousness that he has been 
 laboring for the good of his fellows also. Such men, 
 actuated by such principles, are those who generally 
 stand foremost in enterprises of this kind, and who 
 by their noble example stimulate all within their in- 
 fluence to renewed exertion, and thus pave the way 
 for abundance and happiness to thousands. 

While, therefore, we are led to hope and believe 
 that at the coming Exhibition every county in the 
 commonwealth will be well represented ; we look for- 
 ward with no less anxiety to the position which Lan- 
 caster will occupy in the contest with her neighbors. 
 With an almost world-wide reputation as an agricul- 
 tui'al county — with the Exhibition at her very doors 
 — with ail the resources within herself necessary to 
 enable her to prove that she is worthy the proud dis- 
 tinction so generously conferred upon her, will not her 
 fiirmers, mechanics and artisans strive with all their 
 energies to maintain her high character ? Will not 
 her daughters prove that in all that relates to house- 
 hold economy they are neat, tasteful and industrious ? 
 Will not every one, whatever his profession, contrib- 
 ute his mite to swell the display, so that every depart- 
 mentof useful art shall be appropriately represented ? 

Fancy Farmers. 

The leading object with the largo majority of far- 
 mers, is, to make their profession profitable. Occa- 
 sionally we meet with one who cultivates his land 
 rather as a matter of relaxation and pastime, than 
 with a desire to increase his means ; but such cases 
 are exceptions. If then, farming is, as a general 
 thing, pursued with an eye to profit, it becomes a 
 matter of serious inquiry how this object may be 
 most efiectually accomplished. One of the secrets 
 which lies at the very foundation of successful and 
 profitable husbandry, is strict method in all the oper-
