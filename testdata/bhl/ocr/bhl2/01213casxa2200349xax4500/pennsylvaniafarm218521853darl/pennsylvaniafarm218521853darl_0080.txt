ations of the farm, coupled with untiring energy and 
 proper economy. The methodical tiller of the soil — 
 he who carefully matures his plans before putting 
 them into practice, weighing well the chances of 
 profit or loss — who calculates as nearly as may be, 
 the results likely to follow the adoption of a particu- 
 lar system; or in other words, the farmer who con- 
 ducts his daily operations under standingly, he it is 
 who has fallen upon the pathway to sxiccess. It is 
 amusing at times to listen to the self-satisfied projects 
 of men, who having become wearied of other pursuits, 
 look to farming as the last hope — the only calling 
 which promises reward when those already tried have 
 failed. They speak of it with all the confidence and 
 assurance of men whose whole lives have been spent 
 in tilling the soil — promising to themselves and their 
 friends such results as veteran farmers never dared 
 look for. AVith them, farming is the business of a 
 day. They talk of engaging in it, as men talk of 
 putting on a new coat, and without further reflection 
 invest their money in lands — plunge headlong into 
 the mazes of agriculture and in a few years wake up 
 to the mortifying consciousness of having most 
 egregiously mistaken their calling. Such is the brief 
 history of thousands of foolish men — men who have 
 never thought it worth while to inquire whether any 
 thing more was requisite to constitute them success- 
 ful farmers, than a certain number of acres of land, 
 and the necessary amount of stock and implements. 
 It is to such fancy farmers as these that agricultural 
 literature owes many of its opponents. Possessed 
 of neither practical skill or judgment ; with a shallow 
 smattering of book knowledge, their inflated boast- 
 ings of what they intend doing in the first place, their 
 spasmodic efibrts to make good their boastings in 
 he second place,and their complete failure in the third 
 place, disgusts the practical farmei*, and leads him 
 to undervalue the advantages which he by combining 
 the scientific with the practical, might realize. To 
 those who are desirous of adopting farming as a 
 profession, we beg leave to say, ponder the subject 
 well before you undertake it. Discard the idea that 
 every man is fitted to be a farmer. If you are of 
 methodical habits — economical — industrious and per- 
 severing ; if you are possessed of an investigating 
 spirit, anxious to know the why and wherefore — the 
 cause and efi"ect of things transpiring around you 
 daily — if you feel that having put your hand to the 
 plow you will not turn back again, then farming may 
 8uit you. If you possess not these qualifications, 
 take our advice and turn your eye in some other di- 
 rection, for there is no pursuit in which an indolent, 
 pleasure-seeking, unmethodical, merely theoretical 
 man is so little likely to succeed, as that of agricul- 
 ture. 

Organic and Inorganic Substances. 

The terms organic and inorganic occur so frequent- 
 ly in agricultural publications, that a proper un- 
 derstanding of the precise sense in which they are 
 used agriculturally, may be of service to some of our 
 readers. 

All forms of matter may be divided into two great 
 classes or departments, organic and inorganic. Un- 
 der the head of organic matter, is included " all such 
 bodies as possess organs, on the action of which de- 
 pend their growth and perfection." Thus the bodies 
 of all living animals as well as their dead carcasses 
 — all plants and thoir remains are to be regarded as 
 organic matter, having once been the seat of life. — 
 Any thing produced by the agency of living matter, 
 properly belongs to this class, whether it exhibits a 
 kind of structure, as in the fibres of plants and the 
 muscles of the animal, or whether, as in the bodies 
 of plants and animals which have undergone decay, 
 and where no evidences of structure remain. The 
 changes which various animal and vegetable sub- 
 stances undergo, when submitted to different pro- 
 cesses, such as burning, distillation, fermentation, 
 &c., do not destroy their character as organic matter. 
 Under the head of inorganic matter is included "the 
 solid rocks and soils, the atmosphere, the waters of 
 the seas and oceans ; everything which neither is nor 
 has been the seat of life." 

By a proper understanding of these terms, much 
 that is frequently difficult of comprehension to the 
 farmer unskilled in scientific terms, will at once be- 
 come perfectly plain. But in attempting thus to 
 render their true meaning as clear as is possible in 
 the brief definitions we have given, we have no de- 
 sire that inquiry should rest here. Every agricultu- 
 rist should understand, not only the difi"erence be- 
 tween organic and inorganic matter ; but he, should 
 be able to comprehend fully, not only what are the 
 constituent parts of animal substances, but of every 
 plant he cultivates. If this were the case, who is 
 prepared to estimate the degree of perfection to which 
 the science of agriculture might be brought ! And 
 yet, how few there are, who are willing to devote a 
 single hour or even half an hour of each day to the 
 acquisition of such invaluable knowledge.

Curculio or Plum Weevil. 

So formidable have become the ravages of this in- 
 sect, that many who formerly cultivated the difierent 
 varieties of plums, apricots, &c., have been compelled 
 to abandon them entirely. All the skill and ingenu- 
 ity of our most practical horticulturists has been ex- 
 pended in efibrts to exterminate this pest, but thus far 
 the curculio has triumphed. We should not however 
 despair of finally overcoming this foe to the fruit 
 grower. This can be done only by repeated experi- 
 ments, and unwearied efibrts on the part of those who 
 have sufiered or are likelyto suffer from their attacks. 

We are led to believo that the cause of the rapid
