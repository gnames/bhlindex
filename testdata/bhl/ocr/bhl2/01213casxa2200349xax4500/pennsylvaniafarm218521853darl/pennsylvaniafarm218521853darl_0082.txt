Salt and time Mixtureâ€” Decompositiou of Muck 

etc. 

Under the above caption there will be found in the 
 May number of 1852, at page 60, of " The- Working 
 Farmer," published at New York, and edited by 
 Prof. J. J. Mapes, an article recommending and giv- 
 ino- directions for the manufacture of the " Salt and 
 Lime Mixture," which I believe was originated by 
 the learned professor. He s^ys, " Common Salt is 
 composed of Chlorine and Soda, and when mixed 
 with Caustic Lime, is changed to Chloride of Lime, 
 and Carbonate of Soda." 

" The Lime having a stronger affinity for Chlorine 
 than for Soda,* combines with it, forming Chloride of 
 Lime ; the soda being set free takes carbonic acid 
 from the atmosphere and becomes Carbonate of Soda. 
 This rationale may be objected to by Chemists as not 
 strictly in accordance with the facts as to the origi- 
 nal composition of the Salt, &c., but they will all 
 agree as to the result, which is what the farmer re- 
 quires to know, and we have therefore adopted this 
 simple rationale." 

Without agreeing or disagreeing with the learned 
 professor, as to the original composition of the salt 
 (the which is a mooted question amongst Chemists, 
 and is likely so to continue) in order to be better under- 
 stood, I will give both the prevalent theories, and 
 leave the reader to choose for himself between them. 
 Chlorine Hydrogen. Oxygen Sodium. 

Chlorohydric Acid. 

Soda. 

Chlorohydrato of the Oxide of Sodium. 

Oxygen Hydrogen. 
 Water. 

Chlorine Sodium.

either side of the question, and that for my ovn yart 
 1 do not coincide with the supporters of either. 

The theory that I have adopted is represented by 
 the following formula : 

Chlorine Hydrogen. Oxygen Sodium. 

Chlorohydric Acid 

Soda. 

Chlorine, 
 Hydrogen, 
 Oxygen, 
 Sodium, 

form 

Chloroxide of Hydrogen and 
 Sodium. 

Chloride of Sodium dissolved in water. 

By these formula the reader will perceive, that all 
 Chemists agree as to the constituents and their rela- 
 tive proportions as found in common salt, and only 
 disagree as to the manner in which they are arrang- 
 ed. Some contend that the Oxygen of the soda com- 
 bines with the Hydrogen of the muriatic acid and 
 forms water, and that the Chlorine combines with 
 the Sodium and forms a Chloride. Others contend 
 that the muriatic acid is not decomposed but com- 
 bines with the metallic oxide and forms a true salt. 

As to this mooted question, I do not intend further 
 to discuss it, and will dismiss it, by merely saying 
 that strong arguments can be brought in support of 

*Lime has no affinity, (properly speaking) for Soda. They are 

bases, and both prefer the negative pole. Either will form a 

'tertium quid' with an acid, but when mixed they do not form a 

body, tlie chemical action of which differs from either of the in- 

redients. 

I believe the result of the mixture of muriatic acid 
 with Soda to be a compound in which neither soda nor 
 water nor Chlorohydric acid exist as such, but that 
 the Hydrogen and Oxygen are present in the propor- 
 tions capable of forming water, in the same way that 
 they enter into the composition of organic bodies. 

But that any such Chemical changes will take place 
 as described by the learned profession, it is my pur- 
 pose to controvert. 

Chlorine takes rank next to oxygen in the scale of 
 Electre-negative bodies, and Sodium as regards Chlo- 
 rine is more electro-positive than calcium, wherefore 
 unless it be an exception on mixing the solution of 
 Muriate of Soda or Chlorohydrato of the Oxide of 
 Sodium, or if you prefer, the Chloride of Sodium in 
 solution in water* with the Oxide of Calcium no 
 chemical change should be expected. 

But to bring the matter to a test let us try the ex- 
 periment. Take awine glass and put into it a portion 
 of lime water, which is a solution of the oxide of 
 Calcium, add to this a portion of common salt in so- 
 lution, and the two will remain suspended in the wa- 
 ter, without any perceptible change. But says the 
 learned professor, the soda will absorb carbonic acid 
 from the atmosphere and become Carbonate of Soda. 
 Not to wait this tedious process of absorption, take a 
 glass tube and exhale your breath through it into 
 this liquid containing the common salt and the lime. 
 The liquid will immediately become turbid and the 
 precipitate will be found to be Carbonate of Lime, 
 and the Muriate of Soda, or common sak,may be ob- 
 tained by evaporation, with not so much as a trace 
 of lime in it. 

And again, let the experimenter take a wine glass 
 and put into it a small quantity of the solution of 
 Muriate of Lime, to this let him add a solution of 
 Carbonate of Soda, and he will have a precipitate 
 which will be found to be Carbonate of Lime, and 
 the Muriate of Soda will remain in solution. 

This latter is an example of double elective attrac- 
 tion, or complex affinity. 

Carbonate of Soda being ] f Carbonate of Lime jj 

mixed with \ forms \ and

And again let the operator to a solution of Muri- i 
 ate of Lime add Soda, and the result will be Muriate ' 

*Or, as I would call it, the Chloroxide of Hydrogea and Sodium
