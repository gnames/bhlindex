of Soda and Lime. From these experiments we 
 learn that Lime has a greater aflSnity for Carbonic 
 acid, than Soda has, that Soda has more affinity for 
 Muriatic acid than Lime has, and that Soda has more 
 affinity for Muriatic acid than it has for Carbonic 
 acid. That the sum of the divellent affinities is 
 greater than the sum of the quiescent affinities, and 
 therefore decomposition must take place — and that 
 whenever such a state of things exists, there will be 
 an interchange of constituents. 

If such is the case,the Carbonic acid of the atmos- 
 phere in the learned Professor's process would go to 
 lime and not to the soda. If a solution of common 
 salt be poured on quick lime, there will be no change 
 other than that the lime will depi'ive it of a portion 
 of water, and if the mixture be turned over during 
 two weeks, to expose it to the atmosphere (as is re- 
 commended in the same article) the result will be 
 that a portion of the lime will be carbonated, and 
 consequently less energetic when applied to the 
 land. 

I can easily see that this process, if it would hold 
 good in practice, would be of immense benefit to the 
 manufacturers of Carbonate of Soda, and save them 
 untold amounts of outlay in the purchase of Sulphu- 
 ric acid ; and away with the necessity of calcination 
 •with Charcoal ; in other words, that it would make 
 a revolution in the modus operandi. But to the ag- 
 riculturist I cannot see its value ; of either of the 
 original compounds would be of as much, if not more 
 value to him before, as after the proposed chemical 
 change was affijcted, and he would have only his la- 
 bour for his pains.

But it is not merely by the application of manure 
 that the soil is to be replenished with matters suited 
 for the support of vegetation, but likewise by the de- 
 composition of the soil itself, which is greatly pro- 
 moted and facilitated by fallowing the land. For- 
 merly, naked fallowing was more commonly practised 
 than it is at present. It was resorted to regularly every 
 third year in course, with the design of permitting 
 the land to rest and recover strength for future crops. 
 Naked fallowing consisted in ploughing the land 
 thoroughly three or four times at short intervals, du- 
 ring the Summer, sometimes with and sometimes 
 without the application of manure. That land so 
 treated will soon, if not manured, produce increased 
 crops, results from the fact that the oxygen of the 
 atmosphere attacks all the substances with which it 
 comes in contact, and the carbonic acid it produces 
 co-operates with it, by rendering many ingredients 
 of the soil more readily soluble. Thus the decompo- 
 sition of solid substances proceeds regularly and 
 , constantly, though slowly ; and a portion of those 

decomposed substances is annually absorbed and 
 appropriated by the crops grown on the land. Ex- 
 cessive heat and cold also promote the requisite de- 
 composition of the soil. Frost serves to disintegrate 
 even the smaller particles of minerals ; and thus, 
 when oxygen and carbonic acid have acted thereon 
 from year to year, new surfaces and fresh points of 
 attack become exposed and the process of disintegra- 
 tion is renewed. Heat operates in a different man- 
 ner, but with the same beneficial results. It expands 
 all bodies, whereby they become more fully exposed 
 to the action of oxygen and carbonic acid. In ad- 
 dition to this, during a period of protracted heat ac- 
 companied by moisture, chemical action is increased, 
 and the process of decomposition goes on with accel- 
 erated rapidity. It is this decomposition and disen- 
 tegration of the soil which is promoted by fallowing, 
 and its effects are exhibited in the improved crops 
 which are produced after even a naked fallow. But, 
 notwithstanding this manifest improvement of the 
 soil, it was found that the product is greatly increas- 
 ed when manuring is combined with fallowing ; and 
 as increased consumption rendered an increase of 
 crops desirable, and experience showed that the 
 manure applied might be made available at once, it 
 became customary to cultivate various plants in 
 those fields. Thus the practice and system of culti- 
 vating what are called fallow crops, was introduced. 
 Under this system the laud is manured in the winter 
 and spring, and the cultivation of the crop at regular 
 intervals, is substituted in place of the ordinary fal- 
 low ploughing— whereby the decomposition of the 
 manure and the disintegration of the soil are alike 
 promoted and secured. It was further discovered 
 that larger quantities of manure might be thus provi- 
 ded and applied, because more food was produced 
 and a larger stock of cattle could consequently l>e 
 supported. Thus the entire scale of agricultural op- 
 erations became extended. Though the system of 
 naked fallows has in consequence disappeared from 
 practical culture, we should still be impressed with 
 the importance of its main and distinguishing fea- 
 ture — the frequent and thorough stirring of the soil, 
 for facilitating and promoting its disintegration and 
 decomposition, the benefits of which were never 
 more clearly demonstrated than by the fallow sys- 
 tem. These benefits result from the following prin- 
 ciples : A great portion of the stones in the soil is 
 composed of alumina with various combinations of 
 silicic acid with potash, lime, soda, iron and manga- 
 nese. Tlicse stones having become disintegrated 
 furnished the materials for the clay of the soil, and 
 by the further decomposition of the clay, the alimcn- 
 tal substances it contains, and likewise the silicic 
 acid, are rendered soluble and available by plants. 
 An exhaustion of the matters contained in the clay, 
 is certainly supposable ; but its decomposition pro- 
 ceeds so slowly, and the quantity annually with-
