drawn is comparatively so inconsiderable, that thou- 
 sands of years would be required to render the loss 
 apparent. Hence it follows that the clay must be re- 
 garded as the permanent source of the important ali- 
 mental substances required by plants. The means 
 to be used for rendering this source active, are ma- 
 nure and tillage. And on these considerations, also, 
 is based the principle that heavy clay soils require 
 more frequent and more thorough tillage than sandy 
 soils. Hence also, the obvious advantage of plough- 
 ing such land in the fall, as it is thereby enabled to 
 absorb more water, and is more fully exposed to the 
 action of frost. Equally important, likewise, is the 
 stirring of the soil during summer, because, by the 
 influence of moisture and heat the decomposition of 
 the soil is greatly facilitated. The more rapidly this 
 decomposition proceeds, and the more thoroughly it 
 is effected, the more richly will the soil become stor- 
 ed with soluble ingredients which operate as fertili- 
 zers. Decomposition, however, may also be promot- 
 ed by artificial means — as for example, in the case 
 of a clay soIl,j by the application of fresh burnt 
 lime. 

Finally, we have yet to consider how the alimenta- 
 ry ingredients of the soil may be most advantage- 
 ously withdrawn, and so appropriated that the par- 
 ticular crops which we desire to cultivate, may be 
 produced during the longest period, in greatest quan- 
 tity and perfection, and without requiring renovation 
 by the application of manure. This is to be accom- 
 plished by a rational system of rotation of crops, ju- 
 diciously adapted to the soil and the climate. The 
 chief principles on which such a system is based are 
 the following : The various cultivated plants, in gen- 
 eral, require the same alimentary substances, merely 
 in different quantities. Thus, for instance, one spe- 
 cies requires more potash, a second more lime, and a 
 third more silica. One species again requires more 
 phosphoric acid than another, &c., &c. Now, if 
 within a given period the particular crops cultivated 
 have withdrawn from the soil, its supplies of that 
 particular pabulum, or of those specific alimentary 
 matters which are essential to its perfect growth and 
 developement, it is evident that another crop of the 
 same plant, or of another species requiring the same 
 elements in like abundance, cannot thrive properly, 
 if it follow In immediate succession, unless, the soil 
 contain those elements naturally in great supera- 
 bundance, or they have been artificially supplied, 
 because In all ordinary cases a considerable lapse of 
 time is required to enable the soil to provide itself 
 again with the necessary stores of those elements, by 
 the natural processes of disintegration and decom- 
 position — a longer period, in fact, than usually Inter- 
 venes between two consecutive crops. Now, if the 
 deficient ingredients be not artificially supplied, in 
 the shape of manures, fertilizers or stimulants, there 
 remains no alternative but to allow the soil time 

enough to recover them by the gradual operation of 
 natural causes. Meanwhile, however, the land maybe 
 profitably occupied by crops requiring other and dif- 
 ferent elementary substances, such as the soil yet 
 contains in sufficient abundance. Thus the great ^ 
 waste of time and labor incident to a system of na- 
 ked fallowing, may be obviated by adopting a regu- 
 lar and rational system of rotation. But the decom- 
 position of the elements of the soil is promoted, not 
 only by selecting for cultivation such crops as re- 
 quire a different aliment from that needed and 
 withdrawn by those preceding, but also by choosing 
 such as require tillage during their growth. In a 
 rotati jn of cultivated crops, therefore, we must not 
 only be careful to select plants requiring ingredients 
 different from those taken up by the preceding crop, but 
 see that they are such as will secure the proper tillage 
 of the soil during the period they occupy the land, 
 and thus promote the due disintegration and decom- 
 position of the soil. But in a rotation of crops an- 
 other important point, besides, must be kept in view; 
 namely, the different degrees of vegetative power pos- 
 sessed by plants. The tenderest plants, and such as 
 have the smallest power of assimilation, or of absorb- 
 tlon by their roots,must be enabled to find correspond- 
 ingly more abundant supplies of soluble matter in 
 the soil. This consideration, however, is of less force, 
 and importance when the crops we cultivate are of i 
 species possessing greater vigor and increased power 
 of assimilation. 

In addition to these general principles of a ration- 
 al rotation, we must have special reference In our se-' 
 lections, to soil, situation, and climate. And to elu- 
 cidate these principles more fully, the following 
 examples may serve. Kecently manured land con- 
 tains a store of alimentary matters of various kinds, 
 sufficient to serve for a series of years. Some of these 
 substances are, from their nature, sooner exhausted 
 or withdrawn than others ; and this is more especial- 
 ly the case with the nitrogenous elements — ^these be- 
 ing very readily and rapidly taken up, in conse- 
 quence of their great solubility. From this cause, 
 also, some plants are very apt to become overcharged 
 with nitrogenous elements, which causes their con- 
 stituent matters, to be disproportionately combined. 
 Again, in recently manured land, the various Ingre- 
 dients supplied by the manure are generally not so 
 Intimately blended and mixed with each other and 
 with the soil as is desirable ; nor is the soil equally 
 and uniformly fertilized, so that some very poor spots 
 may not unfrequently be found in close proximity to 
 others highly enriched. And on the whole, during 
 this period, the manure itself, being as yet but im- 
 perfectly decomposed, operates with a considerable 
 degree of irregularity, according to the good or bad 
 quality of those of its ingredients which first came 
 into action. This is the reason why the soil, after 
 having been recently dressed with fresh manure, is
