valleys, the cooler hills, or the cold mountain range, 
 though I presume the former. We know that a va- 
 riety of our valuable esculents and plants novsr grow- 
 ing to perfection among us, were indigenous in the 
 tropics. Need we despair that the Peruvian tree may 
 be made to flourish as far north as Pennsylvania? 

Who is our minister at Bogota ? If you think fit 
 to publish, will you send him the number that con- 
 tains it, and request him to send you, for the Journal, 
 some account of the tree. Can it be propagated by 
 grafting? Can young trees be easily obtained? I 
 wish the government would direct inquiries to be 
 made of their agents in South America. 

[The above communication, without name or date, 
 was received sometime since. We delayed its publi- 
 cation expecting to hear further from the writer, but 
 were disappointed. We now present it to our read- 
 ers with a few remarks. 

The Cinchona tree is indigenous to South America. 
 The name was given it by Linnaeus, in honor of the 
 Countess of Cinchon, who first introduced the bark 
 into Europe. Numerous plants belonging to the ge- 
 nus have been discovered in various parts of the 
 world. Only a single species has been found in the 
 United States, the Pinckneya, which was discovered 
 by the elder Michaux, in Georgia and South Caroli- 
 na. Whether it prevails to any extent in those 
 States, or whether its bai'k possesses the virtues of 
 that procured from South America, we are unable to 
 say. It appears, however, from the best authorities, 
 that the genuine Cinclwna trees are found only in 
 South America, over which continent they are wide- 
 ly diffused ; extending from La Paz in the former 
 vice-royalty of Buenos Ayres to the mountains of 
 Santa Martha on the northern coast. Those from 
 which the best bark is procured, grow at various ele- 
 vations upon the Andos ; but seldom at less height 
 than 4000 feet above the level of the sea, and require 
 a temperature considerably lower than that which 
 prevails in tropical countries. This fact would seem 
 to favor the idea of our correspondent, that this tree 
 might be acclimated in the United States. We do 
 not know whether the experiment of propagating it 
 by grafting has ever been tried. Young trees, we 
 presume, might easily be procured, but whether when 
 procured, (even if successfully acclimated,) their cul- 
 tivation could be made an object, we leave it to those 
 more familiar with the subject than ourselves to de- 
 termine. — Ed.] 

For the Farm Journal. 
 Comparative value of the Oats and Corn Crops. 

Mr. Editor : — As the season is at hand when the 
 farmer is obliged to make preparations for his spring 
 crops, it may not be amiss perhaps to make some 
 comparative statements relative to the value of the 
 two principal crops, viz : corn and oats. 

My experience, based upon actual facts and calcu- 
 lations, warrants me in asserting that the oats crop — 

taking everything into consideration — will yield but 
 little over half the net income of the corn. Farmers 
 all know that there is a much greater risk with the 
 oats than with the corn crop. If the season is highly 
 favorable to most other crops, oats is in great danger 
 of lodging before ripe, and in that case, scarcely 
 pays for the hai'vesting, much less the seed required, 
 plowing, use of land, &c. On the contrary, if the 
 season is dry, it suffers more than almost any other 
 crop. 

Corn planted on the ground, usually reserved for 
 oats, if well cultivated will yield on an average sixty 
 bushels to the acre ; which, valued at fifty cents per 
 bushel, will amount to thirty dollars per acre. Oats 
 at an average yield of sixty bushels per acre, at thir- 
 ty cents per bushel, will amount to eighteen dollars 
 per acre. Here we find a balance in favor of corn 
 of §12 per acre ; which is a trifle not be overlooked. 

True, it may be maintained, that the labor required 
 for the cultivation of corn is a drawback, and it may 
 be further maintained that it does not leave the 
 ground in as fine a condition for the succeeding crop 
 of wheat. To which I respectfully reply : the value 
 of the fodder for feeding of stock over that of oat straw 
 will fully compensate for the additional labor of rais- 
 ing corn. Fodder is worth five dollars per acre at the 
 lowest calculation, when hay rates at ten dollars per 
 ton ; and we know that amount will pay any surplus 
 work, taking into consideration the small quantity 
 of seed required, compared with that of oats. Be- 
 sides, by planting an additional field of corn we re- 
 quire so much less hay ; and I am thoroughly con- 
 vinced that by raising a greater quantity of com 
 and feeding it along with the fodder on the premises, 
 thereby converting it into valuable manures, our land 
 instead of deteriorating will increase in fertility. 

In answer to the second objection, I will relate my 
 mode of management, and leave it to the reader to 
 judge of its expediency. I manure heavily the 
 ground that was corn the preceding year, in order to 
 give the seed of weeds on the surface time to germi- 
 nate — plow late — just before planting — roll the 
 ground with a heavy roller, to make it compact — 
 plant the corn in rows of three and a half to four 

feet apart, cultivate diligently, to keep ahead of weeds, 
 and in the fall cut it off at the ground, and carry six- 
 teen to twenty rows together. I then plow the in- 
 termediate strips that have been cleared, and gener- 
 ally, owing to the fact that it was heavily manured 
 in the spring, the ground is in first rate condition for 
 wheat. If the season is late and favorable, I fre- 
 quently husk the corn and the seed the narrow strips 
 on which it was carried ; if, on the contrary, the sea- 
 son prove unfavorable, I leave the strips until spring 
 and then sow them with oats. I will add, in con- 
 clusion, that wheat on corn ground has frequently 
 been the best and heaviest on the whole farm.
