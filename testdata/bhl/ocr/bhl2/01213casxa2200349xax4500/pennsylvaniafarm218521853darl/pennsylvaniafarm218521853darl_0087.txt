The above diagram will afford a pretty correct view 
 of the maimer in which the several strata of our State 
 succeed one another in a cross section from east to 
 west. The better to demonstrate the several forma- 
 tions, I have, as in the original sketch by Professor 
 Rogers, retained the Atlantic or New Jersey section, 
 which shows the tertiary and cretaceous deposits of 
 that State and which adapt the soil in an eminent 
 degree, lor many products cultivated there with great 
 success, such as melons, cantelopes, sweet potatoes, 
 garden vegetables, and several kinds of delicate fruits 
 especially peaches. 

This section is very properly termed the Atlantic 
 plain, and extends along the coast from Long Island 
 to Louisiana both inclusive. 

The next or Atlantic Slope includes in our State 

the primary rocks already described, and the New 
 Bed Sand Stone formation â€” the former termed by Mr. 
 Lyell hypogene. The latter forms a most interesting 
 and important district extending continuously from 
 the Raritan bay to the centre of Virginia. The same 
 formation is also largely developed on the Connecti- 
 icut river. It is remarkably uniform in materials and 
 appearance, consisting of dark-reddish brown sand- 
 stone, almost invariably argilaceous ; of soft crumbly 
 brown shales, and coarse calcareous or silicious con- 
 glomerates. The dip of the strata is generally toward 
 the northwest at angles varying from fifteen to twen- 
 ty-five degrees. 

Doubtless many of your readers living within the 
 lines of this belt would like to have its limits defined, 
 and I shall therefore give them, as detailed in the re- 
 port by the State geologist, of the region between the 
 Delaware and Susquehanna rivers. "Its southern 
 margin crossing the river about a mile and a half 
 above the city of Trenton, runs nearly westward to 
 the Schuylkill passing about two miles south of Nor- 
 ristown ; it there extends by Valley Forge and Kim- 
 berton to French creek, the course of which it follows 
 nearly to the county line of Chester. It passes about 
 half a mile to the north of Morgantown, Churchtown 
 and Hinkletown, and goes through Millport to Bu- 
 chan's run where it suddenly folds back and runs to- 
 wards the northeast, through Ephrata to lleamstown. 

From the last point it sweeps in a regular curve, 
 first towards the northwest and afterwards the south- 
 west, crossing the turnpike at ^liddle creek. Reach- 

ing Hammer creek, it descends along the course of 
 this stream to Erb's Mill, where it turns again west- 
 ward, passing about a mile to the northward of Litiz, 
 reaches in the same course Manheim. Here it goes 
 once more towards the east, which direction it pur- 
 sues as far as Buchan's run, where, however, it again 
 turns westward, continuing in that course uninter- 
 ruptedly to Springfield, at which place it makes an- 
 otherjshort flexure but soon resumes its western range, 
 passing one and a half miles south of Elizabethtown, 
 and thence nearly in a straight line south-westward 
 to Bainbridge on the Susquehanna. 

From the Delaware river at Trenton to the War- 
 wick mine, near the head waters of French creek, the 
 red sandstone stratum overlaps the gneiss and other 
 rocks of the primary class. From the latter point it 
 ranges in contact with the white sandstone of the 
 Welsh mountain, but on entering Berks county and 
 in its course across the whole length of Lancaster 
 county, its southern margin is everywhere injunction 
 with the limestone. 

The northern border of this formation beginning 
 at the Delaware near Durham, if traced westward 
 across our district, will be found to pass about one 
 mile south of Springtown, and one mile north of Coop- 
 erstown to the Ilosacock creek, where the road cross- 
 es it in Upper Milford township. It then runs a little 
 to the south of Mount Pleasant iron mines, passes 
 Boycrstown, crosses the Perkiomen one mile south 
 of Black Bear tavern, and meets the Schuylkill about 
 two miles south of Reading. The Potomac marble 
 or calcareous conglomerate, occupies several long nar- 
 row tracts along the line just traced; one a little be- 
 low Springtown ; another on the Manatawny creek, 
 and a third on the Limekiln creek. It also occurs 
 on the Schuylkill below Reading. From this point, 
 the northern edge of the sandstone stratum extends, 
 with slight undulation, in a nearly western direction 
 to the south- western end of IMillborough hill, over- 
 lapping first, the limestone of the Kittatinny valley; 
 then primary rocks, and finally the white sandstone 
 of this hill. From Millborough hill it ranges a little 
 south of west through Sheafferstown, past the Corn- 
 wall iron works and thence along the turnpike to 
 Campbcllstown, from which it takes nearly a straight 
 course to Highspire on the Susquehanna. Between 
 Millborough hill and the Susquehanna, the red sand-
