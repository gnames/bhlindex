stone lies everywhere in contact with the limestone 
 of the Kittatinny valley." 

This interesting district is one of the most highly 
 cultivated portions of the State, the soft and pulveru- 
 lent nature of the soil rendering tillage comparatively 
 easy. Indian corn, wheat, and other cerealia yield 
 abundantly, and the soil is better adapted to the ar- 
 tificial than the natural grasses, the primary forma- 
 tions evidently affording the proper pabulum for the 
 latter. 

The Red sandstone belt is rich in minerals, although 
 they have not, with some exceptions, been actively 
 wrought until within a year or two. 

Iron ore of excellent quality is found in several lo- 
 calities; copper, lead, and silver also abound, and 
 there is reason to believe that the recent efforts to 
 mine them on an extensive scale will prove success- 
 ful. The variegated or conglomerate marble being 
 similar to that of which the columns of the capitol at 
 Washington are formed, is probably susceptible of 
 being polished, and is well worthy the attention of 
 builders and architects. 

In the primitive and sandstone series are several 
 extensive exposures of basaltic or trap dykes, such as 
 are shown on the diagram of the Isle of Arran. — 
 These rocks are extensively displayed on the Harris- 
 burg railroad near Elizabethtown. Although very 
 hard, the soda and oxyde of iron in them promotes 
 disintegration, as may be observed by their rounded 
 and worn surfaces, and also the numerous cracks and 
 fissures that are found in them. 

Relics of vegetation are sometimes found in the red 
 sandstone strata in the form of compact bituminous 
 lignite, bearing a strong resemblance to cannel coal, 
 but the hopes they excite are entirely delusive. 

The formations west of the new red sandstone and 
 extending from the eastern base of the ridges, which 
 compose the South mountains to the crest of the Sharp 
 mountain, are the lower secondary of Prof. Rogers 
 or the Silurian and Devonian of English geologists. 
 This range embraces the great Kittatinny, Lebanon, 
 Cumberland and other limestome valleys, famous for 
 their fertility, and high state of cultivation. There 
 is also within this range a great amount of Oline col- 
 oured argillaceous sandstone and red shales, which 
 are poor and unproductive on the high ridges but ma- 
 king a very good soil in the valleys and plains — a 
 soil that is readily cultivated, and in most cases great- 
 ly improved by the addition of lime. 

There is indeed a larger proportion of land in Penn- 
 sylvania capable of being brought into profitable use 
 than in any other of the Atlantic States; such at least 
 was the opinion of Wm. Maclure the able>nd accur- 
 ate pioneer of American geology. He says that 
 "Pennsylvania consists principally of transition and 
 secondary, having the smallest quantity of the primi- 
 itive class of any State east of the mountains, and 
 most probably the greatest quantity of good land, in 

proportion to its surface of any of the Atlantic States." 
 In this group or series there are fewmetalic substan- 
 ces yet discovered except iron, which abounds in al- 
 most every formation, within the State, and perhaps 
 is more generally diffused than in any other known 
 country of the same extent. The great source of fer- 
 tility and wealth however in this region is lime, and 
 to this mineral production under the hand of skill 
 and industry, is due the high reputation of Pennsyl- 
 vania farms. It is proper to note here that the lime- 
 stone of the primary series is highly magnesian ; that 
 of the lower secondary less so ; and that of the upper 
 secondary or later formations still less intermingled 

with magnesia. 

Formerly it was supposed that this ingredient in 

limestone was deleterious to vegetation, but modern 
 experience has proved the contrary, and that it is 
 only necessary to use the magnesian limestone or do- 
 lomite in smaller quantities than the pure carbonate 
 of lime. A. S. Roberts.

Mr. Editor : — I have been a reader of your excel- 
 lent Agricultural Journal for one year, and am much 
 pleased with its manner and its matter I hope it wiU 
 be sustained, as it will certainly be highly useful in 
 this State. I have often thought of corresponding 
 with you, but like hundreds of others, handle the 
 plough better than the pen. I will, however, give 
 you a few crude ideas on farming, or rather on the 
 contents of yovir last Journal. 

The first article in your April number is on the 
 protection of sheep. I agree with the writer — a good 
 revenue might be raised by taxing dogs, and no one 
 injured by it. A farmer should not be kept in fear 
 of losing his flock of sheep, or perhaps prevented from 
 keeping sheep altogether, to accommodate his neigh- 
 bor with one, two or three worthless curs, which even 
 though harmless, are still a great loss to the owner. 
 I am fond of a good dog, and keep two ; and feel that 
 I ought to be made pay tax for one certainly, as he is 
 of no use, and it costs me as much to feed him as it 
 would to fatten a good hog. This is every man's expe- 
 rience who keeps dogs. 

Your article on the first page relative to farmers, 
 is in my opinion not correct. I know that it is com- 
 mon to preach up the profits of small farms, and con- 
 demn the culture of large ones. This is entirely a 
 matter of circumstance. If a farmer can do all his 
 labor with his own hands, or with the help of his 
 wife and children, so as not to be compelled to hire 
 help, then he should have a farm proportioned to his 
 abilities ; but if a farmer hires all his laborers, he 
 cannot make money enough to pay them and his
