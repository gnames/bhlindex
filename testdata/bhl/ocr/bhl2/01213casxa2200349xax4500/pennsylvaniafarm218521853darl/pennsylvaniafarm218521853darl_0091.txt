productions of the dairy, &c., rather than the fine 
 horses, cattle and agricultural implements, still I 
 cannot but feel, (and I think you will agree with me) 
 that no part of the coming exhibition should be more 
 fully represented than that appropriated to the la- 
 dies. Loudly as poets and authors generally, extol 
 the character of American women and boast the su- 
 perior deference paid them by the other sex, I fear 
 that they are rapidly forfeiting their claims to this 
 marked respect. By this I do not mean to say that 
 they are any less virtuous or intelligent than former- 
 ly ; but I do assert that the women of the present 
 day (the yonng women I mean) are far more indo- 
 lent than those of twenty or thirty years since. Thei-e 
 was a time, and I remember it well, (for I am now 
 on the shady side of fifty) when young women, and 
 especially farmer's daughters, were taught to rise 
 with the lark, to spin, sew, knit, milk the cows, 
 churn the butter, feed the chickens, and attend to the 
 duties of the household generally. Clear complex- 
 ions and taper fingers were not considered as essen- 
 tial to a young lady then, as now. Rosy cheeks, and 
 hands that bore the marks of honest industry, were 
 deemed no disgrace, and the comforts of the house- 
 hold in the form of home made linens of snowy 
 whiteness, quilts and counterpanes of elaborate 
 workmanship, comfortable woolen hose and gloves 
 for fathers and brothers, and the substantial provis- 
 ions of the table in the form of golden butter, nice 
 white bread, newly laid eggs, tender chickens, and 
 the products of a well tilled garden claimed their 
 first attention. How is it now ? How will the girls 
 of the present day compare with those of twenty 
 years since ? How many of them ever see the sun 
 rise, knit their own stockings, make their own quilts, 
 or attend to any other duties than those of keeping 
 the parlors clean, and playing the agreeable to young 
 men who are about as industrious and useful as 
 themselves ? Reform is needed, and one of the most 
 effectual steps towards such a reformation lies in the 
 coming State Exhibition. Let the department of fe- 
 male industry occupy a permanent place. Let the 
 premiums be sufficiently large to induce active com- 
 petition, and above all, let there he a committee of 
 Women to decide upon the merits of the articles exhib- 
 ited. By thus fostering a spirit of emulation amongst 
 the young women, much good may result, and the 
 foundation be laid for a return to those industrious 
 and economical habits which characterized the girls 
 of twenty years since. Excuse my plain style of 
 writing and old fashioned way of thinking.

For the Farm Journal. 
 The house or clothes Moth. 

Swatara Falls, March 22, 1852. 
 Mr. Editor : — Will yoube kind enough to describe 
 the character and habits of the provoking, and fre- 
 quently destructive insect (commonly^ called house 
 moth) with which every housekeeper is more or less 
 troubed in this country ; any information you may be 
 kind enough to communicate through the Farm 
 Journal, (on the manner and process by which 
 the insect is propagated, the various tranformations 
 through which it passes, what state it is in when it 
 commits its ravages on everything woolen it comes 
 in contact with, and what is the best preventative, 
 &c.,) will be thankfully received by many of your 
 subscribers. David Mumma. 

Bark Bound Trees. — Scrape with a knife and 
 wash with very strong soap suds, once or twice during 
 a season, and the cure will in all probability be ef- 
 fected ; if not tie long straw around the trunk of the 
 tree, which is said to be an effectual cure. 

Mr. Editor : — The " house moth" alluded to by 
 your correspondent, belongs to a very extensive fam- 
 ily (Tineidse) of minute Lepidopterous insects,- most 
 of which in their imago or perfect state are distin- 
 gushed by their narrow wings, with a plain margin 
 (entire) twisted spirable around the body (convoluted) 
 when in a state of repose ; bodies generally long and 
 slender ; antenne of moderate length, either simple 
 in both sexes, or coated with fine soft hair beneath, 
 (pubescent)in the males : eyes and palpi prominent. 
 The larvae are generally naked or slightly hairy, 
 many undergoing their transformations in portable 
 cases, formed of the various material upon which 
 they feed, and consequently, it is in that state that 
 many of them perpetrate and continue their work of 
 destruction, attacking woolen material of every de- 
 scription, furs, skins, &c., and if pressed with hunger 
 will even eat horse hair* and cotton goods, out of which 
 they also construct their habitations. 

As soon as the larvoe of the clothes moths (Tinea) 
 are excluded from the eggs, (which have been pre- 
 viously deposited by the parent female upon the 
 material affording food appropriate to the species) 
 they commence forming cases suited to the size of 
 their bodies, out of filaments of wool, which they cut 
 close to the thread of the cloth, and after felting them 
 together, they carefully line the inside with a coat of 
 fine silk which they spin from their mouth in the 
 same manner that the silkworm (Bombyx mori) does. 
 Extreme necessity alone can compel them to leave 
 these cases when once formed and inhabited. When 
 they want to feed, they put out their head from either 
 end of the case as may seem most convenient, which 
 apparently for that purpose, has been left open. — 
 When inclined to move, the head and about half the 
 body is protruded, thus they move forward dragging 
 the case along with them by fixing the hinder legs 
 (posterior prologs) firmly in the inside : these being 
 surmounted by a cornet of little hooks (as all Lepi- 
 dopterous larv{c arc) for that purpose form very effi-
