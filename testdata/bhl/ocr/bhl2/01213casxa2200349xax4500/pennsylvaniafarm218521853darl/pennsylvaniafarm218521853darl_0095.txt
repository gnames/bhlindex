A SEPARATE PLACE FOR EACH THING, AND EVERY THING IN ITS PLACE. 

I 

mirably adapted to their end I — the order — the regu- 
 larity — the wonderful economy ! nothing in vain — 
 nothing wasted — nothing lost! 

But you say you have not time to attend to these 
 things: are you aware how much of your time, as well 
 as your property, will be saved in the end? In la- 
 borious matters we may be industrious, and yet omit 
 small ones through negligence. 

You rise early of course, but is all your time em- 
 ployed to the best advantage? Do you note the frag- 
 ments of it that are wasted by yourselves, and those 
 around you? You see then it is not for want of time ; 
 it is for want ot properly employing it — it is fur want 
 of method; and no one can fill up the full measure of 
 his usefulness without it. You are saving of your 
 money, then why not economize your time. 

We should all remember that it is our dnty, and 
 indeed our interest, to instruct others as well as to 
 improve ourselves; and it may be truly said, that he 
 who can accomplish and teach others to perform with 
 ease a double amount of duty, is as much a benefac- 
 tor as he who causes the ''two blades of grass to 
 grow where but one grew before." To assist you in 

the object contemplated, provide a small book witli 
 but two leaves, and as they occur to you, note in such 
 little matters as may require care ; you will then be 
 able to attend to many things which are now neglec- 
 ted, because not thought of at a leisure time. But 
 this book must be examined daily, and cleaned up a.s 
 often as possible; for if the items are suffered to ac- 
 cumul ite, the book will lose its virtue. 

Are there not some other things to be looked after? 
 Where are your implements of labor — your ploughs ; 
 your harrows ; your hoes and your shovels ; your 
 forks ; your rakes and scythes ? Are they in good 
 condition, and in th.ir proper places; or are they ex- 
 posed to the weather, and some of them mislaid or 
 lost? 

Have you a tool-house? Have you a work-shop? 
 If 3'ou have not, there must then be some disorder ; 
 and is not that the cause? For a deficiency of care 
 in one respect generally leads to it in others ; and it 
 is the hibit of care you must acquire. 

Would you know the secret of having things keep 
 in their plares'^ then provide suitable places for them, 
 and have a distinct and separate place for each.
