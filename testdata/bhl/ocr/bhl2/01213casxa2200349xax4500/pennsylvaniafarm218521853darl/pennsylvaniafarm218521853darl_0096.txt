But these places must be convenient and easy of 
 access; and the articles must be arranged withsome 
 taste, and so as to produce a pretty efiect. This will 
 be pleasant to the eye, and will awaken a feeling of 
 interest in those in your employ, and each one will 
 take pleasure in promoting the object. To ensure 
 success, however, you must go further. You must 
 mark in outline the exact shape of each article upon 
 the wall or partition against which it may be placed. 
 Try it and you will be astonished at the result; it will 
 act like a charm in restoring things to their places. 
 And from it you will derive a further advantage, as 
 you will thereby be enabled at a glance to see exact- 
 ly what implements and tools belong to you, and 
 more pains will be taken to keep them fit for use. — 
 And if at any time they should be left out of place, 
 or be lent to a careless neighbor, you will be contin- 
 ually reminded of it until they are returned, and thus 
 often saved from loss. 

The good effects of this plan will not stop here, for 
 its successful operation will be a valuable example in 
 the neighborhood, and a practical illustration of the 
 beauty and usefulness of order. 

It will also serve to fix in the minds of those about 
 you, a 2-)rinciple applicable in various other forms, 
 and it will gradually produce an effect upon their 
 habits that will, more or less, influence all their con- 
 duct. MlQUON. 

Note. — The diagram at the head of this artic'e is a 
 copy of a closet recently fitted, and comprises most of 
 the tools that would be needed for a family. For a 
 farmer, a greater variety would of course be required. 
 But the design of the plate, is to show that any set 
 of tools or implements may be so arranged as to pre- 
 sent a symmetrical and tasteful appearance ; by se- 
 lecting some prominent article as a point or centre, 
 and radiating, or otherwise arranging the others 
 around it. 

The tools are secured in their places by staples 
 made of wire, and by small brass or iron hooks, or 
 by nails. One of the awl handles is hollow, and con- 
 tains about a dozen blades of different shapes, each 
 of which will fit firmly into the other handle. The 
 shape of the tools as there represented, was marked 
 out by a small stiff brush, and with ink. The cost 
 of the tools at retail price, was $8 67. 

For the Farm Journal. 
 The Best Plough for General Farming Purposes. 

Mr. Editor : I take the liberty of enquiring 
 through the medium of your valuable "Journal" for 
 information in regard to the selection of the best 
 Plough for general farming purposes. I suppose you 
 or many of your contributors to the " Journal" be- 
 ing practical Agriculturists could give the necessary 
 information. The soil in this region of country is 
 of rather a sandy nature, not having very stiff sward 
 in general. The best plough we have is R. Hall's 
 Patent. (Pittsburg) I think this plough rather heavy, 
 especially for light soil. 

Yours, with respect,

l^PawUng^s Plow, manufactured in Montgomery 
 CO., Pa.; Proulty & Mears No. 5 J and 45, as well as 
 several other kinds manufactured by the same firm ; 
 Planlc's Cutter Plow, manufactured in Cumberland 
 CO.; Cnsslei-'s Plow, in the same co.; the Wiggin's 

Plow, manufactured by Geo. Buckman, Pineville, 
 Bucks CO.; Minrdch's Plow, manufactured by John 
 Minnich, Mechanicsville, Lancaster co., are all of 
 them excellent implements. 

The Iron plows of INIessrs. Hall & Spcer of Pitts- 
 burg, as well as that of R. Hall's referred to by our 
 correspondent, performed well at the State Fair, and 
 attracted much attention. Garrard's plow, of Alle- 
 gheny county, also did excellent work. 

We might enumerate many others, but think F. 
 A. M. will be able to suit himself from among t .ose 
 mentioned. We hope the inquiry will induce some 
 of our correspondents to furnish us with information 
 relative to the respective merits of the plows above 
 named, as well as of others, with which we are not 
 acquainted. ■ 

For the Farm Journal. 
 North Western Pennsylvania. 

]Mr. Editor : — As inquiries have lately appeared 
 in the Farm Journal, asking information in regard to 
 the condition of Agriculture, price of lands, &c., in 
 Northern Pennsylvania, I deem it of importance to 
 communicate what facts, particular observation and 
 authentic accounts have put me in possesssion of, to 
 any who may contemplate settling among us. Ag- 
 riculture either as a science or art, scarcely ranks 
 here as high as the platform of mediocrity — routine 
 farming is the evil with us — and as our fathers did, 
 so do we — manuring is the same as with our ancestors 
 — ploughing is the same — and as an inevitable con- 
 sequence, the crops are the same. But this cannot 
 long exist, for wc have an excellent soil, great natu- 
 ral advantages — and even now a few beams from the 
 light of science have penetrated the dark places — and 
 made the once unproductive wastes blossom as the 
 rose. Our people are awakeningto their interests; have 
 partly dropped their prejudices against " book farm- 
 ing" — and a few leading men in our county, although 
 alone, will e\entually work a complete reformation. 
 An Agricultural Society has lately been organized,] 
 which, if rightly conducted, must be productive ofl 
 much good. 

The population according to the late census iSj 
 nearly 40,000, composed of emigrants from other secH 
 tions of the State, Germans, Irish, Yankees, and 
 French. Education has a very prominent position- 
 there are five academies, one college and several high! 
 schools within the county. We have five paperSij 
 three political, one neutral, and one whose charactei 
 I do not know. The face of the country is undulating, 
 but not hilly. It is watered abundantly, and several 
 beautiful streams pass through it, and some have 
 their origin hero. The celebrated Seneca oil is collect- 
 ed from one, (which bears the name of Oil creek,)and 
 is made an article of considerable traffic. Nature de- 
 signed this section of the "Keystone State," for graz- 
 ing, but very good grain of all kinds can be raised
