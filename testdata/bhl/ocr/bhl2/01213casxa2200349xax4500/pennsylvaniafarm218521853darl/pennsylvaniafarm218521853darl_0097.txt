■with an ordinary amount of labor, I could not esti- 
 mate the average crop of wheat at the present, but I 
 do know, that a Chester county farmer came here two 
 years ago, and bought a farm near a thriving village 
 at $13 dollars per acre, and on which the previous 
 owner could scarcely exceed a fifteen bushel crop. — 
 After one application of manure and leeched ashes, ho 
 raised more than thirty-Jive bushels of good wheat to 
 each acre of ground. Oats and corn do very well with 
 us, and find constant demand and a cash market, — 
 Great quantities of cattle are driven away from this 
 by Eastern drovers to stock farms, and also for the 
 New York market. Wool is not of as fine a quality 
 with us as it is in various other parts of the State, but 
 we find ready sale for all we grow, and receive a fair 
 price — from 33 to 40 cts. was the range last year. — 
 Timberisabundantandof an excellent quality. Pine 
 in the eastern portion of the county, and oak, poplar, 
 walnut, cherry, white ash, &c,, &c. in the other parts 
 grow to a very large size, and add materially to our 
 physical advantages. The Erie Extension Canal 
 passes north and south through the western part, 
 giving us direct communication with Pittsburg and 
 Erie, and bringing us within thirty-six hours ride 
 of New York city. The Pittsburg and Erie R. Road 
 is being located at the present time, which will pass 
 in the vicinity of the canal, and give us additional 
 advantages. I have not mentioned what attention 
 fruit culture is commanding here, but we will assure 
 any who design coming here, that we have good fruit, 
 with the exception of peaches, and these will not en- 
 dure weather as cold as is usually found between 
 41° and 42°. The curculio of late years has done con- 
 siderable damage, but if swine are confined near to 
 the roots of the tree, it usually puts the little fellow 
 at his wits end. The pear blight is an unusual oc- 
 currence. 

If any design removing from the thickly settled 
 - sections of Pennsylvania to the " far west," let them 
 before going so far, examine the merits which north 
 and north-western Pennsylvania so largely i resent 
 and compare the relative price of lands of this, with 
 monotonous prairies — the moral and physical advan- 
 tages we have over a great deal of the Western coun- 
 try, and if the solid and calm conclusion is not in 
 our favor, then we submit to superior judgment.

 I^unar Influence. 

Mr. Editor : — I observe in your publication a 
 discussion on the influence, real or supposed, of the 
 tnoon on the condition of timber and the growth of 
 plants. Mr. Taggart treats the subject very summa- 
 rily, and is endorsed by an anonymous correspondent 
 •who calls himself Franklin. Mrs. Pearson ventures 

on a modest and moderate defence of the power popu- 
 larly imputed to the moon. 

If the lady is wrong she has with her, among oth- 
 ers, a philosopher of reputation, at least equal to the 
 anti-lunarians — nay, the father of physical philoso- 
 phy — Lord Bacon himself. In his Sylva Sylcanim, 
 (century IX) he remarks : — 

" The influences of the moon most observed are 
 four. * * For the increase of moisture the opin- 
 ion received is that seeds will grow soonest ; and hair 
 and nails and hedges and shrubs cut &c., will grow 
 soonest, if they be set or cut in the increase of the 
 moon. * * Take some seeds or roots, as onions, 
 &c., and set them immediately after the change, and 
 others of the same kind, immediately after the full; 
 let them be as like as can be, the earth also the same 
 as near as may be, and therefore best in pots. Let 
 the pots also stand where no rain or sun may come 
 to them, lest the difl"erence of the weather confound 
 the experiment ; and then see in what time the seeds 
 set in the increase of the moon come to a certain 
 height, and how they difier from those that are set 
 in the decrease of the moon. * * There may be 
 other secret effects of the influence of the moon 
 which are not yet brought into observation." — And 
 the author then proceeds to name several of those 
 among which are some with which most farmers be- 
 lieve themselves to be familiar. 

The inductive philosophy taught by Bacon, which 
 looks to facts and discards theory — which is based 
 on observation, and, springing from ascertained 
 truth, must lead to just conclusions, is the only phi- 
 losophy for the farmer whose pursuits ar3 emphati- 
 ically practical. 

The question in hand cannot be settled by an ar- 
 gument — it can only be determined by a long series 
 of observations, made with the precision recommend- 
 ed by Bacon. Although these may never yet have 
 been so conducted as to be conclusive, it will not be 
 denied that the general and almost universal opin- 
 ions of men, in all ages and countries, have been in 
 favor of these alleged lunar influences. Dr. Lard- 
 ner, who is a skeptic on this subject, admits that the 
 extent of the belief, in quarters of the earth distant 
 and disconnected, is such that it is a fit subject for 
 serious investigation. Arago has not thought it be- 
 neath his great reputation to enter on its elaborate 
 examination. The Royal Society of England has 
 done the same. In France the cutting of timber dur- 
 ing the increase of the moon is prevented by law. — 
 De St. Ilaliare found that in Brazil this opinion pre- 
 vailed. Francisco Pinto of Espirito Santo assured 
 him, as the result of his experience, that the wood 
 which was not felled at the full of the moon was im- 
 mediately attacked by the worms and very soon rot- 
 ted. In the extensive forests of Germany the same 
 opinion is entertained and acted upon with the most 
 undoubting confidence of its truth. Saner, a super
