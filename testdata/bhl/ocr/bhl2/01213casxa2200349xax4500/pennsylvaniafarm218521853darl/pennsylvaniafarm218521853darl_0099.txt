•with clay, especially if the soil be gravelly or sandy. 
 Having secured the fluid portions of the heap, it re- 
 mains to prevent exhalations, vehich carry off the 
 most fertilizing ingredients in the form of gases and 
 vapour. These often manifest themselves, when es- 
 caping, to the sense of sight or smell. They should 
 circulate through the heap, but not be allowed to 
 transpire. It is of the utmost consequence to pre- 
 vent their escape. They assist in the process of de- 
 composition, improving the quality of the manure in 
 proportion to their quantity. If the materials be ex- 
 posed to the sun and weather, it will be impossible to 
 confine these volatile parts to the heap ; the heat of 
 the sun and the wind will co-operate in evolving and 
 dispersing them, and the waste thus occasioned, will 
 leave the remainder, comparatively worthless. It 
 will readily suggest itself to all who consider the 
 subject, that the manure heap ought to be under cov- 
 er, to protect it from the direct action of the sun's 
 rays, from rains, and from winds. Stone walls and a 
 roof, for this purpose, would be good economy. 

Some such shelter being provided, to secure the 
 compost or manure still better, and to complete the 
 arrangement, it would be advisable to cover it with 
 a substance that will prevent the gas and vapour 
 from transpiring or passing out of the heap. — 
 Sod or soil would in some measure effect the pur- 
 pose, but not fully. What is infinitely better, is a 
 v«ry small quantity of Plaster of Paris, (less than a 
 peck will answer,) cast over it twice a week. This 
 will combine with the ammonia as it rises from the 
 ■ decomposition of the manure, and completely fix it, 
 at the same time, increasing the value of the fertiliz- 
 ing ingredients of the heap. The effect will be de- 
 monstrated to the senses, by the absence of all dis- 
 agreeable odcrs ; which is the immediate result of 
 the application. 

If the manure is intended for a sandy soil, cop- 
 peras is said to be preferable ; a few pounds pulver- 
 ized, being weekly scattered over it. 

The plan here recommended involves some trouble 
 and expense, but this will be richly compensated by 
 the important advantages that will flow from the 
 sound condition of the stock, the health of which 
 will be preserved, and the quantity and quality of 
 the manure, the farmer will amass for the ameliora- 
 tions of his land and the increase of his crops.

 longevity and Pugnacity of Game Fowls. 
 Mr. Editor : — One of my neighbors, a man of ex- 
 cellent character, informed me a few days since, that 
 be had been the owner of some fowls which he rais- 
 ed from eggs produced by hens imported from Ire- 
 land. They were of the game breed, and two of the 
 ■hens lived to be eighteen years old. Both laid eggs 
 "during the last year sof their life, and one of them 

was hatching, when, overcome by old age, her powers 
 gave way, and she was found dead on the nest after 
 a week's sitting. In consequence of their intolera- 
 ble fighting propensities, he was compelled to cross 
 the breed. The young cocks killed each other by 
 their almost incessant combats, and the hens too, 
 not unfrcquently fought fiercely. He further stated 
 that it was not uncommon, in the ft\ll, when the 
 ground was wet during the day and frozen at night, 
 to find two of the cocks frozen fast in the mud in the 
 morning, where they had fought until so completely 
 exhausted as to be unable to get away. The stock 
 from which these pugnacious fowls were obtained, 
 was brought from Ireland by some Emigrants who 
 located for a while at the village of May Town in 
 Lancaster county.

 Random Recollections and Remarks on Fruit Cul- 
 Culture in Lancaster County, 

Or a Comparison of Fruit Culture FoHy Tears since, 
 ivitk the 2)reseiit time. 

You will perceive, Mr. Editor, by the above head- 
 ing, that the following remarks on Fruit Culture, will 
 necessarily be of a rambling and disconnected order. 
 As I have no neiv theory to advocate or advance, I de- 
 sign taking a retrospective glance of the actual con- 
 dition of things, as I have found them during a series 
 of 3"ears; extending back nearly half a century, and 
 drawing a comparison between the state of fruit cul- 
 ture then and now. 

The demand for choice fruits — or I might say fruit 
 of any kind — is far greater at the present, than at any 
 time previous. The enquiry is often put to me, (as 
 well as to others I presume,) "why do our farmers 
 not raise more fruit? Serious charges are frequently 
 made verbally and through the press, against farmers 
 on this subject, charging them with carelessness, neg- 
 lect, ignorance, &c. Now the object of this article is, 
 in a measure, to disabuse the public mind, and to 
 show, that other causes operate to produce this state 
 of things in regard to fruit culture. 

I must however, congratulate the public, and ex- 
 press a hope, that ere long from the "brightening 
 prospects" and through the increased attention being 
 paid to fruit trees, that fruit will again become 
 plentiful as of yore. 

Thirt}' or forty years since, there were compara- 
 tively, few oV)stacles to the cultivation of various kinds 
 of fruit — no particular mode of planting or cultiva- 
 ting — no specific manures, mineral, animal, vegeta- 
 ble, organic or in-organic — no science was requisite 
 in training or culture to produce meagre crops of 
 imperfect fruit. All that was necessary, was, to plant 
 the trees and protect them from cattle for a few years, 
 and the planter was abundantly rewarded for his la- 
 bour.
