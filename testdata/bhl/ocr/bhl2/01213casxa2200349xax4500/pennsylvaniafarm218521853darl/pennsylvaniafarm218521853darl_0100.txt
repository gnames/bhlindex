ca.e, the produce was good, bad, and indifferent; and 
 if the trees were grafted, the produce was according 
 to the variety propagated. Yet in all instances, the 
 the trees bore abundantly and regularly,— apples bi- 
 ennially, pears, peaches, cherries, &c., almost every 
 year, Occasionally indeed, a late frost Avould "nip 
 the flowers in the bud," but such was not often the 
 result. Forty, thirty, even twenty years since, the 
 apple crop was as certain every alternate year, as the 
 grass growing beneath the trees. Such a thing as a 
 failure, during the apple year was almost unknown. 
 Hundreds and thousands of wagon loads were taken 
 to the distilleries, and converted into apple liquor. — 
 It was a general custom among farmers in those days 
 to prepare for the apple year, by not commencing 
 any extra work, such as making improvements on the 
 farm — or doing any work that could be put off to the 
 intermediate year — or getting through with their cus- 
 tomary work in time to attend to "picking apples" 
 for cider, for whiskey and for winter use. Generally 
 from three to six weeks were thus devoted to the ap- 
 ple crop every second year. 

At the present time — or I might say since the cold 
 winter of 1835 — fruit raising has become a precarious 
 business in this county. On Jan. 5th, 1835, the ther- 
 mometer descended to 22° below zero, and the conse- 
 quence was, that thousands of peach, pear, cherry, 
 and many apple trees perished from the effects of the 
 cold. Whole orchards on level gronnd were frozen 
 so severely as to arrest their growth for years — the 
 trees barely putting out leaves annually, without ex- 
 tension of branches, and the wood black and diseased 
 at the heart. Nevertheless, that cold winter can not 
 be the sole cause of present unfruitfulness — as trees 
 planted since — although more thrifty, are no better 
 bearers than the others. 

In respect to the Pear, we had at that time proba- 
 bly not much over a dozen varieties in the county; 
 these would however, bear profusely nearly every 
 year. The Early Harvest, ripe last of July — St. Ghis- 
 lin, ripe last of Sept. — and a fine luscious winter pear 
 keeping till Feb. and March. These three varieties 
 were apparently as hardy as the oak, and growing 
 nearly as large. Then we had the Butter Pear, and 
 a seedling from it superior to its parent, both ripen- 
 ing in August; we had the Red cheek, the Bergaraot, 
 and few others with local names, and various others 
 without names; all these producing fruit, in quality 
 equal,if not superior to many of the new importations, 
 and the trees growing freely in almost any soil and 
 bearing large crops. Where are those large and 
 healthy trees now? Few of them are in existence, 
 and those still living produce, if any, nothing but in- 
 sipid and worthless fruit. 

Peaches in those days, we might say with truth, 
 were "(lentiful as black berries," and almost as har- 
 dy and productive. Many a wagon load of fine, large 
 peaches have I helped to pick for Peach Brandy. — 

Budding was not practised. All the trees were propa- 
 gated from the stone or seed. It is not believed how- 
 ever, that native stocks are more hardy than those 
 that are budded. Neither worms nor yellows in- 
 jured the trees. I think if my memory serves me, it 
 was between 1812 and 1820 that peach worms and 
 yellows commenced to destroy the trees. At first 
 the cause of so many trees becoming sickly and dy- 
 ing was unknown, no remedy ascertained, and the 
 consequence was, that nearly all the peach trees in 
 the county were destroyed, and for years it was a 
 rarity to see a peach. Subsequently, the cause was 
 ascertained — young trees were planted, and the rem- 
 edy applied ; so that occasionally, we have a crop of 
 Peaches. 

I remember also, a large number of varieties of 
 the Foreign grape vine — the small yellow Gudatel, 
 one of the most tender varieties, producing large 
 crops of luscious fruit in a garden in the open coun- 
 try — and the same kind growing up the gable end of , 
 a house to the roof. These vines produced strong 
 healthy shoots — and the fruit could not have been 
 surpassed in its native country. This was about the 
 year 1820. Every person who took any i nterest in 
 grape culture, in the city of Lancaster at that time,, 
 must remember a species of the Chassalas, or sweet- 
 water, (I am not certain which,) growing in the yard 
 of the late Adam Reigart, and producing splendid 
 clusters of large luscious white or yellow grapes ? — 
 Where are those fine plants now? Or, is there a sin- 
 gle healthy and prolific vine of a foreign species, now 
 growing in the open air without protection, in the 
 city or county of Lancaster ? I know of none 
 in the country. From 1825 to 1828 the mildew 
 commenced its ravages on the Foreign grape, 
 and, although the roots made annual attempts 
 to throw up healthy shoots, the efforts were abortive; 
 and finally branches and roots became exhausted — • 
 and ceased to exist. Every attempt to cultivate the 
 foreign grape in the open country within my know- 
 ledge, since then, has proved a failure. What can 
 be the cause of this state of things, I am unable to 
 say. I have no doubt many who have devoted their I 
 attention to fruit culture, will recollect these changes,] 
 and bear me out in these assertions. 

The same remarks almost literally apply to the Po-| 
 tato, an esculent, not coming under the head of fruit, 1 
 yet of probably greater usefulness. Volumes have 
 been written on the cause, and remedies proposed 
 for the rot, vet all will admit that nothing definite 
 has been discovered up to the present time, that will 
 enable the cultivator to raise sound, healthy potatoes 
 and good, certain crops, as formerly. 

There must always be some cause to produce an 
 effect, and that cause remains to be discovered. The 
 most reasonable conclusion in the premises is, that it 
 to a peculiar state of the atmosphere, and
