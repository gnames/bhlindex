beyond the control of man. Changes in the seasons 
 may sooner or latter correct all these evils. 

At all events, I am not satisfied with any of the 
 proposed theories, or remedies, either specific ma- 
 nures, high culture, or the more common and rather 
 ' hackneyed assertion that all this scarcity of fruit is 
 ovring to the neglect of fanners. You Mr. Ed., as 
 well as all your readers know, that farmers are not 
 very likely to neglect any thing that will sell for rea- 
 dy cash — that would so well renumerate them for 
 j their land and labour as the raising of choice fruit, 
 ! if they could succeed in raising it as well as for- 

merly.

 Is Oats Straw Injurious to Milch Cows ? 

That Oats Straw is unsuitable food for Milch Cows 
 may be well known by many farmers and dairymen ; 
 but the probability that there are some unacquainted 
 with the fact, induces me to write what I have observ 
 ed in reference to it. 

At different times, our cows have failed in their- 
 milk, without any apparent cause ; the cream after 
 being chui-ned a greater length of time than usual, 
 -■ was converted into butter of an inferior quality. 
 This has occasionally happened when the cows were 
 nearly dry, and the defect was attributed to this cause. 

In the early part of the present season, having a 
 large quantity of oats straw, it was liberally used for 
 littering the stables, and yard about the barn. The 
 cows ate it in preference to other food, and the result 
 was similar to what has just been described. The 
 cows in this instance were all fresh. They were im- 
 mediately placed where they could have no access 
 • to the oats straw, when they gradually returned to 
 their former condition. 

If some of the numerous writers for the Journal, 
 will explain why oats straw produces this effect, they 
 will oblige

Northumberland County Agricultural Societ5'. 

The Northumberland County Agricultural Society 
 met at the Court House in Sunbury, on Monday, 
 t 5th, 1852, at 2 o'clock, P. M., for the purpose of elct- 
 ing officers for the coming year. 

The meeting was called to order by David Taggart, 
 on whose motion, J. R. Priestly took the Chair, m the 
 absence of the President. 

In pursuance of the object of the meeting, the 
 Chair appointed a Committee of seven to report offi- 
 cers, to wit: David Taggart, James Pollock, Samuel 
 ' John, Wilson Hutchinson, Robert M. Frick, Daniel 
 Hilbish and Benjamin Gearhart. 

After a short retirement, the Committee came in 
 and reported the following named officers : 

Prest(?en^— Samuel Hunter. 

Vice Presidents — James Cameron, Jos. R. Priestly, 
 Geo. C. Welker, Jacob Scesholts, Wm. B. Kapp, Jac. 
 Hilbish, John Montgomery. 

Corresponding Secretary — David Taggart. 

Recording Secretary — Wm. J. Greenough. 

Treasurer — Wm. L. Dewart. 

Librarian — William M'Carty. 

Managers — Alexander Jordan, Jas. Pollock, Jesse 
 C. Ilorton, Amos E. Kapp, Samuel Shanon, Samuel 
 John, James Eckman, Peter Oberdorf, Jos. Weitzel, 
 Wm. Fegeley, Wm. Deppen, Benneville Holshoe, 
 Michael Lenker, Isaac Baker, John Iline, John B. 
 Heller, Henry J. Reader, Chs. Riddle. 

The repo t was unanimously adopted. 

Jno. F. Wolfinger offered the following resolution, 
 which was adopted nem con.< 

Resolved, That this Society recommend to all farm 
 and lot owners within the county to whitewash all 
 their buildings and fences put up in the rough or 
 with upland boards, for these reasons : First, because 
 whitewash is neat and cleanly. Second, because it 
 operates as an excellent preservative of wood against 
 decay. Third, because it also acts as a preventative 
 of fire. Fourth, because the free use of lime around 
 our premises, has a constant tendency to purify and 
 render wholesome, the air — and lastly, because if 
 generally practised, it would give our towns and 
 country seats a pleasant and beautiful apperance. 

Mr. Taggart asked leave to say a few words in be- 
 half of the paper which he held in his hand. (The 
 Penna. Farm Journal) He spoke of its very low 
 price, and said it Avas the only Agricultural paper in 
 the English language, published in the State, and as 
 such was entitled to our consideration and patronage. 
 This was the 13th number he received, and he was 
 not afraid to assert that every number was worth the 
 full amount of its yearly subscription. He appealed 
 to gentlemen who iiad received it, if it was not so. — 
 The State of New York was able to support 4 or 5 
 such journals, and some of them with subscription 
 lists of 30 and 40,000. It was hard, indeed, if Penn- 
 sylvania could not sustain one, and sustain it hand- 
 somely. The Press had always been considered by 
 him, as the Right Arm of every Art and Science, 
 which it had been established to advocate ; and was 
 not the less so, in the Art and Science of Agiculture. 
 He moved the following resolution which was unani- 
 mously adopted. 

Resolved, That this Society highly approve of the 
 Penna. Farm .Journal, and earnestly recommend it to 
 the patronage of Agriculturists and others through- 
 out the county — and that the members be requested 
 to exert themselves to increase its circulation. 

On motion of ^Ir. Greenough, the township Com- 
 mittees of the last year were re-appointed. 

The proceedings were ordered to be published in 
 the County Newspapers, and in the Farm Journal. 

The meeting then adjourned, after which the Ex- 
 ecutive Committee held a Session to fix a time and 
 place for the next county Eexhibition. 

jPresent : Messrs. Priestly, Cameron, Horton, Pol- 
 lock, John, Jordan, Scesholts, Kipp, Kapp, Taggart, 
 Greenough and Welker. 

Mr. Horton was called to preside. After Consid- 
 erable discussion between Messrs. Cameron, Taggart, 
 Pollock and John, it was resolved to hold the next 
 Fair at Northumberland, on the 7th and 8th of 
 October.

jj^^lt is estimated on good and sufficient data, tha t 
 the gross aggregate of the public lands belonging to
