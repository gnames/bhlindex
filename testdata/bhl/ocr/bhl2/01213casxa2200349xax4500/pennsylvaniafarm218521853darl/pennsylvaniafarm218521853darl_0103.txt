The South Down. 
 We give this month spirited portraits of a South- 
 down Ram and Ewe. This fine breed of sheep is 
 valuable, less on account of the quantity and quality 
 of the fleece than for the mutton. In this particular 
 it is esteemed more highly than any other in the 
 English markets, and would doubtless be so in the 
 United States, if raised in sufficient numbers. At 
 present, we believe, comparatively few breeders give 
 attention to the South- downs, although the few in 

our State who have bred them, speak in the highest 
 terms of their good qualities. M. Ellman, of Glynde, 
 in Sussex, to whom is mainly due the credit of hav- 
 ing, by his judicious breeding, brought the South- 
 down to their present high degree of perfection, and 
 from whose stock the Ram and Ewe, whose portraits 
 we give, are descended, thus describes them : 

" The head small and hornless ; the face speckled 
 or gray and neither too long nor too short ; the lips 
 thin, and the space between the nose and eyes nar-

row ; the under jaw or chap fine and thin ; the ears 
 tolerably wide and covered with wool, and the fore- 
 head also, and the whole space between the ears well 
 protected by it, as a defence against the fly. 

" The eye full and bright, but not prominent. The 
 orbits of the eye, the eye-cap or bone not too project- 

ing, that it may not form a fatal obstacle in lambing. 
 " The neck of a medium length, thin toward the 
 head, but enlarging toward the shoulders, where it 
 should be broad and high and straight in its whole 
 course above and below. The breast should be wide, 
 deep and projecting forward between the fore-legs.
