indicating a good constitution and a disposition to 
 thrive. Corresponding with this, the shoulders 
 should be on a level with the back, and not too wide 
 above ; they should bow outward from the top to the 
 breast, indicating a springing rib beneath, and leav- 
 ing room for it. 

" The ribs coming out horizontally from the spine, 
 and extending fiir backward, and the last rib project- 
 ing more than others, the back flat from the should 
 ders to the setting on of the tail ; the loin broad and 
 flat; the rump broad and the tail set on high, and 
 nearly on a level with the spine, The hips wide ; 
 the space between them and the last rib on either 
 side as narrow as possible, and the ribs generally 

presenting a circular form like a barrel. 

" The belly as straight as the back. 

" The legs neither too long nor too short ; the fore- 
 legs straight from the breast to the foot ; not bending 
 inward at the knee, and standing far apart both be- 
 fore and behind ; the hock having a direction rather 
 outward, and the twist, or the meeting of the thighs 
 behind, being particularly full, the bones fine, yet 
 having no appearance of weakness, and of a speckled 
 or dark color. 

The belly well defended with wool, and the wool 
 coming down before and behind to the knee and to 
 the hock ; the wool short, close, curled and fine, and 
 free from spiry projecting fibres." 

WHITE AND BLACK SWAN. 

The Swan is, beyond all question, the bird to place 
 as a finishing stroke of art, on the smooth lake which 
 expands before our mansions. It is perfectly need- 
 less, however delightful, to quote Milton and others, 
 lauding the arched neck, the white wings, the oary 
 feet, and so on. Its superb beauty is undeniable and 
 acknowledged; and, to borrow an apt metaphor, we 
 do not wish, in the present volume, to thresh straw 
 that has been twice threshed before, to repeat how 
 lovely the Swan is on the silver lake, "floating double, 
 swan and shadow ;" for we might thus run, scissors 
 in hand, through the whole Corpus Poetarum. Our 
 object, in short, is simply to point out the best mode 
 of managing them and keeping them. 

Any one who lives on the banks of a moderately 
 sized stream, and has a Swan-right on that stream, 
 will probably also have the means of keeping a keep- 
 er, who will save him every trouble. 

If any brook runs into and from the pond where 
 they are to remain, their escape through that channel 
 must be prevented by sheep-netting, hurdles, pales, 
 or other fencing, which should be continued some dis- 
 tance inland, lest they should walk away, if they can- 
 not swim away. This precaution will be found par- 
 ticularly necessary if there is any main stream in the 
 immediate neighborhood. A feeding-trough may be 
 fixed for them in the pond, in the part wnere it is 
 most desirable that they should be accustomed to dis- 
 play themselves. Those who are fastidious about the 
 sight of such an object, or who wish to have it thought 

that the Swans keep so much in view from purely 
 disinterested motives, (from simple affection to their 
 masters, not from the greedy love of corn,) may con- 
 trive to have it hid beneath a bank, or behind a tree 
 or shrub. The trough must be fixed in the pond, on 
 two firm posts, within arm's length of the shore, and 
 raised high enough from the water to prevent Ducks 

from 

stealing 

the food contained therein, having a 

cover which lifts up by hinges, and so forms a lid, to 
 keep ont Rats and Sparrows, and open only in front. 
 Many persons, however, feed their Swans by simply 
 throwing the corn into shallow water. They will 
 skim the surface for the light grains which float, and 
 then submerge their heads in search of that which 
 sunk. Should any Carp (that fresh-water Fox) be 
 occupants of the same lake, it will be found that they 
 soon learn the accustomed hours of feeding, and they 
 will come to take their share along with their feath- 
 ered friends. But it is cruel to locate a pair of Swans 
 for the sake' of their beauty, in a new-made piece of 
 water, whose banks and bottom arc as barren and 
 bare as the inside of a hand-basin. A load or two of 
 water-weeds should have been thrown in, the previous 
 spring, to propagate themselves and afi'ord pasturage. 
 Sometimes, after an old-established sheet has been 
 cleansed at a great expense, it is thought that Swans 
 would now look well there, and they are forthwith 
 turned in, to be starved ; whereas they would thankful- 
 ly have undertaken the cleansing task f )r nothing. 
 Swan-food exists in proportion to the shallowness and
