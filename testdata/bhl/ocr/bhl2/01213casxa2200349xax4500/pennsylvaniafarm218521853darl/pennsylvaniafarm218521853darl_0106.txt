Work for June. 

Every farmer who values healthy fruit trees and 
 good fruit will take the precaution necessary to 
 protect both from the attacks of insects. Caterpil- 
 lars especially.demand attention, as they are the lar- 
 vaoe of butterflies and moths, and unless carefully 
 watched and thoroughly exterminated, each success- 
 ive year demand an increased amount of labor to 
 effect their destruction. So numerous have they be- 
 come in certain sections that scarce a plant escapes 
 them. Go to work then in good earnest, examine 
 every fruit tree on your premises, and wherever you 
 find the slightest trace of them, cease not your efforts 
 until all are destroyed. Do this and next year your 
 labors in the department will be much lighter. 

During the latter part of this and the first of the 
 succeeding month, sow your turnips. By a reference 
 to our last number, page 34, the mode of culture 
 pursued by Mr. Buist, (who, by the way we consider 
 excellent authority) will be found. Do not confine 
 yourselves to tlie quantity required for family use ; 
 as is generally the case ; but sow with a free hand ; 
 cultivate well, and try the value of the Swedes and 
 other varieties as food for your cattle next winter. — 
 The value of the turnip crop is fully appreciated by 
 English farmers. It is said to be the "sheet anchor 
 of light soil cultivation and the basis of the alternate 
 system of English husbandry, to which every class 
 of the community is so much indebted. 

Carrots and Sugar Beets for stock should also be 
 sown. The value of carrots as food for stock, like 
 that of turnips appears not yet to be fully under- 
 stood. Its cultivation in our State with perhaps a 
 few exceptions, has never extended beyond a small 
 bed in the garden. We are glad to see, however, 
 that our northern neighbors are taking hold of the 
 subject in good earnest, and hope soon to find it 
 awakening a proper degree of interest in Pennsylva- 
 nia. The fattening qualities of the carrot, unques- 
 tionably rank first amongst the root crops. The cul- 
 tivation is easy, the cost trifling, the yield per acre 
 immense, and the value unquestioned. 

Corn will need your careful attention. Weed and 
 cultivate well. Weeds like Caterpillars, are the re- 
 sult of negligence. One years inattention to them at 
 the proper season, will only double your labors for 
 the next. Grapple vigorously with them this month. 
 Give them no quarter. Serve them in a like manner 
 for a year or two to come and you will save your- 
 selves much work, and secure better crops. Never 
 permit a weed to run to seed; if you do, you will 
 have a thousand perhaps in its place the next year. 

Haymaking comes in season during this month. — 
 Every good farmer will have made the necessary 
 preparations for this important season. " Make hay 
 while the sun shines" is an old but excellent adage, 
 which applies as well to the preliminaries to hay- 
 making, as hay making itself. The Forks and Rakes 

should all be ready in sufficient quantity and good or- 
 der. The mows should be cleaned out, and the plat- 
 forms for ricks constructed ; so that when your hay 
 is ready to be drawn from the field, there may be no 
 necessity for stopping your hands to prepare the place 
 to receive it. See that your wagons, ropes &c., are 
 in trim, and your scythes in good order. The follow- 
 ing excellent remarks, we copy from the American 
 Agriculturist. 

"Many farmers do not consider the scorching effects 
 of our June and July sun, and the consequence is, 
 that hay is too much dried in this country. Unless 
 the grass be very thick and heavy, it will generally 
 cure sufficiently, when exposed in the swarth for two 
 days. AVhen shook or stirred out, it should not remain 
 in this condition beyond the first day, or it will thus 
 lose much of its nutritive juices ; nor should dew or 
 rain be permitted to fall upon it, unless in cocks. It 
 is better, after partially drying, to expose it for three 
 or four days in this way, and as soon as properly 
 cured, place it under cover. It is a good practice to 
 salt hay when put up, as it is thus secured against 
 damage from occasional greenness ; and there is no 
 waste of the salt, as it serves the double object, after 
 curing the hay, of furnishing salt to the cattle and 
 manure heap. 

"Clover should be cut after having fully blossomed 
 and assumed a brownish hue. By close cutting, more 
 forage is secured, and the clover afterwards springs up 
 more rapidly and evenly. The swarth, unless heavy, 
 ought never be stirred open, but allowed to wilt on 
 the top. It may then be carefully turned over, and 
 when thus partially cured, placed in high slender 
 cocks, and remain till sufficiently dry to remove into 
 the barn. Clover may be housed in a much greener 
 state, by spreading evenly over it in the mow, from 
 ten to twenty quarts of salt. Some add a bushel, 
 but this is more than is either necessary for the clo- 
 ver, or judicious for the stock consuming it ; as the 
 purgative effects of too much salt induce a wasteful 
 consumption of the forage. A mixture of alternate 
 layers of dry straw with the clover, by absorbing its 
 juices, answers the same purpose, while it materially 
 improves the flavor of straw for fodder. 

The scorching heat of June, July and August, de- 
 mand of the farmer more attention to his manures 
 than at any other season of the year. We here take 
 occasion to commend the adoption of Manure Sheds, 
 instead of the old practice of exposing the contents 
 of Stables &c., to the rain and sun. We know of 
 many persons who have adopted the shed system, 
 and who are highly satisfied with the increased value 
 of the manure thus protected. Manure sheds may 
 be so constructed as to answer the double purpose of 
 sheltering both cattle and manures ; and at a com- 
 paratively trifling expense. 

But whether you have sheds or not, the droppings 
 of the cattle in the stables as well as around the barn 
 yard should be thrown to the common heap, and 
 thus, in part, prevent the loss which always arises 
 from the exposure to the hot suns of summer. The 
 weeds pulled or cut, should all be carted to the prin- 
 cipal heap, where they are speedily converted into 
 fertilizing matter, instead of being thrown into
