GREAT IMPROVEMENT in HYDRAULIC RAMS. 

The subscriber, during the past six years of practical experience 
 in putting u|i Hydraulic Rams, has seen the necessity of some im- 
 provement, and would now most respectfully say to the communi- 
 ty at large, that he has completed some very important Improve- 
 ments, which renders the Ram much more durable — (there being 
 no friction or wearing of metals against metal in any part of the 
 machine) also less liable to breakage — (such parts being made of 
 wronglit iron as are liable to break, instead of cast iron as u»ual) 
 the me(hod of regnlating the quantity of water consumed is more 
 convenient, with greatei nicety and no possible danger of getting 
 out of order ; and another nevir feature is the enameling or coating

the inside surface of the Ram with glass, thereby preserving it 
 from rust, making it (with water-proof paint upon the outside) al- 
 mosfimperishable. These Rams are warranted to be more durable 
 than any others made in the United States, without any exceptions. 

Gatchel's Double Acting Rams, have become very valuable in 
 raising spring or we!l water, by means of a creek These Rams 
 with suitable Pipes will be put down, (and warranted for one year) 
 at the lowest possible price for cash. 

Gatchel's Rams will be put up (when preferred) as usual, by the 
 si.'bscriber, who has erected large numbers of them in various parts 
 of the country. 

As to the quantity of water e'evated by the above ram, a chal- 
 lenge for not less than One Hundred Dollars is still open, to any 
 or all of those persons who alledge that their rams will elevate a 
 greater amount or per cent of ^vater. The truth is that a certain 
 per cent of water may be raised by the ram, according to known 
 'aws of mechanics and philosophy, and he who pretends to raise 
 more may be set down as an arrant humbug, and intending to de- 
 ceive the public. 

Farmers and others wanting Rams will subserve their interest 
 by examining the above Rams before purchasing elsewhere (one 
 may be seen in practical operation at the store at any time.) 

Pipes of all kinds furnished, and contracts for plumbing at the 
 lowest rates for Cash. A large variety of pumps, with pipes to suit, 
 always on hand. 

The subsr-riber would also eall the attention of the public to an 
 article of Lightning Rod, constructed upon the principles laid 
 down by Professor Hare, Farady, Dr. Franklin. Lardner, Arago, 
 W. Snow Harris, F. R, S , and other philosophers, who have writ- 
 ten on this subject. 

They are cheap, effective and highly approved of by all who see 
 them. Call and examine for yourselves. A. C. BROWN,
