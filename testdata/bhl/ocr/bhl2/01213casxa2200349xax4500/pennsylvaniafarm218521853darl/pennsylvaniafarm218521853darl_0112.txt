bubble on the ocean's breast. How this Herculean 
 task is to be accomplished, we shall reserve for an- 
 other article, merely remarking in conclusion, that 
 to the agricultural press mainly, must we look for 
 the consummation of this great object. 

American Pomological Congress. 

In our last, we published the circular of Dr. W. 
 D. Brinckl§, of Philadelphia, announcing that the 
 third session of the Congress of Fruit Growers would 
 be held in Philadelphia, on the 13th of September 
 next. There can be little reason to doubt that this 
 will be not only the largest, but the most interesting 
 session the Congress has yet had. A more suitable 
 place than Philadelphia could not have been selected, 
 although it is to be regretted that an earlier day had 
 not been fixed upon for the meeting. By the 13th 
 of September, the season for many of our finest 
 peaches will be past, and as the peach flourishes in 
 all its glory in the country surrounding Philadelphia 
 for many miles, a fair exhibition of all the fine varie- 
 ties of which the district can boast, would be very 
 desirable. However, as this is not possible, we must 
 do the best we can. 

We most earnestly commend this meeting to the 
 attention of fruit growers generally, whether horti- 
 culturists by profession, or mere amateurs. The 
 display of fruits will be remarkably fine. The varied 
 products of every section of our widely extended 
 country, with all its diversity of soil and climate will 
 be exhibited, and the results of particular methods 
 of culture shown. As such, the exhibition will prove 
 a school of instruction to all who may attend. The 
 convention will be composed of the most successful 
 and distinguished fruit growers in the United States 
 — veterans in horticulture, whose opinions upon the 
 merits of the various fruits submitted to their judg- 
 ment, the method of culture, &c., will be ripe with 
 interest and instruction. 

But while we call upon fruit growers generally, to 
 encourage this laudable enterprise, we especially call 
 upon our Pennsylvania horticulturists to show their 
 kands in the convention. We have strong faith in 
 the ability of the " Keystone State" to compete suc- 
 cessfully with any of her sisters, and we trust for 
 the sake of her own reputation she will do it. It 
 will afford us pleasure to furnish every information 
 of which we are possessed, to those who may desire 
 it, or forward, at the proper time, any specimens of 
 fruit that may be sent to us. 

Seedling Fruits-- A Request. 

When, last fall, we asserted that the southern por- 
 tion of Pennsylvania, was not only one of the best 
 fruit growing sections in the United States, but the 
 very best for peaches, pears, cherries, apples anl 
 plums, our assertion was regarded as rather a bold 
 one. It would not have been made had wo not been 

firmly convinced of its truthfulness. In order, how- 
 ever, that we may not appear in the light of an emp- 
 ty boaster, we earnestly call upon those who have 
 the evidence in their possession for a confirmation 
 of what we then asserted. We know that in Lancaster 
 county, but especially in the city of Lancaster and 
 its immediate vicinity, there are a great many very 
 fine seedling fruits of difierent kinds. Most of these 
 seedlings, although of superior merit, are not known 
 beyond the limits of the immediate neighborhood in 
 which they originated. A (few, among which is the 
 Gen. Hand plum,) have been heard of abroad ; but 
 the number is small. Than the Hosen Schenck pear 
 there is none earlier or finer. The Copper plum is a 
 superb fruit. Seedling peaches of monster size, and 
 delicious flavor, abound in every direction. We have 
 on our premises several seedling peaches, which 
 we have no hesitancy in asserting to be vastly supe- 
 rior in all that constitutes good fruit, to hundreds of 
 others to which high sounding titles have been given 
 and from which the originators realize immense pro- 
 fits in the sale of trees. Cherries, too, of the most 
 superb varieties, (and many of them seedlings), are 
 to be found in abundance. 

A few days since we had the pleasure of tasting 
 some seedling strawberries, raised by a gentleman in 
 the vicinity of Lancaster, which, in point of size and 
 flavor, wei'e remarkably fine. We consider them de- 
 cidedly superior to Hovey's Seedling, being more 
 prolific, although perhaps not quite so large. 

Now the history of these fruits deserves to be writ- 
 ten, and it is our intention to prepare a short account 
 of each specimen that may come under our notice, 
 and in furtherance of our intention, we respectfully 
 ask that those who have fine seedling fruit of any 
 kind, will favor us with a sample, and the history of 
 it. By this means we shall be enabled to arrive at 
 correct conclusions both in regard to the quality and 
 origin of the fruits. A committee has been appoint' 
 ed by the Lancaster County Agricultural Society, for 
 the purpose of investigating this subject. They hold 
 their meetings monthly, and the friends of horticul- 
 ture are respectfully and earnestly requested to aid 
 them in their labors, by sending in contributions of 
 fine fruits, &c.

Much has been said and written for and against 
 the different varieties of improved fowls now claim- 
 ing so large a share of public attention. The extra- 
 vagant prices asked, and frequently paid for superi- 
 or specimens of the various breeds, have led many 
 persons to regard the attempt to introduce them to 
 our farmers generally, as a matter of speculation, and 
 that it will have a termination similar to the moras 
 multicavlis mania of bygone days. We do not think 
 80. The little experience wc have had in breeding 
 the now varieties, induces us to believe that the soon-
