er the common dung hill fowls are dispensed 
 vrith, and their places supplied by some of the larg- 
 er breeds, the sooner will our farmers begin to realize 
 profit trom their chickens. Although five or ten dol- 
 lars may at first appear an extravagant price for a 
 pair of chickens, it is really not so, when the ad- 
 vantages that will follow their purchase are taken 
 into consideration. No person who has ever seen 
 fair specimens of Shanghae or Cochin China fowls, 
 •will for a moment dispute their superiority to the 
 dung hill fowl in point of size. Here then is one 
 important point in their favor. Large fowls, if young, 
 will certainly, always command a better price in 
 market than smaller ones. But they possess other 
 advantages. Well cared for Shanghae's, attain a 
 larscer size at five months than the common fowls 
 at twelve. We have now in our flock a pair of Cochin 
 Chinas, three months old, which weigh Si pounds, 
 the cock 5 ajid the pullet 3^ pounds. But it is con- 
 tended by those who stand opposed tG " big chick- 
 ens," that the greater amount of food they consume 
 than the smaller ones, more than overbalances the 
 advantages of their increased size. This too, how- 
 ever, we conceive to be a mistake. We have a few 
 common fowls, which are kept principally for hatch- 
 ing — their small size giving them for that purpose, a 
 decided advantage over the heavier Shanghae. Care- 
 ful observation has fully satisfied us that they con- 
 sume as much food as the larger ones. The common 
 fowl is a much more ravenous feeder than the Shang- 
 I ha9. If favorite food is given them, nothing short of 
 repletion will satisfy them. Not so with the Shang- 
 ; has or Cochin China. They feed as they move — slow- 
 , ly, and appear to turn every grain of corn or wheat 
 to advantage. 

Much has been said in regard to the superior 
 egg-producing qualities of the Shanghoe and Cochin 
 Chinas. To a limited extent we have tested this 
 point also, and so far as our experience goes, unhes- 
 itatingly yield to them the palm. 

Our common fowls are as good specimens as any 
 we have ever seen. We paid a high price for them, 
 for the special purpose of testing their egg-producing 
 qualities, as compared with our finer fowls, and for 
 hatching as before stated. The result has been, that 
 ! with the same food — same lodging, and same atten- 
 tion in every particular, the Shanghaes have beaten 
 them two to one. 

Another point in favor of the Shangha3 is, that 
 they arc far more sociable, not nearly so much in- 
 clined to be mischievous and even if thus inclined, 
 far leas capable of doing damage; as the remarkable 
 ehortness of their wings, and the great size of their 
 bodies prevents them from flying over fences, into the 
 garden or fields, or injuring the grain in the stacks 
 or mows. For these and other reasons, we feel in- 
 clined to give the improved breeds the preference 
 over the common ones, and wc believe it would be 

economy on the part of our farmers generally, to in- 
 troduce them even at a cost of ten dollars for the 
 first pair. But while recommending their introduc- 
 tion, we would at the same time caution purchasers 
 against the impositions practiced on the unwary, by 
 unprincipled dealers. On several occasions during 
 the past few months we have seen fowls purchased 
 in Philadelphia at high prices, and represented as 
 Shanghaes or Cochin Chinas, which were perfect li- 
 bels upon the fine breeds they were designed to re- 
 present. If you wish good stock, buy from dealers 
 and breeders only, whose characters are known to be 
 good. We have recommended several dealers whom 
 we believe will act fairly, and from whom we have 
 purchased stock for our own yard. 

Gapes in Chickens. 

For several years our early chickens nearly all die 
 with the gapes, a disease that is very fatal in this 
 neighborhood. Will you or some of your correspon- 
 dents give us through your paper, a preventive and 
 cure for the above disease. It would be worth more 
 than several years subscription to the Journal.

[Several remedies have been given for the gapes. 
 Salt given in their water has been recommended. — 
 Spirits of Turpentine mixed with rice has also been 
 used with success. The generality of breeders agree 
 that the gapes are produced the by fi\scicola, a 
 parasitic worm in the windpipe, which may be re- 
 moved by the introduction into it, of a small feather, 
 without any web except at the farther end. Give the 
 feather a few turns and the fascicola will be either 
 dislodged and coughed up by the chick, or brought 
 up on the end of the feather. We have tried thi.s 
 plan, but never found any worms. Our plan is, (and 
 we have never yet had achicken die with the gapes) to 
 have mother and chicks, comfortably housed at sun- 
 down — keep their drinking water in shallow iron ves- 
 sels, and give them, once a day, a little ground Ca- 
 yenne pepper mixed with corn meal. In the morning 
 they are permitted to run at large as early as their 
 inclination prompts them.] 

I wish to hear from some of your patrona,the be^t 
 plan for winter-feeding cattle for beef. 'I'here are 
 different opinions on the subject. Some say keep 
 them in the stable all the time. Others say turn out 
 about 4 hours in 24 ; others again just feed and turn 
 out. I would just say, in tliis part of the county 
 wc have a sufficiency of shelter for stock in winter 
 to protect thom from storms. J. II. 

Mr. Editor : My neighbor C's barn is very much 
 infested with the weevil ; and having sustained a 
 considerable loss, as he believes, last year, he fears 
 their working in his wheat after the coming harvest. 
 Is there any means of destroying them? If you or 
 any of your correspondents can give us earl}' infor- 
 mation on this snbjcct,wo will remember the Journal 

to our neighbors. Yours itc,
