to their disciples, through many genei-ations; and 
 who arrived at an excellence of wisdom and power 
 truly marvellous ; commenced by long and patient ob- 
 servations of the phenomena of the atmosphere, with 
 all marked mutations in the animal and vegetable 
 kingdom ; as also the workings of the human mind. 
 These they referred to the various stages of the moon, 
 to her place in the heavens, and her conjunction with 
 the planets ; their unmistakeable influence being also 
 taken into the calculation. Finding the same phe- 
 nomena generally occurring under certain aspects, 
 these mighty Astrologers fixed the signs, expressing 
 them by hieroglyphical characters, denoting their in- 
 fluence, and the portion of the human frame particu- 
 larly affected, at certain seasons. Superstition which 
 is always the child of ignorance, has obscured this 
 science with the thick mists of fable, and erroneous 
 observations ; these however no more annihilate the 
 truth of astrology, than clouds which veil the earth, 
 extinguish the sun, by preventing him from shining 
 upon us. 

"Modern science" is like the boy who made seven 
 tops while his father constructed a wagon wheel, and 
 then boasted himself the superior workman. 

I really beg pardon of the truly gentlemanly Edit- 
 or of the Journal for the monopoly of valuable space, 
 but I must yet give Medicus his experiments First 
 we test the influence of the moon in her nodes. If 
 Medicus will lay a board on young growing grass, 
 when the moon is in her descending node, he will find 
 on taking it up after a week or so, that it has smoth- 
 ered the grass under it,and settled close to the earth. 
 A similar board similarly placed, in the time of the 
 moon's ascension, will not do so' He will find on 
 taking it up, after the same interval, that the grass 
 has continued to grow under it, apparently lifting 
 the board with its growth. Next for the phases, he 
 shall select a head of the large double French mari- 
 ' gold, he shall have no seed but what grows in this 
 I head. lie shall plant some near the full of the moon 
 j when the sign is in Gemini or Libra; they will pro- 
 duce large dpuble flowers. He shall plant the same 
 head of seeds near the change of the moon, and the 
 flowers will be single ; and if the sign be at Leo or 
 Scorpio, they will not develope even one full row of 
 petals. 

He shall sow, plant, or transplant herb, vine, or 
 tree when the moon is near the full, and the sign of 
 Virgo, and he will have abundance of blossoms, and 
 of long succession, but great paucity of seed or fruit, 
 lie shall transplant trees, or cut down weeds, briars 
 or thistles, when the moon is old, and in the sign of 
 the Heart, and if they do not die at once, they will 
 never thrive, but dwindle away and perish. 

When Medicus shall have made these experiments, 
 and witnessed their results, year after year, he will 
 become a convert to the theory of Lunar and Stellar 
 influence; and though like hundreds of others he may 

know nothing of the astrological principles by which 
 nature is governed ; he will believe the results which 
 he sees, and cannot controvert. Then I shall expect 

to hoar from him a^ain.

Plowing iu Clover. 

Mr. Editor : In the last number of the " Farm 
 Journal," you ask farmers to write for it, if but a 
 few lines, and as I have never yet had an attack of 
 "ink mania," I thought I would comply with your 
 i-equest. I read Mr. Gowen's address, delivered be- 
 fore "the Lancaster County Agricultural Society," 
 with pleasure and profit to myself; but there is one 
 part of it, which I think he gave hastily and withoutdue 
 reflection, and which I consider erroneous, and liable 
 to mislead young farmers of the interior, wlio have 
 not the means of purchasing, nor the facilities of 
 getting high priced manures. I have reference to 
 that part of the address, where he deprecates "the 
 plowing in of Green Crops as a succedancum for 
 manure," he states too, that eventu all}', if persevered 
 in,itwill impoverish the soil. This I consider a grave 
 error, and I had hoped, that some abler farmer 
 would have in your last issue, dispi-ovcd this whole- 
 sale statement, ; but as no one has done it, I will try 
 and prove that Mr. Gowen is incorrect in this part 
 of his address. I have not the vanity to suppose, 
 that I can teach so eminent and able an agricutlur- 
 ist as Mr. Gowen any thing new, but I do think, if 
 he were to look at facts, and not depend too much on 
 hypothesis, that he would alter his opinion so far as 
 Clover is concerned. Who among the farmers of 
 Lancaster County has not found that by plowing in 
 Clover, that he has enriched his soil ? And has 
 not experience taught them that "the acidulated 
 water of partly gro'mi clover is manure indeed !" â€” 
 AVhat other green substance adds so much fat to our 
 cattle, as this partly grown clover ? no matter how 
 "acidulated" it may be. If it is essentially acid, 
 why do not our domestic animals cat the "sorrel" 
 with as much avidity as the clover ? The fact is, 
 clover is not acid, and chemistry teaches us, that 
 there is as much fertilizing property in it, as in any 
 othervegetable substance with one exception. Another 
 fact is, that it is the cheapest and easiest mode of 
 adding fertility to our lands, and one too that I hope 
 will be persevered in, until something else be discov- 
 ered that will be easier and cheaper.

This is I believe, as correct an analysis as is usual-
