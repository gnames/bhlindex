gen as this ? Ammonia the most powerful of all 
 fertilizers, is composed of Nitrogen 14. 15, Hydro- 
 gen 3. and it is principally these two elementary 
 substances (II. and N.) that gives to the clover its 
 fertilizing properties. Its net work of roots add hu- 
 mus, to the soil, for its principal nourishment is 
 from the sub-soil into which its tap roots have been 
 traced to the depth of thirty-four inches, thus adding 
 organic matter from which the cereals get their food. 
 Dr. Lee says, " Instead of impoverishing the soil, a 
 sound public policy demands that we should increase 
 its natural fruitfulness, to meet the increasing wants 
 ef an ever augmenting population. To achieve this 
 result in the most economical manner, recourse 
 must be had to the agency of growing vegetation. 
 Among the plants best adapted to the improvement 
 of land are the grasses, trifolias, legumes, turnips, 
 and other root crops. In skillful hands, these can be 
 so managed as to produce a great deal of cheap ma- 
 nure to enrich the surface of the earth, while the 
 substance of the manure itself will be mainly drawn 
 from the subsoil and the atmosphere." I have now 
 given the chemical composition ot clover, which gives 
 us really more fertilizing principle, than the excre- 
 ment of cattle fed on the hay in a dry state. Cattle 
 excrement gave by the same Chemist, carbon 42.8, 
 hydrogen 5.2, oxygen 37.7, azote 2.3, salts 12. The 
 dry excereraent of the horse contained hydrogen 5.1, 
 azote 2.2. Thus we see that chemistry teaches us 
 that green clover really contains more fertilizing pro- 
 perties than the excrement of animals fed on it, and 
 it teaches us, too, that clover plowed in will really 
 " pay better" than to make into hay, feed to cattle, 
 and then cart back again to the field ; losing part 
 of its nitrogenous properties by the process. "We 
 can get no manure that will "pay as well" and, is so 
 easy of application, requiring no extra labor; and 
 none that adds more permanency, or contains so 
 much fertilizing properties in so cheap and easy 
 manner, as the clover plowed in. Facts and experi- 
 ence teach us the utility of plowing in green crops 
 to increase the fertility of our lands, and I earnestly 
 hope that the practice will increase and go on increas- 
 ing, until every husbandman in the land, shall make 
 it his duty to plow in green crops in every rotation. 

" Science can do no more for the agriculturalist, 
 than to establish general and correct principles to 
 guide his practice and researches. But the agricul- 
 turist should weigh carefully all the facts and the 
 large experience of thousands, which other cultivators 
 of the soil have recorded for his instruction and bene- 
 fit." These are the principles which should govern 
 every farmer in our land, and it is only careful 
 observation, and a multitude of facts, that should 
 induce him to give the weight and power of his 
 name, in favor of or against any of the common prin- 
 ciples of rotation of crops. B. F. G.

Random Recollections and Remarks on Fruit Cul- 
 Culture in I^aucaster County, 

Or a Comparison of Fruit Culture Forty Years since 
 with the present time. 

[concluded.] 

Touching the subject of neglect or carelessness of 
 farmers not giving their trees the proper cultivation, 
 I have seen so many articles, and heard verbal re- 
 marks on the subject, that it appears to me necessary 
 to try to vindicate my brother farmers from so unjust 
 an aspersion. 

Even you, Mr. Editor, drawing an imaginary sketch 
 of the "Model Farmer," in the Journal for Nov., under 
 the head of "the farmer who had nothing to learn," 
 have been, unwittingly, I trust, led into the popular 
 error ; probably by reading the views of others; and ' 
 as a necessary consequence, have given us farmers 
 some pretty hard " hits," about the " poultry roost- 
 ing on the trees — manure drain emptying into a 
 stream of water — hogs wallowing in a puddle at the 
 kitchen door — his young orchard almost destroyed by 
 the borer," &c. 

All the above " rubs," as quoted from your article, 
 are foreign to my present purpose, except the borer. 
 Fortunately, however, I think you were mistaken in 
 your surmises in regard to the borer. As to this for- 
 midable insect, however its ravages may have almost 
 annihilated trees in some parts of the country to the 
 eastward, it is, as yet, I believe a stranger with us, 
 certainly not doing damage to any serious extent in 
 Lancaster county.* 

As respects high cultivation. I believe it to bo 
 worse than useless, producing a vigorous growth of 
 wood without a corresponding quality or quantity of 
 fruit. The wood by its luxuriant growth becomes 
 tender, less able to withstand the effects of climate, 
 and in the pear particularly, predisposing the trees to 
 be attacked by blight. 

Sjyecijic manures. — A writer in the Horticulturist 
 for October, comparing the Seckel pear as brought to 
 the Philadelphia market at the present time with 
 thoseoffered there formei-ly, and those now produced at 
 Boston, says : " That in the vicinity of Philadelphia 
 the soil has run out ;" or in other words, " owing to 
 the long cultivation of the variety, the proper food 
 for the pear has become exhausted, — and that the su- 
 perior quality of the fruit raised at Boston is owing 
 to superior cultivation, and the application of speci- 
 fic manures." Now, I would respectfully ask, can 
 a few hundred trees in the vicinity of Philadelphia, 
 (say ten or fifteen miles around the city,) have ex- 
 hausted all the elements in the soil through that sec- 
 tion of country ? There are no doubt hundreds of 
 acres in that region that never produced a Seckel 
 nor any other pear tree, and yet, if the elements have 
 all been exhausted by the few trees growing there, 
 the roots of pear trees must have rambled miles and 
 miles through the soil, to have found and appropria-
