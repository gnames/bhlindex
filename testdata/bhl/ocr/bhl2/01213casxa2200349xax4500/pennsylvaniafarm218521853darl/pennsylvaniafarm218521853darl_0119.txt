Its low, wide spreading branches, luxuriant as they 
 are, would make a great addition to pleasure 
 grounds, or Cemeteries. Should any amateurs, 
 whose attention you may call to it — incline to try its 
 merits as an Evergreen Shrub, I will be ready at any 
 time to give all the information in regard to it that 
 I am in possession of. 

Respectfully yours,

Toads and Insects. 

Mr. Editor: — Although not the handsomest of 
 living creatures, the toad is certainly one of the gar- 
 dener's best friends. Quiet and unobtrusive in his 
 manners, perfectly harmless and asking no privilege 
 but that of being permitted to roam ad libitum thro' 
 the garden, he is continually rendering excellent ser- 
 vice. I have ever been the friend of toads, and great- 
 ly regret the cruelty frequently manifested towards 
 them by unthinking persons. My garden abounds 
 with them, and a more sociable set of fellows I have 
 rarely met with. Whenever I commence spading, 
 the newly spaded bed is sure to be surrounded with 
 them, watching quietly but eagerly for any grub or 
 worm thafe may chance to be thrown up. 

Last summer, whilst spading some ground which 
 abounded in the large white grubs usually found in 
 the vicinity of clover stalks, I observed a middling sized 
 toad sitting near, quietly watching my operations. — 
 Presently one of the grubs was turned up, and in 
 order to test his fondness for such food, I threw it 
 before him. In an instant it was swallowed. As he 
 appeared to relish the morsel, I gave him another 
 and another, until finally he made way with seven 
 of them, when he retired. Next day he returned, 
 and despatched six more of the grubs, which I gave 
 him. I mention these little facts merely for the pur- 
 pose of showing how large number of troublesome 
 worms and insects a single toad will destroy. 

As some of your readers may have a cucumber bed, 
 which the striped bug is destroying, permit me to 
 suggest a remedy for these pests, which I have found 
 most efiectual. Between the hills, lay pieces of board 
 sufficiently raised from the ground to enable the toads 
 to conceal themselves under them during the day and 
 my word for it the bugs will speedily disappear. — 
 Whether they are eaten by the toads, or whether their 
 presence is so unpleasant as to drive them awiiy, I 
 cannot say, but presume the toads destroy them.

Ou Thick and Thin Sowing. 

Mk. Editor: — In examining these two important 
 points in agricultural practice, one is very much per- 
 plexed between various opinions. It seems to have 
 been an old habit among our farmers, to sow thick, 
 and they were probably governed in this course by 
 the test and testimony of experience. Since the in- 
 troduction of the drill, one of its recommendations, 
 the most frequently urged, is, that it saves seed. In 
 this way, we are put afloat again, leaving the ques- 
 tion, of which is best, thick or thin seeding, unde- 
 cided, and thrown upon the discretion and experience 
 of each individual farmer. 

An English agriculturist, who seems to farm very 
 brilliantly, sows but one bushel of wheat to the acre. 
 It is drilled in, in rows, twelve and a half inches 
 apart. " And nothing," says the authority, " can 
 exceed the regularity and beauty of the plan." But 
 lest some of our farmers should heedlessly adopt this 
 practice, and attempt to imitate or compete with this 
 fortunate Englishman, they must know how it is that 
 he is thus successful, and knowing this, they may 
 undertake the experiment, if they please. lie begins, 
 with a large outlay of capital, to get his ground in 
 condition to produce. His manures are the richest 
 barnyard manure — and superphosphate of lime, four 
 hundred weight to the acre. These bring him heavy 
 crops of turnips, sheep are fed with these turnips, in 
 the ground, — and besides, to encourage them to come 
 forward rapidly for profit, they are tempted with an 
 unlimited supply of bruised beans, peas and oil cake. 
 As the turnips are consumed — the ground all the 
 time being manured by the sheep — it is plowed and 
 sowed with barley. This is followed by clover and 
 grass seed, a part of which is fed, and a part mown. 
 Then the ground is again plowed, and rolled, and har- 
 rowed, and after all this coaxing, is at last treated to 
 one bushel of wheat to the acre. The result was for- 
 ty-eight bushels of wheat to the acre — as to the 
 amount in money, there is complete silence. 

But if we, on this side, cannot imitate this English 
 farming — is there nothing to learn from all this gen- 
 erous expenditure, skill and labor. There are two 
 elements of success in this system, which not only 
 can be adopted, but muM be adopted, by all who wish 
 to have their farms in fine order, and to make them 
 produce. 

The first is a complete disintegration of the soil, 

which is effected by the repeated plowings and har- 
 rowings mentioned, the other, is warming abundant- 
 ly, with the best manure, and no doubt the plowing 
 was of the very deepest, instead of being scratched 
 over as much of this continent is, by implements that 
 go very little deeper than a hen's claws. 

Another English farmer, who seems to pursue a 
 similar system to the one just noticed, and whose 
 farm is represented as being in the highest state, 
 takes an opposite view, as to the sowing of wheat.
