and always with success against the foe. The result 
 was most gratifying. The tree which had been fu- 
 migated, bore me a fair crop of excellent fruit, while 
 on the other scarcely a single plum came to perfec- 
 tion. 

This spring the two blossomed profusely. I again 
 caused the sulphur to be applied, and at the period 
 of writing, I am rejoicing in the prospect of a fine 
 crop of plums. If you think this little experiment is 
 worth presenting to your readers, it is at your ser- 
 vice ; and is ofifered not with any desire to see my 
 name in print, but with the hope that it may prove 
 effectual in ridding our fruit trees of this troublesome 
 and destructive insect. R. Fisher.

My Two Neighbors. 

Mr. Editor: Twenty years of my life having been 
 devoted to tilling the soil, (although not now engaged 
 in farming) and being moreover of a naturally ob- 
 servant disposition, I sometimes flatter myself that a 
 sight of any farmers's premises is to me sure index 
 of his character. The spirit of the master, is always 
 seen in the appearance of things on the farm over 
 which he presides, and the economical money-making 
 farmer is as readily known by the order in which 
 every department of his premises is kept, as by his 
 ordinary pecuniary transactions. By the term 
 " economical, money-making farmer," I do not 
 mean the narrow-minded penurious man, who has 
 not a single idea beyond the mere desire of accumu- 
 lating wealth for wealth's sake ; but the man who, 
 when a proposition or suggestion is made him, 
 weighs it well in all its different aspects, and what 
 well matured judgment commends, that he adopts, 
 and having adopted, enters upon its realization, with 
 his whole soul. 

Although every man of ordinary good sense may 
 without difficulty, discriminate between the two, yet 
 the majority will give the penurious fiirmer the credit 
 of making the most money, while in fact, his liberal, 
 economical neighbor's income from a farm of the 
 same size and quality of soil is nearly double. 

I have two neighbors, who in point of character 
 and disposition are perfect antipodes. Both are 
 farmers, and both are desirous of securing a compe- 
 tency, and it is profitable as wed as pleasant to ob- 
 serve, the different methods they adopt to secure their 
 object. 

Mr. A. is a shrewd oborver — a man of more than 
 ordinary intelligence, and always labors with an eye 
 to profit. A few features about his premises will 
 best portray his character. Ilis dwelling is a mod- 
 est looking, but well constructed and convenient 
 building. A neat yard in front is filled with trees, 
 at once ornamental and useful. Every tree and 
 shrub, and plant, is made to serve the double purpose 
 of rendering his home pleasant and profitable. The 

currant, gooseberry, raspberry and other fruit bear- 
 ing plants, that thrive so luxuriantly around the 
 fences, (attesting t'le attention and skill of the own- 
 er,) are all of the best varieties, and when sent to 
 market command the best prices. The same is true 
 of the plums, apricots and peaches that surround his 
 his dwelling. 

His barn is commodious and convenient. Every part 
 of it is arranged with an eye to the comfort and se- 
 curity of his stock, and economy in their food. He 
 has long since learned to know what grains possess 
 the best fertilizing qualities — what gives strength 
 to the muscles of his horses and oxen, and what as- 
 sists most largely in the secretion of milk and pro- 
 motes its richness. His barn yaid is so constructed, 
 that not a drop of liquid manure is wasted. Every 
 kind of material possessing fertilizing qualities is 
 carefully added to the manure heap. His fowls are 
 not permitted to make a roosting place of the feed 
 troughs, rack &c., but a comfortable house accom- 
 modates them, and the manure saved, more than re- 
 pays him for the expense of building. His fence rows 
 are all neat and clean, and his fences in good repair. 
 His implements are all of the most approved kinds, 
 and as a consequence, his lands are well tilled. His 
 fine Devon Cattle, are the admiration of the neigh- 
 borhood and his horses and other stock of a charac- 
 ter admirably adapted to the purposes for which 
 they are intended. As remarked by one of your cor- 
 respondents in your last number, he has "a place 
 for every thing and every thing in its place." He is 
 industrious and frugal, and what must necessarily 
 follow such a methodical system as his, he is 
 growing rich. 

Neighbor B. is as industrious as neighbor A. In 
 fact, he works much harder, but with less profit. Let 
 us glance a moment at his fiirm. His dwelling is a 
 plain structure, but wholly devoid of taste. His 
 paling fence is fast going to ruin. The pigs and 
 chickens are aware of the fact, and have free ingress 
 to the front yard where a few stinted trees, and 
 shrubs continue to prolong their feeble existence. — 
 Not a flower adorns the place. The house the ap- 
 pearance of which a coat of whitewash would 
 greatly improve, presents a dirty forbidding aspect. 
 If you visit his barn, you will find here and there 
 parts of the weather-boarding torn off. Others, which 
 the driving of a nail would save, are ready to follow. 
 Here, as in the front yard, the chickens have full 
 sway. His horses are not remarkable for strength or 
 beanty, nor could it be expected they should be. He 
 never feeds too strong, for fear of injuring them. — 
 His old style of " horse killing," plows, and other 
 implements, aid him very materially in his efforts 
 to prevent his horses from growing too fat. He rises 
 at day-break, and is in the field before the sun, nor 
 does ho leave it until it has sunk below the western 
 horizon. His stables are bady ventilated and his
