I July, 

manure is wasting day by day. His cows, for want 
 of proper attention and food, yield but a scanty quan- 
 tity of milk. His fence rows abound in noxious 
 weeds, and every year the nuisance is becoming 
 greater. All this improvidence, the reader will per- 
 haps be ready to attribute to carelessness. Not, so. 
 If you were to endeavor to persuade him that it 
 would be true economy to repair the paling fence, 
 nail up the weather boarding, or clean his fence 
 rows, he would tell you that he knows it should be 
 done, but he has not time to attend to it. He con- 
 ceives that true economy in farming consists, not in 
 giving attention to such small matters, but in devot- 
 ing all his time to the large operations of the farm, 
 forgetful of the fact that while with his unwieldy im- 
 plements and incessant demands upon the services of 
 his horses, he is fast wearing away their strength 
 and usefulness, his neighbor A. performs an equal 
 amount of Avork, although he does not go to the field 
 until an hour after Mr. B. A. prefers that his horses 
 should have time to eat, well knowing their superior 
 strength and vigor in consequence, will enable him to 
 do more work before the dayisover than his penurious 
 neighbor B; besides which, his implements are all of 
 the latest improved kinds, and save not only his 
 horses, but much valuable time. B. is fully aware 
 of the superiority of A's implements, but his 
 penuriousness induces him to cling to the old ones so 
 long as they can be made to answer his purposes, 
 however badly. In many other points, there are 
 discrepancies in the character of these two men, I 
 might advert to their crops, their mode of plowing, 
 seeding, harvesting, &c., but enough has been said 
 to answer the object I had in view in troubling you 
 with this communication, viz : an earnest desire to 
 impi-ess upon the minds of the younger readers of 
 the Farm Journal, the importance, not merely of 
 economy and industry, but of methodical economy. — 
 My earnest desire is, that the minds of our young 
 men may be thoroughly impressed with the necessi- 
 ty of familiarizing tliemselves, not merely with the 
 physical details of farming, but that they will also 
 apply themselves to those branches of study which 
 stand in intimate alliance with their daily pursuits. 
 My neighbor A, by habits of close study and obser- 
 vation, has fitted himself to pass tolerably correct 
 judgment upon the merits of a new theory or a new 
 implement ; while neighbor B. in a spirit of false 
 economy discards every thing new, and clings to the 
 old system with a pertinacity in this age of progress, 
 rather astonishing. The one is reaping the reward 
 of his observation and true economical spirit, in in- 
 creased wealth ; while the other is realizing a bare 
 subsistence, at the expense of his own and the 
 strength of his horses— the value of his farm stock, 
 and the fertility of his soils.

The Q,uantity ol Nitrogen in Wheat, Corn, Clover, 

&c. 

Mr. Editor : — In an article, headed Agricultural 
 Chemistry, in the May No. of the Journal, there are, I 
 think, some errors ; to which I wish to direct your 
 attention. 

It is very important to Farmers, that scientific 
 statements be clear and intelligible, otherwise they 
 can form but a poor guide for their practical opera- 
 tions. 

The writer alluded to, in speaking of wheat, says : 
 " of the elementary ingredients, nearly one-fourth 
 are nitrogenous, appearing principally as gluten in 
 flour." 

This is allowing entirely too much per centage o 
 nitrogenous substances. Prof. Johnston gives the 
 nitrogenous substances in wheat from 10 to 15 per 
 cent. Boussingault and Liebig at 14 .3 per cent. 

I know that a larger proportion of nitrogenous 
 substances has been found in wheat when manured 
 with highly nitrogenous substances, as urine, blood, 
 etc.; when wheat is raised in gardens, or when south- 
 ern varieties were analyzed, as the hard wheat of 
 Africa. Boussingault grew the same variety of 
 wheat in the open field and in a very rich garden : in 
 the produce of the garden there were 21 .94 per cent 
 of gluten and albumen : in that of the open field no 
 more than 14 .3 per cent of the same principles. 

In the article referred to the writer says : "Indian 
 corn requires very little nitrogen." This, I think, is 
 an error. Indian corn contains (nearly) as great a per 
 centage of nitrogen as wheat; and an acre of corn con- 
 tains far more than an acre of wheat; and the amount 
 of nitrogen consumed by a crop per acre, is the prop- 
 er light for a farmer to view it, in applying manure, 
 at least. If an acre of corn really contains far more 
 nitrogen than an acre of wheat and the farmer should 
 give to the land but little nitrogen in the shape of 
 manure, his crop must fail unless a sufficient amount 
 be furnished to it from the soil and atmosphere. 

Johnston gives the nitrogenous principles in Indian 
 corn, 12 per cent, Boossingault and M. Payen I2i 
 per cent. But the most complete analysis of Indian 
 corn was made by our own countryman, J. H. Sali- 
 bury, and published In a prize essay on that subject. 

All parts of the plant and numerous varieties were 
 submitted to a careful analysis. Three varieties of 
 the Twelve Rowed Flint contained an average of 
 13 .46 per cent of nitrogenous substances ; the high- 
 est of which, the Sioux, 14 .9 per cent. 

In the varieties of eight Rowed yellow the average 
 amount was 15 .1 per cent. Five varieties of White 
 Flint 11 .27 per cent. Four gourd Seed varieties 
 9 .38. The R, I. sweet corn 19 .32 per cent. Three 
 varieties of pop corn 13 per cent of nitrogenous sub- 
 stances. 

The gourd seed it will be seen contains less nitro- 
 gen than the flint ; and of the four gourd seed vari-
