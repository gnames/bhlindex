tried was a stiff clay — altogether too stiff for success- 
 ful gardening. The tan was procured from a neigh- 
 boring tannery, where it had lain probably two years, 
 and Avas applied the thickness of four inches over the 
 beds. It was then spaded in to the depth of a foot. 
 I soon observed the difference, not only in the soil 
 but in the growth of vegetables. A new life seemed 
 to have been imparted to the soil. From being stiff 
 and cold it became friable and warm, and the vege- 
 tables grown where the tan was applied, were not 
 only more vigorous in growth, but several days earli- 
 er. I have strong faith in the virtues of spent tan, 
 and hope that the ignorant prejudice hitherto enter" 
 tained in relation to it will speedily be removed.

[We are glad that spent tan-bark is beginning to 
 be properly appreciated. In a former number we 
 recorded a small but successful experiment made 
 with it in the cultivation of celery. Since then, wo 
 have had another opportunity ef testing its value. 
 When absent in March, we wrote home, giving direc. 
 tions to have a particular bed well manured and 
 spaded for beans. Instead of the bed we ordered to 
 be spaded, the gardener selected another, and mis- 
 taking our directions about the manure to be applied, 
 gave< it a heavy coating of pretty well decomposed 
 tan bark. Not having any very great faith in its 
 virtues as a manure, we were not a little mortified on 
 our return to find our directions so lamely carried 
 out. The beans, however, were planted, germinated 
 lapidly, and at the time of the writing, June 14th, 
 are not only in full blossom, but decidedly the most 
 tl)rifty and vigorous we have seen this season. No 
 other manure was applied, nor had any been applied 
 to this bed for several years previously. 

The soil is a stiff clay, but by the application of 
 the tan has became quite mellow, and appears to re- 
 tain its warmth and moisture much better than any 
 other bed in the garden. — Ed.] 

" Goi 'g to the Bottom of Things." 

Some idea of the great fertility of the soil in por- 
 tions of Iowa, may be formed from the following ex- 
 tract from a letter received from J. K. Pratt, a 
 Pennsylvania farmer, who has located himself in the 
 vicinity of Cedar Falls. lie says, " I have not time 
 now, to give you any of the details of my farming 
 operations here, but will merely remark, in reply to 
 the advice of one of your old farmer correspondents, 
 ' to go to the bottom of the soil,' that his recommen- 
 dation would not apply well in this section of coun- 
 try. Our parsnips, beets and carrots, work on that 
 plan, and frequently go down three or four feet togetto 
 the ' bottom,' but always fail in the attempt, as the 
 depth of soil is too great for them to penetrate. It 
 is hard work to get them out, and I fear, if the same 
 principle of going to the bottom with the plow, were 
 adjptcd, 'no should hjve still harder work with it." 

War against the Curculiu. 

In our last, we called attention to th« wide, and 
 still wider, spreading ravages of the curculio. Since 
 then we visited Philadelphia, where we found the 
 stone fruit nearly all destroyed, and the fruit growers 
 in despair. Not a single person with whom we met 
 appeared to indulge the slightest hope of ever being 
 able to eradicate the pest. All appeared to have 
 settled down to the firm but painful conclusion that 
 the curculio would eventually destroy all our stone 
 fruits. Highly as we respect the opinion of our 
 Philadelphia friends on this subject, we beg leave to 
 differ with them. Nil desperandiim is our motto. — 
 We are not yet prepared believe that human skill 
 and ingenuity will much longer be baffled by the 
 curculio. If the danger be as imminent as they 
 represent it, and we have no doubt it is, let the battle 
 cry bo sounded, and " Death to the curculio" be 
 inscribed on our banner. If we are in danger of 
 losing our most delicious fruits — our apricots, plums 
 nectarines, peaches, cherries, &c., let us at least 
 have the pleasure of striking a blow in their defence; 
 before yielding them to this merciless foe. But how 
 shall we proceed ? Who shall be our leader ? Pro- 
 ceed as you would do, if night after night, your fruit 
 trees were robbed by some mean fellows. Watch 
 for them, until you catch them, and when caught, 
 wait not to ascertain of how much fruit they have 
 robbed you, but into the fire with them at once. You 
 need no leader. A system of tactics effectual in 
 curculio warfare has never yet been laid down. Let 
 every man who has a fruit tree feel that he is its pro- 
 tector, and as such, is duly authorized to inflict pun- 
 ishment upon every thing that would injure his 
 charge. Try every thing. Spread sheets beneath 
 the trees, and every morning early, shake down the 
 fruit. Gather all the fallen fruit and destroy it by 
 boiling' or some other effectual process. Keep fowls 
 in the vicinity of your trees, and if possible, let your 
 porkers have a chance at the foe. Try any thing and 
 every thing. When one effort fails, do not despair ; 
 but make another, and another, and still another, 
 until at length, something will be hit upon, some plan 
 devised, by which the enemy will be routed, and 
 peace and plenty restored to our fruit trees. 

Mr. Editor. — ^WIU you or some of your correspon- 
 dents please inform me what method I shall adopt to 
 prevent my gooseberries from mildewing ? The 
 bushes appear thrifty and fruit well every year, but 
 the berries are Invariably destroyed by the mildew. 
 An answer would greatly oblige, E, T.

[Clean the grass thoroughly beneath the bushes, 

and mulch with any kind of material that will not 

prove injurious to the plant. Salt hay, common 

straw, long manure, spent tan-bark or leaves will 

answer. We have found that a top dressing of com- 
 mon clay will effectually prevent it. — Ed.]
