Shading Plants. 

In my younger days, when setting out celery 
 plants, we docked off a number of leaves to prevent 
 their flagging; we shaved off the points of our pink 
 pippins for a similar purpose, and reduced the leaves 
 of all cuttings on a similar principle. A grand hub- 
 bub was created among some of our young minds 
 when a great gardener, now no more, demonstrated 
 in the Gardener's Magazine, that leaves were the 
 prime movers in the formation of roots ; that the 
 stripping these leaves from a cutting was worse than 
 labor thrown away ; and mutilating a celery plant 
 akin to barbarism. The youngest reader of this 
 work will only require a slight exertion to see thro' 
 the enigma which distracted us amazingly. He will 
 perceive that as there are two ways of telling a story, 
 so the same place may be arrived at by many differ- 
 ent routes ; the old gardener with his somi-savage 
 lopping propensities was not such a numskull after 
 all. He often did the best, with his limited means 
 and conveniences. He well knew that fine heathy 
 leaves could only be sustained by roots in full action 
 and with an abundance of moisture within reach. 
 He knew that, generally speaking, neither cuttings 
 uor celery plants, unless peculiarly well treated, 
 could at once possess the roots in action necessary to 
 sustain transpiration a-nd elaboration through so 
 many fine leaflets, when these were exposed to solar 
 agency. One sweep of his trusty knife lessened the 
 number of these robbers of the stored up energies in 
 his plant or cutting, and saved him many a jog-trot 
 afterward, for seeing if all his shading-from-sunshine 
 paraphernalia were put on and taken off at the right 
 and pi-oper period. His lessening the number of his 
 leaves, lessened the chance of obtaining quickly a 
 sturdy, healthy plant, if the necessary attention to 
 securing a moist atmosphere, and shading from sun- 
 shine could have been attended to ; but then he mar- 
 vellously lessened his cares and troubles respecting 
 them, so that though he lost in time he gained in la- 
 bor. He knew that these leaves evaporated ; if he 
 did know how, he had not the means to prevent 
 them, nay of making them absorb as well as perspire. 

The best gardener is he who suits hin self to his 
 circumstances,and makes the utmost possible of them. 
 Studying trifles, he may do things very differently 
 from his next door neighbor, and 3'et, at the end of 
 a few months, a spectator who had never witnessed 
 these operations would imagine they had been work- 
 ing all along in a similar manner. Thus tested, many 
 new discoveries, and seeming differences, would re- 
 solve themselves, into looking at an object from dif- 
 ferent points of view. The pages of tliie work fur- 
 nish strong confirmations, though we can not now 
 allude to them. Go beyond them, and what is more 
 commonly found than this: "Shade everthing in 
 bright sunshine in summer," says one. "Nonsense" 
 says another ; shade not at all ; how can you expect 
 your plants to bo worth anything, if they receive not 
 the full blaze of our sun, which even then is not 
 80 powerful as that to which our exotics are general- 
 ly exposed in their own climes." " Shade according 
 to the circumstances of j'our plants, and your re- 
 quirements from them," says a third ; and with him 
 we coincide: and, if you cannot shade, use other 
 means, such as sprinkling or syringing, to prevent 
 evaporation, and maintain a certain degree of cool- 
 ness. "Shade ever" in bright sunshine in summer, 
 is just as preposterous to us as "never sliade at ail." 
 Thus, here are a number of cuttings with all their 
 leaves on, protected from the atmosphere by bell- 

{;la88es, and enclosed besides in a pit or frame: al- 
 ow them, even in these circumstances, the full force 

now of a midsummer sun ; and, unless in exceptional 
 cases, arising from the nature of the cutting, the 
 leaves will droop, because they can not derive mois- 
 ture enough from the cutting to supply that outgoing 
 from their evaporating surface: — continue a similar 
 process from day to day, and death will ensue from 
 complete exhaustion. — Cottage Gardener. 

The Ring-Necked Pheasant. 

The Phasianus Torquatus, or ring-necked Pheas- 
 ant, of which the artist has given such a life-like 
 portrait from nature, is but a variety of the com- 
 mon Pheasant. It is, perhaps, a trifle larger than the 
 Brown Pheasant, with which it is associated in al- 
 most every preserve in England. The Cock should 
 weigh about three pounds. 

The following paragraph, which we quote from Mr. 
 Nolan, of Dublin, will be interesting to those who 
 desire to try their skill in breeding and rearing this 
 beautiful bird. He says: — 

" The Pheasant is not only beautiful to the eye, but 
 most delicate when served to the table. Its flesh is 
 considered the greatest dainty. When the old phy- 
 sicians spoke of the wholesomeness of anj' viands, they 
 made their comparison with the flesh of the Pheas- 
 ant. No matter with what care they have been bred 
 or propagated, they disdain the protection of man, 
 and shelter in the thickest covers and remotest for- 
 ests. All others of the Domestic Fowl submit to the 
 protection of man; but the Pheasant never has, pre- 
 ferring the scanty produce of acorns and berries to the 
 abundant supply of a farm-yard. The Hen Pheas- 
 ant, in a wild state, hatches and brings up her brotd 
 with patience, vigilance, and courage ; but when 
 kept tame, she never sits well. A substitute must 
 be found in the clean-legged Bantam, the larger 
 Fowl being too heavy for the Chicks. Her time of 
 laying is about the middle of April, and, if in an 
 aviary, the Eggs should be immediately removed, 
 and placed in dry bran or chaff, until you wish to set 
 them. They are about twenty -four days coming out. 
 After the young ones appear, they are not to be fed 
 for twenty-four hours, after which give them hard- 
 boiled Egg, chopped tine, and mixed with oat-meal, 
 ant-mou d, cheese, curd, lettuce cut fine, white flour 
 wetted with sweet milk, bread crumbs, bread and 
 milk, with very limited drink. Be particular ti) pre- 
 serve them from cold and moisture. You will have 
 to confine the Hen, so as to prevent her eating their 
 food; and you will have to provide tlioni with mag- 
 gots. In the ncigliborhood of Paris, where they rear 
 quantities of young Fowl, for the market, they pre- 
 pare what they call a ver/H(«ee;-, by digging a hole 
 in a dry, sandy spot, in which they place a piece of 
 flesh, which soon gets into maggots, with which they 
 feed the young birds. My own ccrininctr'i^ ot much 
 simpler and economic construction. I have an earth- 
 en pan, about two feet deep, and one foot diameter, 
 into which I put some bran ; on this I place a piece 
 of liver or carrion. I cover it with a common glass 
 cap, and phicc it in the sun. The flesh soon gets f y- 
 blown, and speedily creates quantities of nnggots, 
 and, witli a long-liandlod spoon. I have thtm tliro\\n 
 to the young birds. Thoy should not get nmre than 
 one feed of those in the div. The more vari( d their 
 food, and the more frcqueiitly nMU'wed, \\w. better. 
 Fre.-h, and a little at a time. The green leaves of 
 barley are excellent. At three months old, feed them 
 on biulcy, with a little wheat, bttiled carr its, or po- 
 tatoes, mixed with broad crumbs. Giv(^ a small p: r- 
 tion of boiled rice during the moult. If tl e}' s'lou'd 
 get the roup, give them fresh curd every day. To 
 make alum curd, take new milk, as much as your
