THE RING-NECKED PHEASANT. 

young birds require, and boil it with a lump of alum, 
 so as not to make the curd hard and tough, but cus- 
 tard-like. A little of this curd and ant's eggs, should 
 be given to them twice a day, in addition to their 
 other food. Keep their vessels clean ; and, if the 
 disease still continue, give them every second day, a 
 small dose of garlic in a little fresh butter. They 
 are subject to be vent-bound, which, if not attended 
 to, will kill them. The remedy is, with a sharp scis- 
 sors cut close the down or feathers about the vent, 
 and anoint it with sweet-oil, and be attentive that 
 it be kept clean, otherwise you cannot rear them; 
 but, in handling them, be particularly cautious that 
 you do it with the greatest delicacy, as the least 
 rough handling will kill them. If they have a 
 scouring, the alum curd will check it. 

There is no difficulty in breeding the common 
 Pheasant in a wild state ; but to keep them in an 
 aviary, you will have to get a wire-trellis in front, suf- 
 ficiently close to prevent the sparrows and other birds 
 robbing them of their food. The saving of the food 
 will very soon compensate you for the wire-work, and 
 insure your Pheasants being fed. At the top, I would 
 prefer close net-work of moderate-sized cord, well 
 painted. The reason is, if the birds get fluttered, 
 thej' fly straight up, and, by a dash against a hard 
 substance, they frequently fall dead, but by coming 
 in contact with the net, they receive no injury. Part 
 of the aviary should be shedded, to protect them 
 from the inclemency of the weather ; and I would 
 recommend a retiring-place for the Hens to lay in, 
 and perches of about one inch in diameter. I would 
 advise the retiring-place to be laid down with clean 
 straw, but would prefer fine sand for their walking- 
 place. Wheat and barley are their best food, with 
 occasionally vegetable matter, lettuce, turnip-tops, 
 cabbages, &c. One Cock is sufiicient for three or 
 four Hens.

From the 15th to the 25th of September, sow the 
 seed in an open border. Let the plants remain until 
 the 20th of October, when they will be small, having 
 four leaves. Plant them out four inches, apart in a 
 pit or frame, where you can protect them from the 
 winter's frost ; let them remain there until the first 
 week in January, then prepare your pit to grow them 
 in. 

The pit should be eight feet wide, three feet deep 
 in front, and four at the back. Get one load of leaves 
 and one load of hot stable manure — I mean in this 
 proportion ; have the leaves and manure well mixed 
 a week or two before you intend to use it,and then fill 
 the pit to what will settle down to twelve or fourteen 
 inches, take then and get your soil, old sod three 
 parts, and on 3 part manure — hog manure isthe best; 
 cover your bed over to the depth of at least eighteen 
 inches, dig it nicely, then put on the sashes and keep 
 them close for three days, when the little heat that 
 the manure and leaves have created will be sufiicient 
 to give the plants a start. This is all that is necessa- 
 ry, for if there be too much heat, it will spoil all. — 
 Then mark out your bed, two rows to each sash, 
 which should be three feet ten inches, and two inch- 
 es for the wood of the rafters. 

It will be understood that the plants were pricked- 
 out in rows, so that they could be taken up with the 
 trowel without breaking any of the ball ; set them 
 five plants in the row, and two rows to each sash ; 
 you plant lettuce between each plant in the row, and 
 a drill of short-top turnip radishes between them. — 
 After you have all planted, let the sashes remain 
 close for a day or two, when they will begin to show 
 they have taken to the ground. You must then give 
 all the air you possibly can, even take the sashes en- 
 tirely off in good weather. They must be covered 
 every night with straw mats and shutters until the first 
 of March, or longer, according to the season.
