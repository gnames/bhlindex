By the 10th of March they will require to be -vrat- 
 ered twice a week ; leave off the sash every day you 
 can : by the first of April give plenty of water, and 
 by this means you can grow early cauliflowers as 
 good as in any part of the world. I have grown 
 them four, five, and nearly six pounds. For the truth 
 of this statement, as to weight, etc., I refer you to 
 the Transactions of the Pennsylvania Horticultural 
 Society, from 1833 until 1837, both years included.

The Siamese Hog. 

The Chinese Hog is to be met with in the south- 
 eastern countries of Asia, as Siam, Cochin China, the 
 Burman empire, Cambodia, Malacca, Sumatra, and 
 in Batavia, and other eastern islands. There are va- 
 rieties of the hog in India and China, and hence the 
 occasional confusion of nomenclature met with in 
 books of natural history. 

There are two well-marked varieties of the Chinese 
 hog — that from Siam, and that from China proper. — 
 The chief, if not onl}^ point of difference subsist- 
 ing between them is, however, in color — the Siamese 
 variety being usually black and the Chinese white. 
 Neither of these hogs, however, present constant uni- 
 formity in this respect, their color frequently varying, 
 and black hogs coming from China, while white ones 
 are brought from Siam. Even in the same litter, pigs 
 of different colors have frequently been seen, and in- 
 stances of the occurence of 2->ie'i individuals. In the 
 case of all animals submitted to the influence of do- 
 mestication, color alone is by no means a safe criter- 
 ion in the enumeration of varieties. 

The Chinese hog is of small size. His body is very 
 nearly a perfect cylinder in form ; the back slopes 
 from the shoulder, and is hollow, while the belly is 
 pendulous, and in a fat specimen almost touches the 
 ground. The ear is small and short, inclines to be 
 semi-erect, and usually lies rather backward. The 
 Ijone is small, the legs fine and short. The bristles 
 are so soft as rather to resemble hair. The skin it- 
 self i3, in the Siamese variety, of a rich copper color, 
 and the hair black, which gives to the general color 

of the animal somewhat the effect of bronzing. In 
 the Chinese variety, the color is usually white, some- 
 times black, and occasionally pied. The white sort 
 are deemed preferable, from the superior delicacy of 
 their flesh. The face and head of the Chinese pigs 
 are unlike those of aii}" other description of swine, 
 somewhat resembling a calf. 

Both the Siamese and Chinese hogs are very good 
 feeders, arrive early at maturity (a most important 
 particular in any description of live stock,) and feed 
 flit, on less food, and become fatter and heavier with- 
 in a given time, than any of our European varieties. 
 The Chinese value the hog very highly; they live 
 more upon pork than on any other description of an- 
 imal food; and it is said that they even use the milk 
 of the sow. 

The Chinese take groat care of their swine, and pay 
 particular attention to the quality and quantity of 
 their food, feeding them at regular and stated inter- 
 vals. They do not permit them to walk, but when 
 necessary, have them carried from one place to anoth- 
 er. They keep the beds and styes of their hogs scru- 
 pulously dry and clean ; it is to this attention that we 
 are possibly to attribute the excellent qualities of 
 Chinese pork. 

The Chinese hogs that we generally see in this 
 country come principally from the vicinity of Canton, 
 brought thence as sea stock. It is scarely to be re- 
 gretted that this breed is not sufiicicntly hardy to 
 thrive in our climate. From this circumstance, wo 
 are compelled to limit the advantages we might oth- 
 erwise derive from its introduction to crossing with 
 our own coarser domestic breeds of swine. For this 
 purpose it is truly valuable; and the improved race, 
 thus produced, is infinitely superior even to its Chi- 
 nese progenitor, the latter, in a pure state, being too 
 small, and hence answering rather for pork than ba- 
 con, besides fattening even too easihj. Both these 
 objections are obviated in the cross, which has furth- 
 er the efi"ect of restoring diminished fecundity. — Rich-

A HOG washed weekly with soap and a brush will 
 be found to thrive, and put up flesh in a ratio of at 
 least 5 to 3, in compai'ison to a pig not so treated.
