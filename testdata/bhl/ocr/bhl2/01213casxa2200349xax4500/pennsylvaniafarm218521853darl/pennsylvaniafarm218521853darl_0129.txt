THORXY CLOT-BUR, PRICKLEY CLOT-BUR. BUR THISTLE. 

Xanthium strumarium, Linn. 
 Its generic name is derived from the Greek Xan- 
 thos, yellow ; because it was used, according to An- 
 thos, to die the hair yellow. Botanists have found 
 some difficulty in finding the proper place for this 
 plant. Linnoeus, in his Artificial System, placed it 
 in his 21st class, Moncccia, and 5th order Feniandria, 
 but it is now generally put in the 17th class Syngene- 
 sia, and 4th order Polygamia Necessaria. 

In the Natural System almost every writer has as- 
 signed it a new situation, but Torrey & Grey in their 
 Flora of North America have placed in it their 74th 
 order Compositce, Tribe Seneciodece, sub-tribe Melam- 
 podinea, and under Division, Ambrosidce, where it 
 appears to properly belong. 

Nine species are known, two of these are natives 
 of the United States, but the one under consideration 
 is a native of the south of Europe, where it is a vile 
 pest indeed. It was first introduced into this coun- 
 try in the South, from whence it has extended itself 
 in every direction. In 1820, it made its appearance 
 in Pennsylvania near Philadelphia ; in 1835, it was 
 found in Chester county ; in 1840, I found it in the 
 vicinity of Wrightsville, York county, and now it is 
 found along the river as high up as Clinton county. 

Its obnoxious character is but little remote from 
 the Canada Thistle, for which it has been mistaken. 
 It grows three or four feet high, and is much branch- 
 ed. The leaves are one to three inches long, one- 
 fourth to three-fourths of an inch wide, egg shaped 
 but tapering to a point ; the upper surface is pale 
 green ; the under surface covered with short hairs of 
 a grey color. The foot stalk is short, on each side 
 of which is a three forked spine, each about an inch 
 long, and very sharp, of a pale utraw color. 
 '. The sterile and fertile flowers occupy different 
 heads, which are solitary in the axils of the upper 
 leaves, the heads nearly the shape of a guinea's egg, 
 but small, covered with hooked prickles which form 
 a rough bur. These burs often get into the fleece of 
 sheep during winter, and almost ruin it. The whole 
 plant is extremely objectionable and quite difficult to 
 eradicate, if not prevented from perfecting its seed. 
 It is, however, an annual, and if kept mowed down, 
 will in a few years disappear, but a great coarse thor- 
 ny weed, four feet high, producing thousands of 
 seeds requires some energy to be kept in subjugation, 
 but let it bo promptly eradicated whenever it first 
 appears. ^ J. M. M'Minn.

Cultivation of Tomatoes. 

Mr. Editor : Since the once despised tomato has 
 grown to be a general favorite, a remark or two, 
 tending to promote its successful growth and early 
 ripening may perhaps not prove uninteresting. For 
 many years I have cultivated this delightful and 
 wholesome vegetable, having formed a partiality for 
 it, long befi)re it became so general a favorite as now 
 and am fully satisfied that most of the improvements 
 in its culture, suggested by those who appear desi- 
 rous of seeing their names in print, are in fact no 
 improvements at all. To-day a reformer in the art of 
 cultivating them, tells us, that the tomato flourishes 
 no where so well as in the very poorest soil. To-mor- 
 row another with equal pertinacity, assures us a 
 deep, rich loam is decidedly the best. A third ad- 
 vises the pinching off of the side stems as rapidly as 
 they appear. Now for my part, I have found, after 
 some fifteen years cultivation, that soil of a middling 
 quality not only produces the thriftiest vines, but the 
 best flavored fruit ; and I have learned moreover, 
 that the pinching off of the side stems, &c., while it 
 may possibly bring the fruit to a sickly, decaying 
 maturity a few days earlier, also gives it an unpleas- 
 ant acidity. Pruning tomatoes, like cutting away 
 the leaves of the grape vine, to give the cluster a 
 chance to see the sun more frequently and for a long- 
 er time, is a violation of one of nature's laws, and as 
 such cannot but be attended with bad results. Here 
 is my plan, which is natural and consequently sim- 
 ple, and by pursuing it steadily, I find that my to- 
 matoes are just as early as those cultivated by some 
 of my neighbors upon the improved plans. 

My plants are grown in a cold frame. I sow them 
 thin in order that the plants may grow strong. If 
 by chauco they are sown too thickly in one spot, I 
 thin them out at once, while they are very small.â€” 
 This gives me stout, stocky plants which do not re- 
 nuire to be transplanted into other frames to strength- 
 en, and lose by the transplanting all they have gain- 
 ed in the frame. So soon as the weather will admit, 
 I set them out on the south side of a close board 
 fence, planting them quite close to the fence. This 
 o-ives the branches the benefit of the warm sun near- 
 ly the whole day ; while the roots penetrating tc the 
 cool moist soil on the northern side of the fence take 
 up the food necessary for the sustenance of the plant, 
 readily and rapidly. So soon as they are too large 
 to stand without assistance, I lay ssme brush in front 
 of them which keeps them from tlie ground ; and 
 from the fact of their being planted on the southern 
 side of the fence, the branches all tend southward, 
 thus giving the fruit the benefit of a full exposure to 
 thfi warm sun. By this simple plan, I secure large, 
 well flavored and early tomatoes. Thorough hoeing 
 every two or three days is far better than pinching 
 oS" the leaves or branches. E. A. Stilling.
