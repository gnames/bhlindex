IMPOIITAKT TO FARMERS! 

JESSE ROBERT'S PATENT UNITED STATES 
 GRAIN AND SEED FAN. 

TO WniCH WAS AWARDED THE 

FIRST PREMIUM 

At the Pennsylvania Agricultural Fa;r, after atrial the fairness of 
 which could not be disputed. These Fans, the inventor conhdent- 
 ly asserts, are the only ones now in use entirely adequate to the 
 wants of the farmer. The object of the inventor was not directed 
 alone, to the purpose of cleaning grain, but of cleaning it and 
 saving at the same time the farmer the trouble of gathering it 
 from the floor, thus not only avoiding labor, but keeping the grain 
 from the dirt on the floor. In addition to this, these Fans, possess 
 greater advantages than those constructed upon the old plan. — 
 These advantages are as follows : 

First. The arrangement is such, that a quick shake can be ob- 
 tained bv turning slowly, thus sesuring when desired, a leas quan- 
 tity of for small seeds. 

Second. When necessary a slow shake can be secured, by rapid 
 turning. This is of immense advantage, as it adapts the fan, to 
 the cleaning of all kinds of seeds. 

Third, Ane^v method of adjusting the riddles and screws. This 
 gives the operator the advantage of placing them in any position 
 has. adapted to accomplish the purposes of a grain Fan. Every 
 riddle and screen has a separate adjustment, so that each one can 
 be fixed at any angle without the necessity of taking them out. 

Fourth, The grain, instead of falling on the floor, as is usualtv 
 the case, is discharged, by means of a small trough, into the hai}" 
 bushel, or other measure that may be placed under it. By this ai- 
 rangeinent the grain is all measured, by the time it is cleaned, 
 thus saving not only labor, but time, and consequently expense, as 
 well as keeping the grain from contact with the dust and dirt on 
 fl<jor. For this reason; the fan, can be put in operation anywhere, 
 with as little trouble as the common fans can be used iii a barn 
 floor. 

Fifth, The simplicity of their constructions renders them less 
 liable to get out of repair than other mills. 

For the above reasons, we confidently recommend our Fans tD 
 public patronage. Privileges to manufacture will be granted on 
 reasonable terms. Satisfactory informatimi can be promptly had 
 by addressing postpaid, the subscriber at Norristown, Montgome-
