liandreth's Seed Farm. 

The following' account of Landreth's celebrated 
 seed farm, will prove interesting to our readers. We 
 copy it from tliat excellent paper the Germantown 
 Telegraph, than which no other has done more for 
 the cause of agriculture. The Telegraph was, we 
 believe, the first newspaper in Pennsylvania, in 
 which^an agricultural department was introduced, 
 and its spirited and enterprising editor deserves the 
 thanks of the farming community for this commenda- 
 ble step. 

It will be seen tliat the account of Mr. Landreth's 
 farm is from the minutes of the Farmers' Club, an as- 
 sociation composed of about a dozen intelligent gen- 
 tlemen of Philadelphia county, who meet alternately 
 at the respective farms of each, and spend a day in 
 the examination of the crops, mode of culture, &c. as 
 well as interesting discussions on subjects connected 
 with agricultural pursuits. We shall take occasion 
 hereafter to publish portions at least of their proceed- 
 ings for the benefit of our readers, at the same time 
 remarking tiiat the establishment of such clubs in 
 every township in the State, would prove not only a 
 matter of interest to all concerned, but a source of 
 great value to the cause of agriculture generally : 

The Club mot at Bloomdale, the residence of D. 
 Landreth, Esq., on the 18th of June. As we pre- 
 viously, in a report of a Club meeting held at Blooms- 
 dale, about a year since, described somewhat in de- 
 tail, tliis beautiful, extensive, and interesting estate, 
 we shall only enumerate some striking features in the 
 system, and the general modus operandi pursued by 
 Mr. L. It is proper however to state, that Blooms- 
 dale is situated about two miles above Bristol, on the 
 Delaware river, and consists of about two hundred

and fifty acres of fine land, devoted exclusively to 
 the culture of Garden Seeds. The quantity produc- 
 ed is immense, and the quality inferior to none sup- 
 plied from any other source. 

Mr. L.'s customers reside principally south and 
 west of New York, extending to the Rio Grande and 
 the shores of the Pacific. In no important town, in- 
 deed in scarcely a hamlet within that vast area, are 
 they unknown, and it has been computed that in 
 nealy three hundred thousand families in the U. S. 
 "Landreth's Garden Seeds" are household words, 
 while from his exportations to the West Indies, South 
 AnTerica and British Possessions in Asia, they are 
 widely known abroad. 

Mr. L. does not profess to raise all the seeds he 
 vends, but gives his personal attention to those varie- 
 ties that require greater care, employing others in this 
 country and in Europe to produce those demanding 
 less supervision. This system was established by 
 the father of Mr. L. many years since, and has been 
 continued with the fullest success and satisfaction to 
 both vender and purchaser. 

He informed the club that his expenses for manure 
 had not been so great as usual for the current year. 
 The land which had suffered much under the "skin- 
 ning" system, prior to Mr. L. coming into posses- 
 sion, is now rapidly regaining its natural fertility, 
 and will in future require a less copious supply of the 
 fertilizers, though, as Mr. L. informed us, he will 
 continue to apply manure always with the primarj 
 crops. 

The whole plantation, large as it is, annually re- 
 ceives a dressing with manur.% a portion of which 
 applied this spring, was $500 worth of Peruviaa 
 guano — principally on the bean crops ; and he thinks 
 that the guano is admirably adapted to the Brassica 
 tribe, including turnips, cabbages, ruta baga, radish 
 and other cuciform plants. 

He informed us, however, that his main reliance 
 was on street dirt from the city, whicli is composted
