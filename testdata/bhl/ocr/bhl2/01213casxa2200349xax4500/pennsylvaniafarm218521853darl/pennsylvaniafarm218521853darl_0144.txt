with stable manure from the same source and the 
 produce of his barn-yard. 

The live stock of the farm consists of eight horses 
 for farm work, three mules, one pair of working 
 oxen, and two cows. He purchases his butter, as he 
 finds it less costly than making it. 

Among other striking improvements at Bloomsdale 
 since the meeting of the Club there in '51, we no- 
 ticed a large, symetrical building which, as we are 
 informed, is intended as a seed drying house, for 
 which it appeared admirably adapted ; also a double 
 cottage for workmen, seven families of whom reside 
 on the place, and with whom the single laborers 
 board. Beside these several other dwellino-s and 
 drying houses have been erected within a few years 
 — the roofs of which as well as that recently put on 
 the main barn, (which is perhaps one of the largest 
 in the country) are all of slate. They form an excel- 
 lent roof, give the building an improved appearance, 
 and, as we were informed, and as we believe, it is the 
 cheapest roof in the end. There is an unusual de- 
 gree of ingenuity and taste displayed in the construc- 
 tion, particularly the internal arrangement, as well 
 as in the relative position and convenience of all the 
 buildings. They are painted with mineral paint, ap- 
 plied and contrasted with good taste. We were par- 
 ticularly struck with the great care that had been 
 taken and expense incurred to prevent a possibility 
 of the various small seeds being mixed. The same 
 care and attention is also given in their production — 
 the extent and variety of which, would seem to 
 make it almost impracticable. 

That our readers may form some idea of the com- 
 plexity, and extent of the system there practiced, we 
 have collected a catalogue of some of the principle 
 crops and the era of each, which we annex — omitt- 
 ing miscellaneous minor crops.

By Mr. L's system the bean crop follows the pea, 
 and other crops succeed those planted in the spring 
 — thus securing two crops in the same year from the 
 same land, the advantages of which it is evident, 
 must be very great in many respects. 

We were informed that bulb seed generally, one 
 year old, will grow better than new, but that they 
 win fee about three days later sprouting than new 

seed ; also that all the root crops except the beet and 
 carrot may stand out as they grow, if designed for 
 seed the next year. 

There is a great length of wagon road between 
 the several crops on the place, all which was in beau- 
 tiful order — the weeds being destroyed, the ruts filled, 
 and the surface neatly graded and levelled by passing 
 over them Wilkinson's Patent Rut Scraper. 

The lawn, which had been a long time in grass, 
 and which appeared at the time of our previous 
 meeting to be running out, was now vigorous and 
 verdant — it having been resuscitated by re-seeding 
 and the application of guano. 

There was little time for the discussion of any 
 other matters than those alike numerous and interest- 
 ing, that presented themselves on all sides of us a j 
 we walked and rode over Bloomsdale farm. There 
 was however an interchange of opinion between 
 some of the members of the Club on harvesting and 
 marketing the small cereals. 

The Yellows in Peach Trees. 

The prevalence of this disease in many parts of 
 the United States, and the contrariety of opinion in 
 reference to its origin, contagiousness and remedy, 
 all serve to render it a subject of interest to the Hor- 
 ticulturist. Although various theories in regard to it 
 have been advanced, no single one seems yet to have 
 claimed more than a mere passing notice. It is not 
 our intention to lay down any particular theory in 
 relation to it, but simply to call attention to some 
 facts, which have fallen under our observation, and 
 which may prove useful hints, upon which more ex- 
 perienced horticulturists may improve. And we here 
 take occasion to say that we do not believe the disease 
 to be either contagious or incurable. 

With reference to its contagiousness, we shall feel 
 bound to believe it, so soon as any thing analagous 
 to it in the vegetable kingdom is discovered ; but until 
 then, we prefer being classed with the skeptics, 
 waiting patiently till more minute investigation and 
 research shall satisfactorily determine the true cause 
 of it. 

Neither do we believe the disease to be incurable ; 
 and for the follo^ving reasons : 

Last season \te took possession of a small orchard 
 which contained a number of peach trees of the 
 choicest varieties. The owner, a gentlemen of intel- 
 ligence, and also a skilful horticulturist, requested 
 as a favor; that a dozen or more of the trees which 
 presented unmistakeable evidences of the yellows, 
 might be removed, root and branch. Deference for 
 his superior judgment induced us to comply in part 
 with his request. Half a dozen trees were removed, 
 and the balance reserved for experiments. We can- 
 not better describe their condition at the time we took 
 charge of them, than by by quoting from ",Downing
