Fruits and Fruit Trees of America." He says the 
 infallible symptoms of the Yellows are the following : 

1. The production upon the' branches of very 
 slender wiry slioots, a few inches long and bearing 
 starved,Tiiminutive leaves. These leaves are not pro- 
 truded from the extremetics, but from latent buds on 
 the main portion of the stem and large branches. — 
 The leaves are very narrow and small, quite distinct 
 from those of the natural size, and are either pale, 
 yellow, or destitute of color. 

2. The premature ripening of the fruit. This takes 
 place from two to four weeks earlier than the pi'oper 
 season. The first season of the disease it grows to 
 nearly its natural size ; the following season it is not 
 more than half or a fourth of that size ; but is always 
 marked externally, (whatever be the natural color) 
 with specks and large spots of purplish red. Inter- 
 nally, the flesh is more deeply colored, especially 
 around the stone,, than in the natural state." 

Several of the reserved trees being of the choicest 
 varieties, we concluded they were worth an efibrt to 
 save them. Our first step was to cut away the 
 branches that appeared most aS'ected. We then 
 headed in the remainder, pretty severely, after which 
 cinders from the locomotives on the Columbia Rail 
 Road were applied to a depth of six inches, the 
 dressing extending as far as the extremities of the 
 branches. The cinders were then turned under full 
 epadc deep. We saw no immediate improvement, 
 and were led to fear that our trouble had been for 
 naught. This spring, however, we were most agree- 
 ably surprised to find every tree thus treated' putting 
 forth leaves as vigorously as any of the other trees in 
 the orchard ; and at the present time, July 18, they 
 are all apparently, as vigorous and healthy as ever 
 they were. The fruit upon them gives no indication of 
 premature ripening, while the new growth of wood 
 exceeds twelve inches. As coal is used to a certain 
 extent upon the locomotives from which the the cin- 
 ders were procured, that fact should not be forgotten. 
 Besides which a considerable quantity of ashes was 
 mixed with them. 

In stating these facts, we have no desire to be under- 
 stood as asserting locmotivecoal cinders to be a specific 
 for the yellows ; but we do think that it furnishes con- 
 clusive evidence, that the disease is not wholly with- 
 out a remedy. It ofiers encouragement to renewed 
 experiments, and may possibly lead to results which 
 have long been sought for. 

Age of Sheep. — The age of sheep may be known 

by the front teeth. They are eight in number, and 

appear the first year, all of a size. In the second 

year the two middle ones fall out, and their place is 
 supplied by two large ones. In the third year a 
 small tooth on each side. In the fourth year the 
 large teeth are six in number. In the fifth year the 
 whole front teeth are large. In the sixth year the 
 whole begin to get worn.

Mr. Editor: Mrs. Pierson, has, I perceive, con- 
 descended to notice my short paper, on Lunar Influ- 
 ence, wliich appeared in your May number. After 
 a careful reading of her reply, I hardly know wheth- 
 er a continuance in the discussion on this question, 
 with that excellent lady, will be of any benefit in its 
 further elucidation, because of the exceeding caustic 
 remarks she Avas pleased to make, in reference to 
 those, (myself included,) who are not implicit believ- 
 ers in " the divine art of Astrology ;" and the utter 
 contempt she entertains for the light of " modern sci- 
 ence." On the first, she remarks : "It would appear 
 that Medicus, in common with his kindred blasphe- 
 mers of the moon, do not know that the divine doc- 
 trine of Astrology, including the nodic zodiacic influ- 
 ence of the moon, in conjunction with the planets, 
 is a veritable science, and not a phantom of dark- 
 ness, and ofi'spring of superstitious ignorance." It is 
 true, Medicus does not believe Astrology to be a divine 
 doctrine, any more than the modern humbug of 
 " Spiritual Knocking." 

Concerning modern science which we suppose 
 means modern scientific discoveries, we are thus ad- 
 dressed. " In this, as in every other instance, modern 
 science bears about the same relation to truth, that 
 atheism does to God, and the proud sneers of the one 
 against the subject of its enmity equally with the su- 
 percilious ridicule of the other, will perish in con- 
 tempt, while the great principles which they have 
 impotcntly assailed, remain glorious and unimpaired 
 forever." Now, sir, although these are severe re- 
 marks, yet you will perceive they contain no argu- 
 ments, cither in favor of Astrology, or against mod- 
 ern science ; and had they been uttered by a gentle- 
 man, I should not hesitate for a moment to make 
 free use of refutation, but, to remove au excrescence. 
 But their author, belongs to that gentle and lovely 
 portion of the community, for whom I entertain the 
 most profund regard — and rather than be ungentle, 
 or discourteous to one of the sex, I will be willing to 
 rest under the imputation of being, a "blasphemer of 
 the moon," and an " Astrological Athiest " all my 
 life. 

First I am asked to separate the injlnenrc from the 
 light of the moon. !Most are aware that the moon, 
 as a body, like our globe, possesses attractive power, 
 and in proportion as She approaches the Earth 
 so that infleunce increases, — hence, when she is in 
 her pcrii/ee, the tides rise the highest, and the re- 
 verse, when she is in her ajiogee. Now, this attrac- 
 tive influence is easily discovered to be quite distinct 
 from the light reflected from the face ot the moon 
 upon our globe ; this light coming from the groat 
 fountain of light — the Sun. And just as the bright
