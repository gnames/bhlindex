surface of steel on glass, that reflects light, is not the 
 light, so, the moon, is not the light she reflects. 

We are next directed to the cases of several unfor- 
 tunate beings, who in clear day light, cut their throats, 
 or jumped into -vyells, but who are now gone, 
 " To that eternal shore, 

Where moons shall wax, and wane no more." 
 And all these dire calamities happened, it seems, at 
 different changes of the moon ! To these statements 
 we make no objections, they bring all arguments on 
 our side of the question. Next, we are told, "every 
 ' old woman ' knows, that nature has certain peri- 
 ods rounded by a period of about twenty-nine days." 
 Medicus, Ave believe knows this too, Avho begi to re- 
 fer L. J. P. to Prof. R. Gaoch's work on this delicate 
 subject. (Page 15.) Next in order we are directed 
 to Prof. Cannings article — we have read it and find 
 it does not in direct terms claim lunar influence, but 
 believes that certain atmospheric variations are dis- 
 tinguished by Physiological and Pathological chang- 
 es. For which he observes, "We can reasonably in- 
 fer then, that the moon has an influence on vital ac- 
 tions." This whole matter, wc see, rests on and is 
 resolved into a simple supposition. The latter por- 
 tion of Mrs. Pierson's article being the result of lier 
 own experience, we will not attempt to controvert it. 
 But promise, should we ever make similar experi- 
 ments, and find them caused by lunar influence, we 
 will without delay apprise her of the result.

Philadelpliia, July 9th, 1852. 

An Experiment for Believers as well as Skeptics. 

The belief obtains to some extent, in this country, 
 that certain operations in farming are more advanta- 
 geously done when the moon is in the ascending 
 node, (or according to some almanacs when it points 
 up,) and that others should be done when the moon is 
 in the descending node, or points down. Some be- 
 lieving that a post planted when the moon points up, 
 will have some tendency to draw up and will not 
 stand well, and that this influence extends to the 
 time of sowing seed and putting out manure, &c. — 
 I observe in the Farm Journal for July, that Lydia 
 Jane Pierson proposes a method to determine the 
 truth of it, viz : By laying a board on the grass when 
 the moon is in the descending node, and another 
 when it is in the ascending node. The first of which 
 she says will settle close to the earth, whilst the oth- 
 er will not. This mode of proving the theory of that 
 kind of lunar influence, if carried out to sufficien': 
 extent, seeme to be fair, and what can be tried so 
 easily should not remain doubtful. If the theory is 
 true, wo are entitled to its advantages; if it is not 
 true, it should cease to interfere with our operations. 
 I therefore propose to those who have time and incli- 
 nation, to make experiments for the extension of her 

plan as follow.', in order to render it more conclusive, 
 viz : Provide 90 small pieces of board of equal size, 
 say 3 inches square, or larger ; select a piece of grass 
 ground, on which lay one piece each day till all are 
 laid, taking care that they shall not be disturbed, or 
 moved, till one month after the last piece has been 
 laid. Mow a space each week sufficient for laying 
 the pieces to be laid that week. If the theory is true, 
 it will appear at the end of the time by each series 
 of 14 or 15, differing from a like number immediate- 
 ly preceding and following, throughout the whole 
 number, one part lying as if attracted to the ground, 
 and the other part as if repelled from it. If no such 
 appearance presents, the theory may, as regards that 
 kind of action, be presumed to be false. There is no 
 doubt that matters thrown on the ground, sometimes 
 do adhere more closely to the earth than at other 
 times, when circumstances do not seem to be differ- 
 ent, v/hich I have supposed might be owing to the 
 moist or dry state of the ground. Attention should 
 therefore be given to the amount of rain, and time 
 of falling, and to all other matters that may have in- 
 fluence. 

Again. She says that briars, if cut down when the 
 moon is old, and in the sign of the heart, if they do 
 not die at once they will never thrive but dwindle 
 away and perish. I believe that common black ber- 
 ry briars are in such state in August that they may 
 be more effected by cutting off then, than at other 
 times of the year. On the 14th of August, of the 
 present year, the moon is in the last day of the last 
 quarter, and in the sign of the heart. I therefore 
 propose to experimenters, who have briars to cut, 
 that they cut a portion of them on the afternoon of 
 the 14th, and another portion on the 22nd, when the 
 moon will be about the first quarter, for the purpose 
 of testing the lunar influence in that matter. I think 
 these experimerts worth the attention of those that 
 believe, and those that do not believe in these kinds 
 of lunar influence, and I hope that they may be tried 
 by many, and the results communicated to the Editor 
 of the Farm Journal, who I do not doubt will be wil- 
 ling to give a short abstract of the result. I hope 
 moreover, that all will be made under equal circum- 
 stances, as nearly as may be, and that we shall ar- 
 rive at the same conclusion. C.

[We commend the above to the attention of those 
 of our readers who feel interested in determining the 
 question whether the moon does or does not exercise 
 an influence upon vegetation, fence making. Sic. — 
 For the following reasons we conceive the settle- 
 ment of tliis question to be important. If the moon 
 does not exert the influence attributed to her, it is 
 high time that the thousands of farmers whose time
