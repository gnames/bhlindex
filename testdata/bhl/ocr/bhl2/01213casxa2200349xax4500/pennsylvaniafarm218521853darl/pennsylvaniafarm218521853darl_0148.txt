I August, 

cellent plan I admit, but one the precedent of which, 
 I presume, was not found in our respected mother's 
 gardening system. Here, too, we find E. A. S. taking 
 a step in advance of his preceptress.', Lastlj^ he 
 hiys brush under them, when too heavy to support 
 themselves, which I think,not only a'wide departure 
 from nature's plan, but a decidedly Avrong course to 
 be pursued. The tomato plant, so soon as the points 
 touch the ground, begin to take root, at those points 
 in a manner similar, (though not exactly) to the run- 
 ners of the Strawberry. There was evidently a de- 
 sign in this, on the part of nature and that design 
 appears to mc to be the strengthening of the plant, 
 in its powers of production. Being of rank growth, 
 as well as a rank produce, it would seem but reason- 
 able, that depriving the plant of the nourishment, 
 which these root joints would aiford it, cannot but 
 weaken the size of the plant as well as its fruit pro- 
 ducing qualities. 

So much for E. A. S's. plan, and now for mine 
 which is similar in nearly every respect, except the 
 placing of brush under them. This I never do, for 
 the reasons above given, neither do I pinch off the 
 leaves and side branches, (in this particular also, 
 agreeing with him,) but I do select the best soil I 
 have in my garden, and have always found them to 
 succeed best in such.

In the spirit of this injunction, a work has recently 
 appeared, which illustrates how Pennsylvania Friends 
 of the last generation, while cultivating the soil with 
 industry and success, and training- up their children 
 in the way in wliich they should go, some of them 
 found time to do great good in other respects, and when 
 they went to their rest, left a happy example and a 
 wide extended and blessed influence behind them. It 
 is entitledjMemoir of Philip and Rachel Price,and was 
 written by their son Eli K. Price of the Philadelphia 
 bar: a name well known throughout the State, as 
 that of a man of intelligence ; of distinguished suc- 
 cess in his profession ; and who, for years, has had 
 the command of public confidence, with habits as sim- 
 ple and unassuming as those of the Friends he repre- 
 sents. It is addressed to his parents by name, as to 
 spirits still living ; and signed with his own name, 
 as in the actual realization of a continued existence be- 
 yond the grave, which too many of us forget; and the 
 full belief that our friends still look down upon us from 
 the spirit land and recognize wlien we address them. 
 It is written throughout in the form of a letter to de- 
 parted friends : — so far as we are aware, an original 
 form of memorial. 

Enclosed are some extracts, upon matters connect- 
 ed with tlie objects of the Farm Journal, which will, 

probably, be read with interest, by many of your sub- 
 scribers. * * * 

History of a Chester County Farm. 
 In 1791, Philip Price bought the plantation lying 
 between West Chester and the Brandywine. At this 
 time, like much of the surrounding covmtry, it was in 
 a low condition, exhausted, washed into gullies and 
 unclothed with verdure ; and partly overgrown with 
 poverty grass, briers, and alder bushes. Writing to 
 Judge Peters in 1790, P. Price said — "In the spring 
 of the year 1792, I fenced off a piece of about four 
 acres (to fold his cattle), being a part of a large field 
 that was much reduced, washed into deep gullies in 
 many parts, and which had been totally neglected for 
 many years. The appearance was so disagreeable 
 that I put no value on it when I purchased the place, 
 though the field contained fifty acres." Mem. Pha. 
 Ag. Soc'y, 2 vol. The highest efforts of agricultural 
 improvement in this neighborhood at the time of the 
 purchase were those of a few meadows under arti- 
 ficial irrigation. Philip Price was in communication 
 with Judge Peters, Dr. Mease, and others, who had 
 begun to take a lively interest in the advancement of 
 agriculture, and his acquaintance and observation 
 extended to the best practical farmers and farms in 
 the county. He commenced on his newly purchased 
 place a course of improvement in manuring, the sow- 
 ing of red clover and other gras5es, and in the rota- 
 tion of crops, that rapidly took eflfect, and rewarded 
 his skill and labor. Lime was obtained from the 
 "Valley," gypsum or plaster from tide water, and 
 freely administered; the stable manure was protected 
 by shelter, and applied without loss of strength be- 
 fore the autumnal seeding of wlieat. Judge Peters, 
 in publishing the communications of Philip Price and 
 others, on the advantages of plaster of paris, says, — 
 "I have heard of none who have been more remarka- 
 bly successful in the plaster system than Mr. West 
 and Mr. Price. They have brought old worn-out 
 lands to an astonishing degree of fertility and profit, 
 by combining the plaster with other manures." —

Rotation of Crops. 
 The best rotation of crops, that resulted from expe- 
 rience, was to break up the sod late in the fall, or 
 early in the spring, and to plant the field with Indian 
 corn, pumpkins, and potatoes — the former intermixed, 
 the latter manured; the second year to sow with bar- 
 ley or oats, and after the removal of this crop, to 
 plough the stubble, manure and sow with wheat in 
 the fall, upon which was sown the clover and timothy 
 seed, to come into use for pasture after the wheat 
 harvest of the next summer, and to be mowed and 
 pastured with the use of gypsum for several succes- 
 sive years, until the field came in rotation for a like 
 repetition of crops. This process of careful husband- 
 ry transformed the exhausted hills of the Brandywine
