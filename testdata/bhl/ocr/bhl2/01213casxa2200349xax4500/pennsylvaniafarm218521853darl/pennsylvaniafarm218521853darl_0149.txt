into their present fertile and beautiful appearance, 
 and made them a garden spot of the world. And the 
 worthless, old Tvorn-out "fifty acre field," its proprie- 
 tor lived to see worth more than a hundred dollars 
 an acre, in common with the residue of the plantation. 
 To have been a pioneer in a process so beneficent and 
 of apparently magical results, would be felt as no 
 small honor to those who respire their happiness in 
 the popular favor and applause. To Philip Price it 
 was simply a source of benevolent satisfaction, in 
 contemplating the good he had aided in accomplish- 
 ing, of which his eye took a wide survey, from the 
 the porch of his mansion; but the obligation was not 
 forgotten by his neighbors, in after years, when the 
 members of the Chester County Agricultural Society 
 elected him its first President. 

Gypsum. 
 The results of the experiments of P. Price in the 
 use of plaster, as communicated in 1796, in answer 
 to the queries of Judge Peters, were, that on a high 
 loamy soil it operated better than on low-lying clay 
 ground ; one to one-and-a-half bushels per acre are 
 sufficient, repeated yearly while in clover; the effect 
 is good with or without recent ploughing ; is without 
 liability to leave the soil exhausted, as from the effect 
 of a stimulus, where the product is returned in ma- 
 nure; that it is most beneficially applied to Indian 
 corn and red clover, — but usefully to other grasses 
 and grain crops ; and may be used advantageously 
 with or without other manuring, and with the most 
 striking effect, if not immediately preceded by other 
 manure. The best time to strew it is at the first har- 
 rowing of Indian corn, and on clover, with a small 
 quantity soon after it comes up, to be repeated as 
 soon as vegetation takes place in the spring; this 
 giving a stimulus when most needed. The effect is 
 most visible on poor soil, — eight acres sowed plenti- 
 fully with it without other manure, in five years be- 
 come, says P. Price, "worth ten times what it was 
 before I plastered it, the face of the soil appearing to 
 be entirely changed, and is admired by all who have 
 hitherto known it;" but though now (1852) in a high 
 state of cultivation, the same article is annually used 
 with decided advantage, on the same farm. 

Dignity of Labour. 
 A Pennsylvania farmer and his son cultivating their 
 ownjields. 
 The recollections of tlie writer, though then young, 
 extend back to this period, (1807). lie was then and 
 for some years after, in conformity with the practice 
 of making all the children actively useful, assisting 
 in the business of the f;irm. Though frequently ta- 
 ken from home by the calls of the Society of Friends, 
 meeting the School Committee, &c., yet upon all urgent 
 occasions, and in matters requiring skill and judg- 
 ment, Philip Price was an important workman on his 
 plantation. With his own hand he sowed the grain, 

the grass seeds, and plaster, — struck the furrow for 
 planting and drilling; ploughed and harrowed the 
 corn; pitched the hay and grain sheaves at harvest, 
 with an elasticity of muscle and endurance of fatigue 
 that few could equal. He was a practical farmer of 
 efiicient energy, and sound judgment, skilled in the 
 choice and management of stock ; and an experienced 
 grazier lately told the writer that he had received 
 from him his first and best lessons in the selection of 
 cattle. He had a capacity to make riches, but he 
 preferred to educate his numerous family; to fulfil 
 the higher duties he believed he owed to his Creator; 
 and to keep the tempting cares and ambition of the 
 world beneath his feet. 

Merino Sheep. 
 Anecdote of the war of 1812. 

During the second war with England, from 1812 
 to 1815, when foreign supplies were cut off, our own 
 manufacturers having a monopoly of the home mar- 
 ket. Merino sheep came into great request, and at- 
 tained highly speculative prices. Large flocks then 
 and afterwards ranged the farms of Philip Price, 
 and were good fertilizers of the soil. But with the 
 influx brought by the return of peace, of foreign 
 goods, and the impolitic abandonment by the govern- 
 ment of an adequate protection to the capital invest- 
 ed in manufactories, wool and sheep found a sudden 
 depression, and the loss on t'lese aggravated the diffi- 
 culties of the farming interests, otherwise severely 
 suffering under the fall of prices incident to a return 
 after the war from an inflated paper currency to a 
 specie basis. The large flocks that whitened the hills 
 of Chester county soon disappeared, only to reappear, 
 many years afterwards, on the cheaper lands of the 
 rolling surface of Washington and adjoining counties 
 in Western Pennsylvania. An incident occurred in 
 relation to the produce of the sheep of P. Price, that 
 afforded some amusement at the time. Until then 
 blue had been the standing military colour, and he 
 had his wool manufactured into gray cloth and sent 
 to the store at West Chester thinking it quite secure 
 from military service; but it so happened that the 
 first volunteer company there formed fancied that 
 colour, called themselves the "Chester County Grays," 
 and the writer then a lad in the store, thoughthimself 
 in good luck to sell the whole stock of Quaker cloth 
 to the members to go to camp. The companies at 
 Marcus Hook were not, however, called to meet the 
 enemy, and the clothing had only served to keep the 
 soldiers warm, a circumstance hardly to be regretted 
 since among them were personal friends, and an un- 
 cle of the writer, Joseph II. Brintou, who, thougli of 
 great wealth, advanced age, and mild manners, be- 
 lieved it to be his duty to turn out as a volunteer 
 private in the defence of his country. lie was not 
 bred a Friend, and was undoubtedly actuated by a 
 high sense of patriotic feeling.
