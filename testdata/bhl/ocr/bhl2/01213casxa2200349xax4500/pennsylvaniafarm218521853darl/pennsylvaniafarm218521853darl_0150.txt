First Agricultural Society among our Farmers in 
 THIS State. 

The Agricultural Society of Chester county was 
 organized early in the year 1820, by the election of 
 Philip Price as President, Dr. William Darlington as 
 Vice President, and Isaac Sharpless as Secretary ; 
 and about fifty of its most substantial and worthy 
 farmers were appointed on its ten committees. It 
 was the first society in the State composed chiefly of 
 practical farmers. The objects en braced by its 
 standing committees, evince the intelligence and lib- 
 eral scope of the minds of the members. They 
 were: 1. On farm buildings, fences, and implements 
 of husbandry; 2. On the veterinary art; 3. On natu- 
 ral history, pa,rticularly mineralogy and entomology; 
 4. Political economy ; 5. Domestic animals ; 6. Grass- 
 es, grains and roots ; 7. Manures ; 8. Fruit and for- 
 est trees; 9. Irrigation and draining; 10. Horticul 
 ture; with specifications of the objects and purposes 
 of each committee. An address to the citizens of the 
 county was prepared bj Nathan N. Sharpless, recom- 
 mending its objects, and inviting investigation and 
 contribution of the results of experiment and experi- 
 ence; which states that "it is within the memory of 
 many of us that this county was very poor, but thanks 
 to the worthy founders of our present farming sys- 
 tem, our own industry and a beneficent Providence, 
 it has arisen to a degree of prosperity and excellence 
 seldom witnessed in so short a period of time. Most 
 of you know how this has been accomplished. It has 
 been effected by a judicious rotation of crops, by clo- 
 ver and gypsum." To encourage the diffident and 
 unpractised vrith the pen, the address proceeds — "It 
 would not be expected that all communications, to be 
 beneficial, should be grammatically correct, or in 
 smoothly rounded periods ; practical observations and 
 facts, tending in any degree tO' illustraite the subject, 
 will find as ready acceptance dressed in the plainest 
 language of simplicity, as the more polished sentences 
 of the philosopher or scholar." 

A further address, from the pen of another mem- 
 ber, William H. Dillingham, will also be found in 
 the columns of the " Village Record," of the same 
 year, enfoi'cing concert of action for the common 
 interest, the diffusion of useful intelligence, and to 
 raise the profession of agriculture in the public esti- 
 mation. Much of this address would have been for- 
 cibly pertinent in favor of the formation of a State 
 Agricultural Society, as lately consummated, at a 
 central point for exhibition, the receipt and diffusion 
 of information, seeds, &c. And reference is made to 
 another greut branch of human industry to enforce 
 the argument and afford encouragement to a like 
 vigilance and concentration of power. " In no part 
 of the world are the merchants without their Cham- 
 ber of Commerce, and to this means, in a great meas- 
 ure, is to be ascribed, not only their high rcspectabil" 

ity as a body, but their great unanimity in public 
 measures, and their weight in almost every govern- 
 ment. The moment their interests are touched in 
 any one point, the whole body sympathizes, and all 
 their influence is exerted through the common organ." 
 Chester county has now her Horticultural Hall, and 
 though a later architectural ornament to West Ches- 
 ter than the Chester County Cabinet, the purposes of 
 the Agricultural Society probably suggested the 
 formation of the Cabinet, Horticultural Society, &c. 
 Certain, however, it is, that such naturalists as Dr. 
 Darlington, David Townsend, Joshua Hoopes, and 
 many others, were active in all, and by their indus- 
 try and zeal, have added to the scientific character 
 of the country, and one of them by h's publications 
 has acquired a reputation among European savans. — 
 In giving his learning, and the remains of other nat- 
 uralists — of Baldwin, Marshall, CoUinson and Bart- 
 ram — to the public, he has in the benevolent spirit, 
 and notin thatof those whom Buckminster reproaches 
 as the misers of learning, who hoard for themselves 
 alone : " That learning, whatever it be, which lives 
 and dies with the possessor, is more worthless than 
 his wealth, which descends to posterity." If all ca- 
 pable of teaching would thus earnestly devote them- 
 selves in some way and to some extent, to instruct 
 mankind, the progress of improvement would be vast- 
 ly accelerated. 

This address was prepared by him as one of the 
 Committee associated with Dr. Darlington and Nathan 
 11. Sharpless. 

Sheep Shearing and Sacking Wool. — This should 
 not be done sooner than the season will admit, as the 
 sheep would be in danger of taking cold. Wool in- 
 tended to be sent to a distant market, may be put up 
 and pressed in bales after the manner of cotton, or it 
 may be crowded into sacks holding from 200 to 250 
 pounds. If designed to be shipped on a long voyage, 
 it would be more economical to press it into square 
 bales, as it would then occupy less bulk and conse- 
 quently effect a saving of freight. But if the interi- 
 or of the country where the conveniences for baling 
 are not always at hand, sacks may be employed made 
 of 40 inch "ourlaps," or 45 "gunny cloth," 7 and a 
 half feet long. Each of the sacks may be made of a 
 piece of cloth five yards in length, by doubling tlie 
 ends until they meet, and sewing up the sides with 
 twine. 

The mouth of a sack may next be sewed to a strong 
 hoop of wood or iron [diameter 25 inchesfor the our- 
 laps and 28 inches for the gunny cloth,] then let 
 down its body through a circular hole, 2 inches less 
 in diameter than the hoop, cut in an upper floor of 
 the building, or of a temporary scaffold erected for 
 the purpose, where it can be let swing clear beneath. 
 One man may then get into the sack, while another 
 hands him the fleeces, which he should place in reg- 
 ular layers, pressing them down in the mean time, 
 with his feet until it is filled. After this the sack 
 may be slightly raised, the hoop disengaged, the 
 mouth of the sack sewed up, and the operation is 
 complete.
