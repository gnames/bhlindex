their milking qualltif>8 have been verymuch impaired. 
 " As boasts uf draught, their general form renders 
 them unfit : yet many of them are sufficiently power- 
 ful, and they are more active than some other breeds 
 used for the plough, or on the road ; but the horns 
 generally form an insuperable objection, to this use 
 of them." — Youatt & Martin on Cattle. 

The Merino. 

The Merino, thoug-h a native of a warm climate, 
 becomes readily inured to the greatest extremes of 
 cold, flourishing- as far north as Sweden, without de- 
 generating in fleece or form. It is a patient, docile 
 animal, bearing much confinement without injury to 
 health, and possesses none of that peculiar "vora- 
 ciousness of appetite," ascribed to it by English wri- 
 ters. Accurately conducted experiments have shown 
 that it consumes a little over "two pounds of hay per 
 diem, in winter ; the Leicester consumes from three 
 and a half to four ; and the common wooled Ameri- 
 can sheep would not probably fall short of three. — 
 The mutton of the Merino, in spite of the prejudice 

which exists on the subject, is short grained and of 
 good flavor, when killed at a proper age," and weighs 
 from ten to fourteen pounds to the quarter. " It is 
 remarkable for its longevity, retaining its teeth and 
 continuing to breed two or three years longer than 
 the common sheep," and at least half a dozen longer 
 than the improved British breeds ; " but it should be 
 remarked in connection with this fact, that it is cor- 
 respondingly slow in arriving at maturity. It does 
 not attain its full growth before three years old, and 
 the ewes in the best managed flocks, are rarely per- 
 mitted to breed before they reach that age." 

The Merino is a far better breeder than any other 
 fine-wooled sheep, and experience goes to show that 
 its lambs, when newly dropped, are hardier than the 
 Bakewell, and equally so with the high bred South- 
 Down. The ewe is not so good a nurse, however, 
 as the latter, and will not usually do full justice to 
 more than one lamb. Eighty or ninety per cent, is 
 about the ordinary number of lambs usually reared, 
 though it often reaches one hundred per cent, in care, 
 fully managed or small flocks. — RandalVs S. Hus

The use of the siphon for watering plants. 

The following simple plan for protecting cucum- 
 bers from the effect of severe drought, has been suc- 
 cessfully tried by a gentleman of Lancaster City : 

A small vessel of wood or earthenware (he used 
 paint kegs) was placed near the Cucumber hills. A 
 piece of rope, (first thoroughly saturated with water) 
 was then laid from the vessel to the root of the vines. 
 This rope acting upon the principle of the siphon, dis- 
 charged the water from the vessel directly to the 
 roots of the vines, thus maintaining a sufficient de- 
 gree of moisture to keep them in a flourishing con- 
 dition, when all the vegetation around was parched 
 with drought. Those who feel desirous of trying the 
 experiment will bear in mind the fact that the short- 

est part of the rope must be immersed in the water, 
 otherwise it will not operate. Although the use of 
 the siphon is well known, we have never known it 
 applied to the watering of plants before. 

Ardent in the commencement, careless towards 
 the conclusion. This is a fault common to many in 
 the conduct of their affairs, and one which alwa3'8 
 ought to be guarded against; for, without persever- 
 ance and steadiness, few projects can be brought to 
 perfection, and without these essential qualifications, 
 no difficulties are ever surmounted, no consummation 
 is ever attained; and how many once flourishing 

concerns do we see crumble away? how many once 
 thriving establishments dilapidated, through this de- 
 fect in the conductors?
