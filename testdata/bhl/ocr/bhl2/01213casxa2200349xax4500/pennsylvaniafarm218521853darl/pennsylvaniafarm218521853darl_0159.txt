Mr. Wilder, amidst much applause, took the chair^ 
 and addressed the Convention as follows: — 

Gentlemen of the Convention : — I will not interrupt 
 the proceedings of this body by any extended remarks 
 from the chair ; but I cannot forbear to tender to you 
 my heartfelt gratitude for the honor you have con- 
 ferred upon me in selecting me to preside over your 
 deliberations — an honor which is connected with a 
 pursuit which has ever laid near my heart. 

Permit me also to express my great gratification 
 that there are present so members representing the 
 agricultural interest of this great Republic — ^ome 
 gentlemen coming from difierent and distant parts of 
 the Union, at great personal sacrifice ; but whether 
 from the North or the South, the East or the West, 
 I extend to each of you the hand of fellowship, and I 
 greet you as brothers in a common cause. 

Gentlemen, we come here with no sinister motives ; 
 we have no political arguments to advance ; we have 
 no sectional or party purposes to promulgate, but we 
 are here for more important purposes. We are here 
 to advance an art coeval with the existence of the hu- 
 man race — an art which employs eighteen millions 
 of our population, any four-fifths of the capital in our 
 fair land — an art which lies at the very foundation 
 of national and individual prosperity and wealth, the 
 basis of commerce, of manufactures, and of industrial 
 pursuits. We are an agricultural people ; our habits, 
 our dispositions are rural. I rejoice that it is so, and 
 I pray that it ever may conlinuo to be so. Our coun- 
 try embraces every variety of soil, and is capable of 
 producing of the products of the torrid and temperate 
 zones ; and with a suitable application of science to 
 this art, and a wise division of labor, with proper 
 Governmental aid, there is no reason why American 
 agriculture may not sustain competition with that of 
 any other nation of the civilized globe. 

The progress of agriculture, as you all know, gen- 
 tlemen, has been slow in the United States, but a 
 new era has now commenced. The old worn out sys- 
 tems of cultivation, which have been followed by fa- 
 ther and son, and from generation to generation, are 
 now to be swept away, and science is now to take its 
 place in aid of honest industry. I rejoice, gentlemen, 
 that we live at this day ; I rejoice that the seed plant- 
 ed by the immortal Washington, and which has been 
 watered by thousands of other eminent agriculturists, 
 is now taking root, and that we live in our day to re- 
 alize some of the proud results of their hopes. 

Much of the progress which has been attained in 
 our country, is the result of individual enterprise, 
 aided by the agricultural press ; but the great motive 
 power is confederated action, is associated efibrt. — 
 Gentlemen, we have met on this occasion to avail our- 
 selves of this powerful impetus. At no period in the 
 history of our country has there been such an assem- 
 bly collected for the purpose of considering those ob- 
 jects for wiiich we are brought together, and there 
 has been no opportunity which is so favorable to the 
 interests of the farmer. 

Permit me again, gentlemen, to tender you my 
 thanks for the distinction you have conferred upon 
 me, and to say that in the course of our deliberations 
 I may, with your permission, participate in your de- 
 bates. 

On motion of Mr. Lee, it was resolved, " That it is 
 expedient to form a National Agricultural Society." 

Mr. Jessup, of Pennsylvania, apprehended that 
 there would be very little difi'erence of opinion upon 
 this question. Many gentlemen had come here, as* 
 far as he had been able to learn, not only desirous 
 that a national organization should be efiected, but 
 with the expectation that other things not immediate- 
 ly connected with its organization should also be act- 
 ed upon. For his part, he could see no difl5culty in 
 accomplishing an organization, and also efiecting all 
 other things that might be deemed desirable. If a 
 national organization of this character should inter- 
 pose between the people and national action on this 
 subject, he himself would be opposed to it, because he 
 did believe the time had come when the agricultural 
 interests of the nation had a right to demand an agri- 
 cultural department of this government, to protect, 
 sustain, and promote their interests. If the organi- 
 zation which was proposed could at all interfere with 
 the prosecution of this great object, he should have 
 great doubts as to its expediency ; but at the same 
 time, if this should not be accomplished at this ses- 
 sion of Congress, he believed a national organization 
 would be the medium of communication between the 
 farmers of the Union and the Congress of the nation, 
 which might eventuate in the accomplishment of 
 what the farmers of this Union, when they should 
 understand the bearing of the great question, would 
 demand with perfect unanimity. 

A committee of one from each State was then ap- 
 pointed, to prepare business for the Convention. 

And thereupon the Chairman announced the fol- 
 lowing gentlemen to constitute said committee : 

Messrs. Holcomb, of Delaware : Douglas, of Illi- 
 nois ; J. A. King, of New York ; Dawson, of Geor- 
 gia ; French, of Massachusetts ; Steele, of New Hamp- 
 shire ; Thurston, of Rhode Island ; Hubbard, of Con- 
 necticut ; Stevens, of Vermont ; Elwyn, of Pcnnsyl- 
 nia; Calvert, of Maryland; Campbell, of Ohio; 
 Hancock, of New Jersey ; Callan, of the District of 
 Columbia : G. W. P. Custis, of Virginia ; Burgwyn, 
 of North Carolina ; Taylor, of Alabama ; DeBow, of 
 Louisiana; Sperlcer, of Indiana; Mallory, of Ken- 
 tucky; Bell, of Tennessee; Weston, of Wisconsin; 
 McLane, of California ; Pickhard, of Maine; Seaman, 
 of Michigan, 

Sever il subjects were referred to this committee, 
 and among others, to prepare a memorial to be pre- 
 sented to Congress relative to an Agricultural Bu- 
 reau. 

During tho absence of this committee from the hall 
 of meeting, several gentlemen entertained and in- 
 structed the Convention by delivering interesting ad- 
 dresses on the condition of agriculture in their re- 
 spective States. 

Mr. Calhoun, of ^lassachusetts, announced the
