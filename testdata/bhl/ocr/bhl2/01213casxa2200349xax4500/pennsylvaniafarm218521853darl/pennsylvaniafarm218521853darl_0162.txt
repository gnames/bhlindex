Mr. Editor: — The above heading I have no doubt 
 will appear to many as being useless and only exper- 
 imental. But my intention is to give you a short 
 description of a case that came under my notice ; 
 and show to the numerous readers of your valuable 
 Journal that surgery may be as successfully practis-

 laughed at the idea and said he thought it was im- 
 possible, as that was a disease belonging to man and 
 not to brutes. I carefully examined the Cock and 
 found his crop very much distended and very hard — 
 and when I placed him on his feet he would repeat- 
 edly fall forward from the enormous weight of his 
 crop. Presuming that his stomach wanted relief, and 
 not knowing how an emetic would operate, I determ- 
 ined to perform an operation at all hazards. 

Having, as I thought, diagnosticated the case pro. 
 perly, I commenced by making an incision into the 
 crop with a scalpel and removing from therein almost 
 a quart of matter ; among which were many whol'^
