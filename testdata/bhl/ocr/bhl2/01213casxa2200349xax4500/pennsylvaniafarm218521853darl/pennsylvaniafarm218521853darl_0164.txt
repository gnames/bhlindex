found that the new vine (which necessarily must 
 bring the grapes) of the first, will not be so thriving 
 and healthy as those of the last. Admitting that in 
 blossoming they differ a little ; yet some will soon 
 fail, and fewer grapes in the bunches are sure indi- 
 cations that the old vine has failed to supply suffi- 
 cient vital force, to form a grape from every embryo. 
 I do not wish to say, that none fail in the vine of a 
 few years only ; inasmuch as failures will be found 
 there ; but careful attention will soon disclose the 
 fact, that he who constantly raises new vines from 
 the surface, will have thriving vines, splendid grapes 
 and few failures, whilst the product of the old vines 
 will be puny, and the failures frequent 

I shall be happy to have a corroboration or denial 
 of this, by those whose practical observations and 
 experiments are more extensive than my own.

Our correspondent will scarcely find his observa- 
 tions sustained by those of others who have written 
 upon the vine. Hoare in his " Practical Treatise on 
 the Grape Vine" differs with him entirely. From a 
 series of extensive and careful observations he pre- 
 sents the following as a " Scale of the greatest quan- 
 tity of grapes, which any vine can perfectly mature, 
 in proportion to the circumference of its stem, meas- 
 ured just above the ground : 

till its roots have multiplied sufficiently to provide a 
 fu'l supply of nourishment without suffering from ex- 
 haustation, the plant commences its fruit-bearing life 
 with a degree of vigor which lays a sui-e foundation 
 for its future prosperity. 

Will not some one of our correspondents favor us 

with their observations on this subject ? 

It will be seen, that if 2^J inches be deducted from 
 the circumference of the stem of any vine, the capa- 
 bility of it will be equal to the maturation of ten 
 pounds of grapes for every remaining inch. The pro- 
 portionate quantity for fractional parts of an inch 
 may be easily calculated." 

From this scale it will be seen that vines of the age 
 preferred by our correspondent are smaller in girth 
 than any admitted by Mr. Hoare to be capable of 
 bearing fruit, without positive injury to the vine it- 
 self. The grape vine rarely, unless under peculiarly 
 favorable circumstances, attains a greater circumfer- 
 ence than two inches in the third year, and here we 
 again quote from Mr. H.; 

No vine is taken cognizance of, until its stem mea- 
 sures three inches in girth, as, under that size, vines 
 ought never to be suffered to ripen any fruit. This is 
 a rale that should be strictly adhered to in the man- 
 agement of young vines, for it may safely be asserted 
 that for every pound weight of grapes extracted from a 
 vine before it has grown to that size, ten pounds will 
 be lost during the next five years, independently of the 
 very severe check which is given to its growth by 
 premature bearing. But by husbanding its strength, 

Plan for a Farm School. 

East Bradford, Chester co., July 22, 1852. 
 Mr. Editor : — I will ask leave through your peri- 
 odical, to call the attention of the farmers of this 
 State to what I conceive to be a practicable and econ. 
 omieal mode of founding an Agricultural School, 
 namely — by the subscription of individuals in the 
 form of stock. A farm of a sufficient number of 
 acres could be purchased, in a central and easily ac- 
 cessible part of Pennsylvania, for fifteen or twenty 
 thousand dollars. The house upon it, if not thought 
 to be large enough, could be added for five thousand 
 more, or probably much less. The barn and other 
 out-buildings, it is probable, would be both capacious 
 and numerous enough without any additional outlay 
 A capital of twenty-five thousand dollars seems to be 
 ample for this portion of the scheme. The next 
 point is as to the amount of money necessary to pay 
 the salary of a principal, who should be a good prac- 
 tical farmer, and two or more instructors in the usual 
 branches of an English education, and such depart- 
 ments of literature and science as it may be decided 
 should be taught. It is not easy to give a sum ne- 
 cessary for this purpose, as it is to be supposed the 
 school and the farm will do a good deal more than 
 pay the expenses, so as to render it unnecessary to 
 raise a sum much beyond the price of the farm, and 
 the unavoidable incidental expenses at the first. 

But if another twenty-five thousand dollars be 
 thought to be essential, the whole investment will 
 then be fifty thousand dollars, to be paid in small 
 sums by such liberal individuals as think the plan 
 will be useful, profitable and honorable to themselves 
 and their State. I do not offer a matured plan of an 
 agricultural institution, as it will be clear to every 
 one who reflects upon the matter, that this would re- 
 quire much thought, and much discussion ; but I 
 present a suggestion which I wish my fellow-citizens 
 to express their opinions upon. In all such shadow- 
 ings forth there are considerations full of hope, that 
 rise smilingly before the mind, and others full of 
 despair that press upon and alarm the imagination ; 
 but with an open and free imagination, all these as- 
 sume their proper position. 

In the present condition of our State finances, I 
 think it wrong to call upon the legislature, nor do I 
 believe it possible to establish a plain, inexpensive, 
 working institution, if the legislature of the State 
 should grant a charter for such a purpose as a State 
 Agricultural School. One of the first feelings that
