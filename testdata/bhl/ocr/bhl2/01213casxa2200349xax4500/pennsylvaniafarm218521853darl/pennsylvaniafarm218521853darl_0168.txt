only by communications authorized by government. 
 One authentic centre is desired, toward which all in- 
 formation may be directed, and from which it may be 
 diffused. 

The attention of Congress has been called to the 
 subject by recommendations from the Executive in 
 favor of a Bureau of Agriculture. A convention as- 
 sembled at the seat of government, in no respect 
 sectional in its character, has very recently di- 
 rected an appeal to Congress for " such aid to Ag- 
 riculture as in their wisdom they may seem fit." 

Your memorialists; representing the oldest agricul- 
 tural association in the country, beg leave to second 
 these appeals, and to express the hope that Congress 
 may interpose effectually in behalf of this great in- 
 terest. Already the habit is fixed of collecting and 
 diffusing information in theory and practice through 
 the Patent Office. This has been done through a 
 succession of Administrations. Among the subjects 
 discussed in the reports emanating from that office, 
 none have given deeper interest or wider circulation 
 to the numerous copies published under the auspices 
 of Congress than those which concern the cultivation 
 of the soil. 

Your memorialists, in asking that a specific shape 
 may be given to the encouragement bestowed by 
 the general government, merely propose that an 
 authority already exercised, may be made more 
 available — that it may take a course that will be, in 
 all respects, more systematic and satisfactory to the 
 country. 

Enactments by Congress for the benefit of agricul- 
 ture are familiarly known, and have been without 
 hesitation resorted to. Terms have been used in 
 them so general and absolute, that it would be late 
 in the day now to pause, merely because of a sup- 

Sosed doubt as to the authority for passing them. — 
 loney has been directly appropriated by Congress, 
 to be expended by the Commissioner of Patents in 
 *' the collection of Agricultural Statistics, and for 
 other agricultural purposes." 

Agriculture is the great employment of our peo- 
 ple. At an early period, Franklin pronounced it 
 to be the great business of our continent. The 
 first President commended it as such to the care 
 of Congress. Although it may not now be said 
 that for one artizan or merchant there are at least 
 an hundred farmers, as once was the Tact, yet it is 
 " a branch of industry which employs more than 
 half our populotion. and to a great extent, sustains 
 the other." 

Your Memorialists respectfully pray that a law 
 may be passed for the establishment of a separate 
 Burea, to be intrusted with the duty of promoting 
 the agricultural interests of the country.

been at work, and from almost every section of the 
 State, complaints of injuries from some cause reach us. 
 The oats crop, which is remarkably fine, has been 
 secured in good order. While the corn promises a 
 most observant yield. Potatoes look well, and im- 
 mense quantities have been planted, but we do no 
 think from present information that the yield will 
 be large. The dry weather of the past few weeks 
 has affected them very much. 

The Harvest and Crops. — The weather during har- 
 vest (in our vicinity at least) was all the farmers could 
 have desired. The wheat and rye, generally speaking, 
 was secured in fine condition. We are lead to fear 
 that the wheat crop of Pennsylvania will not be more 
 than half the usual yield. In some sections the wee- 
 vil has perpetrated its savages, in others the fly has 

Our Advertisers. — The attention of the reader is 
 directed to our advertising department where some- 
 thing will be found to interest all. Messrs. Wheeler, 
 Melick & Co., of Albany, offer their excelient Horse 
 Powers and other implements. Wheeler's Horse 
 Powers are manufactured and for sale also by Steever 
 & Co., of Harrisburg. 

Emory&Co.,of Albany, presenttheirlist of prices for 
 implements manufactured by them. For a full des- 
 cription of their Horse Power the reader is referred 
 to their circular which accompanied our last number. 

Messrs. Lee, Pierce & Lee, of Ercildoun, Chester 
 county, are in the field with Moore's Drill, of 
 the merits of which we have on several occasions 
 spoken, and again most cheerfully bear testimony in 
 its favor. 

Attention is also asked to Custei-'s Improved Drill, 
 for which the patentee claims superiority over all 
 others. It is adapted not only to the sowing of seed, 
 but also of guano, compost, &c. Mr. C. has added 
 some other improvements, for which he is now taking 
 measures to secure a patent. 

Shriver & McLean, Commission and Produce 
 Merchants, 34 S. Water, are good and reliable men^ 
 who, we have reason to know, will faithfully attend 
 to all business matters entrusted to them. 

Those in want of good Shanghai chickens will find 
 them at 314 Market st., where they are for sale by 
 I. S. Whitney. 

PennocFs Drill is also offered to the public with 
 valuable improvements. Although one of the first 
 drills of American invention, it has always maintain- 
 ed a deservedly high reputation and is certainly a 
 most excellent impliment. 

To Correspondents.— The length of the Premium 
 List of the State Society, which we were very desirous 
 of presenting to our readers, as well as the proceed- 
 ings of the National Convention, which we copy from 
 the Working Farmer, have crowded out a number of 
 excellent communications, which shall appear in our 
 next. 

Errors. — In consequence of our unavoidable ab- 
 sence from home at the time when our first form 
 went to press, a number of annoying typographical 
 errors crept into it, which we hope our readers will 
 overlook.
