The Paper Hanger's Companion, a practical Treatise 
 on Paper Hanging, in which the practical operations 
 of the Trade are Systematically laid down, &c. — 
 By James Arwivsmith. Philadelphia : H. C. Baird. 

This is a neat volume upon a subject generally too 
 little understood by those who pursue it as an occu- 
 pation in this country. The author, who writes from 
 a practical experience of fifty years, clearly explains 
 the requisites of each department of work, and en- 
 deavors to convince those who have paper hanging to 
 do, that it is an operation consisting in something 
 more than merely sticking paper on the walls, and 
 that it is true economy always to have it done in a 
 systematic and workmanlike manner. Every paper 
 hanger should have it. 

The Pennsylvania School Journal. — ^We welcome 
 to our table the July no. of the School Journal, a pu>b- 
 lication devoted to the interests of education, and 
 ably edited by Thomas H. Burrowes, whose zeal in 
 the cause he has undertaken is well known to the cit- 
 izens of Penna. Each number contains thirty-two 
 pages of well written and elegantly printed matter, 
 and the whole is furnished at $1 per annum. As the 
 Farm Journal is the only publication in Pennsylva- 
 nia devoted exclusively to Agriculture, so the School 
 Journal is the only one exclusively devoted to the cause 
 of Education. We are pleased to learn that Mr. B. 
 has already received most liberal encouragement, 
 which we trust will be largely increased. 

Graham & Godey for August, are both on our table, 
 presenting their usual neat and attractive appearance, 
 and both filled with choice contributions from our 
 ablest literary writers ; besides, numerous elegant 
 plates by our first artists. When both present so 
 many excellencies it is difficult to decide between 
 their merits. We therefore recommend both to the 
 attention of those who desire publications of such a 
 character. 

Haiper's Magazine for June and July is — not on 
 our table. Why, we cannot tell. Have you cut us, 
 friend Harper ? If so, we are sorry for it, for we 
 always esteemed your Journal a most pleasant one, 
 and one with which we generally spent the few hours 
 we could spare from our business. We borrowed 
 the two missing Nos., hoping they would eventually 
 reach us.

 this old favorite for July commences the thirty-fifth

 freshing. Price §3. Blackwood and any of the four 
 Reviews $5— or the whole of the four Reviews and 
 Blackwood $10. Leonard Scott & Co. publishers,

DRILLS! DRILLS ! ! DRILLS ! ! ! 

WE are now manufacturing the LARGEST and BEST AS- 
 SORTMENT OF SEED PLANTERS ever offered to the public ; 
 several varieties of which we have constantly on hand. Those in- 
 terested are respectfully invited to call, examine and satisfy them- 
 selves of their merits. 

We have so improved and simplified our Drill, as to enable us to 
 sell it at the following reduced rates : 
 One with seven tubes and wooden Seed Roller, quantity 

regulated by Screws, gSO 00 

For each additional Tube, 7 50 

Seven Tubed do , iron Seed Rollers, regulated with screws 85 00 
 Each additional Tube, 10 00 

Seven Tubed do,SingleHopper,and Patent Iron Seed Rollers, 
 which, by the movement of a single screw, is regulated 

to seed any desired quantity per acre, 85 00 

Each additional Tube, lo 00 

In addition to the foregoing, we are building a large number of 
 Slide Drills, which have been sctisfactorily tested, and are war- 
 ranted deeidedly superior to any other Slide Drills in the market, 
 particularly in the even distribution of the Grain upon rough and 
 and hilly ground; also in the facility and prision by which it is 
 regulated to sow any desired quantity per acre, as well as in the 
 lightness of draft, and gjeneral simplicily and durability. 
 For one of these Machines with seven Tubes, SCO 00 

'• each additional tube, 5 00 

The above Machines are Warranted not to Cut, Break, or AVaste 
 Grain ; to be made of the best materials, in a substantial and work- 
 manlike maneer, and to do the work more perfectly than any other. 

They are not liable to choke with white caps or straw, and are 
 suited to rough and hilly, as well as smooth and level land. 

Owing to the peculiar form of our depositing tubes, they run 
 easier and free themselves from filth better than any others. — 
 These Tubes are supplied with Reversible f^teel Points, either end 
 of which can be extended as they become worn. The simultane- 
 ous throwing into and out of operation of the Seed distributing and 
 depositing apparatus, (which we have patented) renders onr ma- 
 chine capable of being managed with much more ease and certain- 
 ty, particularly in seeding point and other irregular lands, than any 
 other Seed Planter. 

We also manufacture Horse-Powers and Threshers, Clover 
 HuUers, with and without Fans, Horse-Rakes, Corn-Shellers, ic 
 Also, Steam I<jigines and Mill Work, Screw Cutting done to order ; 
 Castings of every description, of the best quality, furnished at 
 Wilmington Prices. S. & M. PFJMNOCK,
