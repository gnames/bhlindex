CORNELL'S IMPROVED SELF- REGULATING 
 HORSE POWER, 

On the endless chain plan, for which letters patent 
 ■were obtained in February, 1852, is now offered to 
 the public with the assurances that it will be found 
 to possess advantages over all others now in use. It 
 will operate at a less grade, will give more poicer at 
 the SAME GRADE, and loith less labor to the horse than 
 any other. The comparatively small elevation at 
 which this power operates efficiently, relieves that 
 ruinous amount and kind of labor which other pow- 
 ers generally impose upon horses, and it is believed 
 that its advantages in this important respect alone, 
 if it possessed no other, must give it character, and 
 bring it into very general use. But this result is 
 further promoted by a most happy combination of 
 forces which gives to it an exceedingly light and easy 
 motion. The platform drums are large, and the ar- 
 rangement of the whole driving apparatus upon fric- 
 tion rollers reduces the friction of the machine to 
 such a slight amount that an almost inappreciable 
 fraction of the power exerted by the horse will put 
 the whole in motion. It is therefore peculiarly adap- 
 ted for driving light machinery, where an excess of 
 speed would endanger the machinery driven ; and yet 
 the solidity and strength of the power are such that 
 it is equally well adapted to the driving of the heavi- 
 est kinds of machinery. 

But it possesses other advantages — the Power is 
 under the control of a Governor or Self-Regulator. 
 As Horse Powers are generally consti-ucted, no effi- 
 cient means are provided for regulating the speed, or 
 guarding against accidents arising from undue 
 velocity. A portion of the machinery driven, or 
 of the Power itself, may be thrown out of gear, and 
 from this cause or some other, a greatly increased 
 velocity may be given to the remaining parts of the 
 machinery, and an increase of speed dangerous to 
 the limbs of the horse. All such difficulties are 
 entirely obviated by a Governor and Friction Brake, 
 which regulate aad control all undue velocity of the 
 Power. Cornell's Power thus constructed, regulated 
 and controlled, is singularly capable of the highest 
 execution which such machinery can attain, and 
 with safety. It is adapted to one or more horses, as 
 may be desired. 

Although but very recently produced, a large 
 number of the Powers have been sold in a community 
 in which those of Wheeler, Emery & Co,, and others 
 have been in use. 

. First Premium at Philaddphia County Exhibition. 
 _ At the Exhibition of the Philadelphia County Ag- 
 ricultural Society, held at the Rising Sun, October, 
 1851, the highest premium was awarded to Cornell's 
 Power, although in competition with that of Emery 
 & Co., and others. 

The power exhibited above was new, and made 
 without reference to such public exhibition, but, al- 
 though subjected to the close examination of the 
 very competent gentlemen who composed the official 
 members of those associations, the result has been of 
 the most flattering kind. 

First Premium at Bucks County Exhibition. 

Cornell's Horse Power was exhibited at the Bucks 
 County Exhibition held at Newtown, October, 1851, 
 and obtained the highest premium, although in com- 
 petition with Wheeler's and others. 

Additional information can be obtained by letter 
 as above directed, and the Power is always open to 
 inspection at the Depot, No. 15G Vine street, below 
 Fifth, Philadelphia. The Patentee is open to nego- 
 tiation for the sale of Township, County or State

 AGENT for Birkinbines Patent Improved Hydr.iulic Ram, 
 Force Pumps, Street Stops, Fire Plugs, and Hydraulic Machinery 
 HI general. 

The superiority of these Rams over all others is the great 
 amount oi water thrown to that wasted, the large size they can be 
 constructed, the durability of them, as well as the small amount 
 of attention and repairs they require— many running at present fir 
 4 and .5 years, without any repair. At the present time there are 
 n the United States, Cuba, Mexico and South America, about 
 2U00 in successful operation. 

The town of Naples in the 5tate of New York is supplied with 
 water by one of these Rams, throwing 20,000 gallons a Oay. .Many 
 more could be mentirned if space would permit. 

Persons wishing Rams sent to them by measuring the amount of 
 water their brook or spring affords, per minute, the head and fall 
 they can procure, the elevation to be overcome, and distance to be 
 conveyed, can have the proper Ram and Pipe sent them, with di- 
 rections for putting up. 

The expense, in most cases. is smaller than a well and pump. — 
 Letters post-paid, will meet with prompt attention. When desired 
 an experienced person will be sent to put them at a small addition 
 al expense. Lead and Iron Pipe for sale. These Rams are war' 
 ranted in every respect. (Jan. 1852."
