After stating the case fairly to her, she quietly re- 
 marked, " AVell, that the farm you think of renting 
 is out of order, may not be denied. The house is not 
 a very comfortable one, but with a little of your as- 
 sistance I will engage to render it habitable at least. 
 A little economy and good management will enable 
 me to supply our own table with vegetables, and sell 
 enough beside to provide such matters as we may 
 need to render our situation more pleasant. If you 
 will manage the farm, I'll take care of the house, 
 ann if you will give heed to one of my father's fa. 
 vorite sayings, ^^ plow deep," I think we shall be able 
 to make both ends meet." " Enough said," was my 
 only reply. The farm was rented — and as much stock 
 and as many implements purchased as our little cap- 
 ital would allow. With hopeful hearts, my confident 
 little wife and myself, took possession of the old 
 farm. 

From a small manure heap (left by the former 
 tenant) we gave the garden a good dressing, and af- 
 terwards a thorough plowing, my wife occasionally 
 admonishing me to "plow deep." She then took pos- 
 session of it (my remonstrances to the contrary not 
 withstanding) and very soon it gave satisfactory ev- 
 idence of her skill and tastes. 

But now came the " tug of war." Field plow- 
 ing was to be done for oats, corn and potatoes ; but 
 where was the manure to come from. Our little stock 
 of money was barely sufficient to purchase the actu- 
 al necessaries of life for ourselves and stock, until the 
 garden and fields would produce their crops ; so that 
 not a dollar was lef" for the purchase of manure. I 
 had not thought of this before, and for a moment I 
 regretted the step we had taken. With a heavy heart 
 I mentioned my new troubles to my wife, who with 
 a cheerful tone remarked, " Ploio deep," this year, 
 George, and let us see the result." Keassured by her 
 confident manner, I geared my horses — three fine, 
 stout fellows — and commenced plowing. The ground 
 was in fine condition, and remembering Mrs. L.'s ad- 
 monition, I set my coulter deep. Away we went, and 
 after a furrow or two, I stopped to examine the soil I 
 had turned up. Much to my surprise, and I assure 
 you, sincere pleasure, I observed that it difiercd ma- 
 terially in appearance, from that turned up by the 
 former tenant. There was a mystery about this, that 
 puzzled me for a moment ; but recollecting that I 
 plowed some four' or five inches deeper than my pre- 
 decessor had done, I began to see the wisdom of my 
 wife's advice, to "plow deep." I had found a manure 
 heap. My little knowledge of soils, (for I had been 
 an attentive reader of the only Agricultural Journal 
 I then knew of, the Albany Cultivator,) satisfied me 
 of this fact. Every round I made, my heart grew 
 lighter, until, when at noon, I returned hom?, I felt 
 as well satisfied that I should have good crops, as any 
 of my neighbors who had applied their hundreds of 
 ^oads of manure. 

The oats were sown, and the corn and potatoes 
 planted. My neighbors looked on and smiled at my 
 verdancy, In hoping to realize anything from that 
 soil without manure, and I verily believe I too should 
 have doubted, but for the hopeful spirit of my wife. 
 She was always cheerful and happy. Busy as a bee 
 the livelong day, the house hourly grew more com- 
 fortable and snug. The cows yielded a good supply 
 of milk, which her ready hand turned to first-rate 
 butter and cheese. The garden yielded most excel- 
 lent vegetables, which with the butter and cheese 
 were readily disposed for cash at our county town- 
 The chickens too acknowledged her fostering care, 
 and in fact every thing she turned her hand to ap- 
 peared to prosper. 

With an anxious heart, however, I looked forward 
 to the time when I should be able to judge of the cha- 
 racter of my growing field crops. The season was 
 good, and I soon had the pleasure of seeing them as 
 flourishing as any of my neighbors, and when har- 
 vested, they proved to be equally good. But this 
 could not last long. 1 had strong faith in the virtues 
 of deep plowing now ; but common sense taught me 
 that the time must come when, without some kind of 
 manure, I should be worse off than ever. My ma- 
 nure heap was increasing, but not rapidly enough to 
 furnish the supply necessary. My wheat ground re- 
 quired it all and more than all ; and I knew that 
 every fork full I could make during the winter would 
 be insufficient for my corn ground in the spring. — 
 At this juncture, my agricultural paper came in as 
 an adviser. I had read with much care and interest 
 an article on Clover, as a fertilizer, when turned un- 
 der in its green state, and at once resolved to try it, 
 as I had done the deep plowing. Clover seed was 
 purchased, and sown among the wheat late in Feb- 
 ruary, and as soon after harvost as I found it to be 
 in what I considered its rankest stage of growth, I 
 turned it under, keeping in mind my wife's motto, 
 l^low deep. I again put it in wheat, and the follow- 
 ing season I harvested a fine crop. I do not now re- 
 member the average yield, but know that it was near- 
 ly thirty bushels to the acre. Thus far things looked 
 so encouraging that I began to think of purchasing 
 the farm, and did so the ensuing fall, at a very low 
 rate. As the extent of my farming operations en- 
 larged, so did the number of my stock, and as a con- 
 sequence, the manure heap grew also. But this lat- 
 ter fact, did not deter me from pursuing the plan I 
 had originally adopted of plowing deep and turning 
 in green clover. 

In concluding this hasty sketch, I would remark 
 that it was prepared not with any desire on my part 
 either to extol the merits of my better half, or claim 
 originality for the method pursued; but simply to 
 show that it is not so difiBcult a method, to restore 
 what is generally termed ivorn out lands, as many 
 suppose. By deep plowing and green manuring, I
