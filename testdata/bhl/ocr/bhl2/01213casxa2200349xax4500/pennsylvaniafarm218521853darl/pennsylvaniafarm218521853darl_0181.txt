wholly destitute of it. The native strawberry pes- 1 
 sesses that delightful flavor which commends it to 
 the palate of almost everyone, while Hovey's seedling 
 is a large insipid fruit, beautiful it is true ; but valua- 
 ble only on account of its size and beauty. 

I am perfectly satisfied of one thing, which is this : 
 that modern horticulture is competent to produce 
 fruits of increased size ; but this enlargement is pro- 
 duced at the expense of the flavor of the fruit and 
 the life of the tree. Now, whether the purchase is 
 is too dear, is a question. I do not protend to speak 
 for others ; but for myself I say, give me the medium 
 sized, well flavored fruit, and let those who prefer it 
 take the large but more insipid. 

I presume, Mr. Editor, that you sometimes get hold 
 of the large green apples brought from the north 
 during the winter season, and sold at enormous prices 
 to our people. I do no not know the name ; but I 
 do know that more tasteless apples I have never met 
 •with. Yet their size secures their sale, and the same 
 may be said of nearly all the excessively large 
 fruits. 

If then, in conclusion, modern horticulture is able 
 to produce fruits only at the expense of their flavor 
 — the longevity of the trees, and the certainty of the 
 crops, it may be asked of what benefit has all its dis- 
 coveries been ? The old fashioned fruit grower will 
 answer, none ! while the new fashioned ones will 
 claim for it everything. I shall, however, be pleased 
 to hear from any of the advocates of the modern sys- 
 tem who may think proper to sustain its claims.

In this age of horticultural progress, friend T. 
 you will scarely find many supporters of your doc- 
 trine. Admitting your position that budding and 
 grafting have the efi'ect of shortening the lives of our 
 fruit trees, we think the following advantages enu- 
 merated by Downing will more than meet your ob- 
 jections : 

After having obtained a new and choice kind of 
 fruit, which in our hands is perhaps only a single 
 tree, and which, as we have already shown, seldom 
 produces the same from seed, the next inquiry is how 
 to continue this variety in existence, and how to in- 
 crease and extend it, so that other gardens and coun- 
 tries may possess it as well as ourselves. This leads 
 us to the subject of the propagation of fruit trees, or 
 the continuation of varieties by grafting and budding. 

The uses of grafting, and budding, as applied to 
 fruit trees, may be briefly stated as follows : 

1. The rapid increase or propagation of valuable 
 sorts of fruit not easily raised by seeds, or cuttings, 
 as in the case with nearly all varieties. 

2. To renew or alter the heads of trees, partially 
 or fully grown, producing in two or three years, by 
 heading-in and grafting, a new head, bearing the 
 finest fruit, on a formerly worthless tree. 

3. To render certain foreign and delicate sorts of 
 fruit more hardy by grafting them on robust stocks of 
 the same species native to the country, as the foreign 
 grape on the native. And to produce tine fruit in 

climates or situations not naturally favorable by 
 grafting on another s])ecies more hardy ; as in a 
 cool climate and damp strong soil, by working the 
 Peach on the Plum. 

4. To render (/«'«;;/" certain kinds of fruit, by graf- 
 ting them on suitable stocks of slower growth, as in 
 the case of the Pear on the Quince, the Apple on the 
 paradise stock, &c. 

5. By grafting several kinds on the same tree, to 
 be able to have a succession of fruit, from early to 
 late, in a small garden. 

G. To hasten the bearing of seedling varieties of 
 fruit, or of such as are a long time in producing 
 fruit, by grafting them on the branches of full grown 
 or mature bearing trees. Thus a seedling pear, 
 which would not produce fruit on its own root in a 
 dozen years, will generally begin to bear the third or 
 fourth year, if grafted on the extremity of the bear- 
 ing branches of a mature tree. 

The advantages of budding fruit trees, compared 
 with grafting, are so considerable, that in tliis coun- 
 try it is ton times as much practised. These are, 
 first, the great rapidity with which it is performed; 
 a skillful budder, with a clever boy following him to 
 tie the buds, being able to work from a thousand to 
 twelve hundi-ed young nursery stocks in a day. 2d. 
 The more convenient season at which it is performed, 
 in all countries where a short spring crowds garden 
 labors within a small space. 3d. Being able to per- 
 form the operation without injuring the stock in case 
 of failure, which is always more or less the case in 
 stocks headed down for grafting. 4th. The opportu- 
 nity which it affords, when performed in good season, 
 of repeating the trial on the same stock. To these 
 we may add that budding is universally preferred 
 here for all stone fruits, such as Peaches, Apricots, 
 and the like, as these require extra skill in grafting, 
 but are budded with great ease. 

Irrigation Avith the Siphon. 

Mr. Editor: — In a recentnumber of your Journal, 
 which I read with pleasure, when it comes in my way, 
 I found an article on a mode of irrigating plants, 
 which the writer claims as original. I take the lib- 
 erty of copying the following from the Port Folio, 
 vol. 4 for 1817, published in Philadelphia by >V". 
 Harrison Hall. The article is larger than necessary 
 to be copied by me, and perhaps you can refer to the 
 original article, which is accompanied by two wood 
 cuts.

" I selected two water melon vines near each other, 
 in soil of the same appearance, one of them being 
 considerably more flourishing than the othci*. I made 
 my experiment upon the declining vine ; by twisting 
 I'ently a cotton siphon made of candle wick, propor- 
 tioned to the stem of the plant : I then elevated a 
 pot of Avater above the surface of the ground, cover 
 ing it from the vehement heat of the sun with a piece 
 of plank. Having then wetted my cotton siphon in 
 order to communicate motion to the fluid upon the 
 fountain principle, I tied a small stone to one end 
 as a weight to sink it when immersed in the water ; 
 and dropping this into the pot, I passed the other 
 end down into the earth, by scratching the mould 
 gently away from the root, and giving the siphon a 
 spiral direction ruuud it, covered it slightly with the 
 replaced mould."
