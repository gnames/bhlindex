moistened, a few inches round the root of the plant, 
 in which condition it continued throughout the heat 
 of the day, without parching or scalding ; the siphon 
 supplied the demand of the plant, (and no more) a cool 
 succession took place through the effects of evapora- 
 tion ; and in a few days the vine became flourishing, 
 and outgrew its neighbors." 

I have rereatedly tried this experiment with good 
 effect, and think it capable of extension in a garden 
 or nursery by placing troughs the whole lengthjjof a 
 bed." 

[If our correspondent will carefully re-peruse'the 
 article in our last, which he asserts is claimed as 
 original, by the writer, he will find that no such 
 claim is advanced. We prepared the article 
 ourselves, from facts furnished by our friend 
 in Lancaster, and although an entirely new expe- 
 riment to him as well as ourselves, and conse- 
 quently original with liim, nothing more was claimed 
 for it than the simple fact that the experiment had 
 been tried, and was successful. We, however, thank 
 our correspondent for the attention to the subject, 
 and as he appears to be pretty well "booked up," 
 shall be pleased to hear from him more frequent-

Smut in Wheat. 

To know what an evil is, is the first and essential 
 step to accomplish its cure. Smut is the diseased 
 residum of a totally destroyed grain of wheat, bar- 
 ley, oats or corn : — and the disease may be commu- 
 nicated to any of these sound grains, by bringing the 
 smut in contact with them, and if it be already in 
 contact with them, the simple remedy Is to loash it 
 off. With regard to all other remedies which we 
 have tried, our conclusion is, that their merit consists 
 in how much loashing is to be done in their applica- 
 tion. The destroyed grain of wheat in its original 
 shape, the blasted head of barley or oats, and the 
 black fungus matter of corn are all smut, each of its 
 kind, and each will be effectually communicated by 
 i!ontact, to its kind. Let the experiment be tried by 
 rubbing the sound grain in smut, and it Avill be found 
 that it may be so effectually done, as to cause a pro- 
 duct of more than one half smut ; whilst a portion 
 of the same parcel of grain, thus prepared, in ay be 
 flo cleansed by washing, as to make a product entire- 
 ly free from the disease. We have no sympathy for 
 the farmer who complains of an injury to his crop 
 by smut ; — the fault is his own ; and much less for 
 him who complains of the trouble of preparing clean 
 seed. Fredk. Watts.

[While on the subject of smut, we present a fact 
 communicated to us a few days since, which may 
 prove interesting to some of our readers, and of which 
 we should like to have an explanation. On the farm 
 of Joel Lightner, sen., in Paradise twp., Lancaster 
 county, is a large cedar tree, which appears to exert a 
 singular influence upon the wheat grown in the field 

in which it stands. While, on a number of occasions, 
 the wheat in other parts of the field was much injur- 
 ed by smut, a strip, extending in a south-eastern di- 
 rection from the tree, through the whole field, and 
 just about the width of the tree was entirely free 
 from it. Will some of our correspondents explain 
 this singular effect ? Ed.] 

A REPtY. 

A reply to the argument advanced before ihe Union 
 Towiinship Agricultnral Club, on the transmu- 
 tation of Wheat into Cheat. 

Mr. President, I will not attempt to analyse the 
 different positions assumed by gentlemen on the oth- 
 er side of the question, or reply individually to the 
 deductions they have arrived at from carefully observ- 
 ing the freaks of this common weed. 1h.Q facts pre- 
 sented are no less varied and mysterious than are 
 daily presented, in almost every department of the 
 vegetable kingdom. 

The white clover appears under circumstances far 
 more mysterious and unexplainable than any other 
 plant on our farms. It is a native of Southern Eu- 
 rope, yet it is spoken of in Watson's Annuals " as 
 tinging the roadsides as a natural production" as ear- 
 ly as 1719. I have seen it spring up and cover the 
 ground the third year after the forest had been clear- 
 ed off, where not a seed of any kind had ever been 
 sowed by the hand of man. In the South, another 
 variety, called the yellow or hop clover, (Trifolium 
 procumbens) is almost as abundant as our white 
 clover, and appears quite as problematical. It first 
 made it appearance in South Carolina about 1800 ; 
 in a few years it will be here, as well as throughout 
 the AVest ! Another species of clover, and the car- 
 doon, both from Europe, cover the Pampas between 
 Buenos Ayres and the bars of the Cordilleras for the 
 distance of 180 miles — Encyclopedia of Geogrvphy, 
 vol. 1, page 248. What makes these facts more 
 mysterious, the seeds of clover are not particularly 
 constructed to maintain their vitality. 

Another plant that you are particularly familiar 
 with, is the bitter weed or rag weed, (Ambrosia arte- 
 misiaefolia) which is very common among the stub- 
 ble after a crop of wheat, and if the wheat is winter 
 killed it often takes entire possession of the soil ; the 
 next season, however, it generally disaappears. The 
 foxtail grass (Setaria glauca) is another plant of the 
 same nature. As soon as the soil is well set with 
 grass, these weeds disappear, and if a good sod covers 
 the ground and remains in that condition for 20 years 
 these weeds have not been observed, but immediately 
 after a crop of wheat they very frequently almost 
 cover the ground. 

The common mullein is another of these periodical 
 weeds. I have seen it spring up in old fields after they 
 had undergone a rotation of crops, but where the mul- 
 len had not been noticed for many years before. —
