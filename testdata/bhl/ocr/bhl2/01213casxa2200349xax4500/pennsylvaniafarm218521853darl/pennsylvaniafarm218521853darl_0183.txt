The second year after the "front ridges'^ of the 
 Bald Eagle have been farmed, this weed generally 
 makes its appearance in great profusion ; it here 
 seems to follow the thistle, (Cirsium lanceolatum) 
 this plant being abundant the first year. The 
 manner in which the thistle seeds get here is no diffi- 
 culty. This is the breeding place of the little yellow 
 bird or American goldfinch, and the seeds of thistle 
 are their favorite food. 

The pigeon weed is another plant that often makes 
 its appearance among the wheat where it was never 
 observed to grow before, and often on new land in its 
 first crop. I knew it to occur so abundantly on a 
 piece of new land in Nittany as to almost destroy 
 the wheat, and its appearance whenever certain 
 fields are sown with wheat is familiar to you all, and 
 its disappearance with the wheat is almost almost as 
 general. 

These plants are all foreigners, although consider- 
 ed by some, (not intimately acquainted with the his- 
 tory of plants,) as natives. 

Although the occurrence of these plants is an ob 
 ject of curiosty, they bear no comparison to our na- 
 tive plants. The fire weed (Senecio hieracifolias) 
 appears almost universally after a white pine forest 
 has been cut and burned. I have often seen it so 
 thick that it was no easy task to make way through 
 it. The seeds are perhaps carried into the forest a 
 long period before. The snow bird, chicadee, finch, and 
 crossbill build in these dense thickets, and line tlieir 
 nests with the soft pappus of the fire weed ; by this 
 means the seeds are carried into the forest. If these 
 burned woods are permitted to lie waste, a growth of 
 wild cherries (cerasus Pennsylvanica) comes next. 
 These seeds are planted by the above named birds,and 
 perhaps by others ; next comes huckleberries, moun- 
 tain tea, &c. These seeds are planted by the bird that 
 feeds on the cherry, and these seeds they drop. My 
 observation on these plants has removed the mystery 
 that once so formidably presented itself to me. 

-Still there seems to be a regular rotation. With 
 wheat we have cheat, pigeon weed and cockle ; 
 this is followed by rag weed and foxtail grass, and 
 this again by white clover and the grasses. When 
 a hemlock (Abies canadensis) forest decays, the 
 pitch pine take its place, and when this forest decays, 
 white pine takes its place, and this is the last of the 
 pines — oak, chesnut, and hickory follow. 

Dr. Dwight, in vol. 2 page 440 of his travels in 
 New England, says the lands which have been once 
 cultivated in Connecticut and again permitted to lie 
 waste for several years, yield a rich and fine growth 
 of hickory, although there may not bo a single tree 
 in any original forest within fifty miles. lie also 
 tells us of a field which had belonged to his grand- 
 father, containing about five acres which had been 
 cultivated at an early day, but abandoned, and a 
 growth of white pine sprang up, covering the field 

and retaining its figure exactly. The original forest 
 was oak and chesnut. I knew a similar fact in 
 Morris Township, Clearfield County, and another in 
 Clinton Co., on the property of David Matson, near 
 Washington Iron Works ; in both instances the origi- 
 nal forest was oak and chesnut. Facts similar to 
 these are every where abundant, and many of them 
 are of as difficult a nature as any cheat story we have 
 ever heard, whilst the knowledge of a mere circum- 
 stance often develops the whole secret. The Rev. 
 Dr. Robison, in his Natnral History of Westmoreland 
 and Cumberland, tells us of a grove of oak trees 
 which were known to have sprung from acorns that 
 had been planted by the crows 25 years before. The 
 Rev. Dr. Dwight in the work I have referred to, relates 
 a circumstance of turnip seed growing after laying in 
 the ground for 20 yea'-s. He also states that from the 
 dirt thrown from a ditch on the east coast of England, 
 there sprang up a great quantity of white mustard. 
 After many schemes to account for it, it was found 
 that the Dutch had cultivated mustard there 200 years 
 before. He also instances a case in which cherry trees 
 sprang up to all appearances spontaneously ; but upon 
 examination the seeds were found in the ground in 
 great numbers. 

The same author, vol. 2 p. 441, relates a case in 
 point. A farmer of Guilford; while reaping a field 
 of wheat found a quantity of cheat which was bound 
 into bundles to be used for fodder. It was thrown 
 together on a headland, but a wet spell prevented it 
 from being taken home, and it was permitted to rot 
 where it was thrown. Thirty years after this, this 
 headland, where this cheat was thrown, was grubbed 
 out and ploughed, and on the very spot a crop of 
 cheat sprang up. 

The farmers are familiar with the fact that in cer- 
 tain spots and certain fields,cheat is always the most 
 abundant. This has been traced to the original forest, 
 or a certain tree or cluster of trees, being the roost- 
 ing place of certain birds. The little quails or part- 
 ridges eat cheat, pigeons, turkeys, and almost all gran- 
 ivorous birds eat it also. Many persons suppose that 
 seeds taken into the stomach of birds will not grow, 
 but this is a mistake, " for many seeds when carried 
 to a distance from their native country have generally 
 refused to vegetate until they have passed through 
 the alimentary canal of birds" — Barton's Elements 
 Botany, page IGG. " The seeds of the mistletoe are 
 first swallowed by the thrush, and then deposited 
 upon the boughs of trees, it may happen to alight 
 upon. It is even said that the seeds of Magnolia 
 glauca refuse to germinate till they have undergone 
 a similar process" — Keith's Botanical Lexicon, p. 113. 
 Prof. Jacquin says, the birds, after having eaten the 
 seeds of the Loranthus, deposit the seeds on the most 
 lofty trees, whore they grow. Rumphius asserts that 
 the pigeon disseminates the tree Nutmeg in the East 
 India Islands. Wild pigeons have been killed near
