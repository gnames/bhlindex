New York with their crops full of rice, which was 
 collected in the plantations of Georgia. — Nuttall's 
 Ornithology, p. 762. The robins deposit the seeds of 
 the poke, elder, and many other nuisances along our 
 fence rows. Thus the best authorities from all quar- 
 tet's of the globe can be brought to sustain the fact 
 that the vitality of seeds is not destroyed by passing 
 through either birds or beasts. 

The doctrine of equivocal generation, or that the 
 earth contained the principles of vegetable life — spon- 
 taneous generation, or that plants spring up accident- 
 ly — and "transmutation" or that plants pass from one 
 to another from certain causes — have all had their 
 diy. But, if such thaories were really facts, there 
 would be no end to new combinations and no certain- 
 ty of finding to-morrow the species you have met with 
 to-day; but such is not the fact. We findspecies to be- 
 permanent and unchanging. There never has been 
 found a new plant springing up without the interven 
 tion of a seed or of a germ, and probably there never 
 will be, so long as an unchanging Providence rules 
 over the world; for even before man, every vegetable 
 germ was created ; and from that period every per- 
 fect seed contains an organized living body capable 
 of producing a plant of the same kind as that from 
 which the seed originated. 

It is true, there are a few hybrids ; but you can on- 
 ly produce hybrids on species of the same genus. No 
 one has ever succeeded in producing a hybrid of apple 
 and pear, or of gooseberry and currant; and it is only 
 the crossings of varieties of the same species that 
 can produce permanent hybrids in herbaceous plants. 
 All hybrids of different species, except in woody 
 plants, and these can be perpetuated by grafting, re- 
 turn again to the type of one of the parents in the 
 third or fourth generations. (See Kodreuter, Dc Can- 
 dolle, Lindlcy, Knigld, and Keith, on this subject.) 

Wheat and cheat are different species of the same 
 genus ; but species of different genus, so widely sepa- 
 rated, that no hybrid between then can ever be pro- 
 duced. Wheat belongs to the genus Triticum, of 
 which there are about 80 species — cheat to the genus 
 Bromus, of which there are 112 species. I made a 
 careful comparison of the two plants, which was pub- 
 lished in the 10th No., vol. 1st of the Farm Journal, 
 p, 310. Here you will discover differences that no 
 accidents or design can ever reconcile. But cheat is 
 a distinct plant, found growing in a wild state in the 
 south of Europe, and our cheat presents all the same 
 characters in detail with the native plant of Europe. 
 Now, would it be at all probable that any plant would 
 change by accidental causes, to exactly correspond 
 with another plant, and that a great variety of causes 
 should always produce this same degenerate plant, 
 the seeds of which will grow and produce in turn 
 seeds after its kind ? This latter fact, I believe, is 
 not questioned by any farmer who has any preten- 
 tions to the observation of facts. 

If we closely examine a seed of cheat we will find 
 that it contains a skin which consists of two mem- 
 branes much thicker than that on a grain of wheat, 
 on the inside of this is the farina, called in Botanical 
 language the albumen, from its analogy in situation 
 and office with the albumen or white of an egg which 
 surrounds the embryo chick. This is different in 
 character and quality from the farina in wheat, as every 
 farmer will testify who has tried it for feed ; indeed, 
 it is not worth feeding, being almost indigestible, and 
 when eaten whole, generally passes through the organs 
 unchanged. Situated near the base of the farina is 
 a little sac called the vitellus, and in this is the em- 
 bryo, in the cheat a mere speck,and in but few plants 
 so well guarded for maintaining its vitality. 

This embryo is the whole plant in miniature, or 
 the complete epitome of the plant. If we examine 
 a horse chestnut, or buckeye as it is sometimes call- 
 ed, we will find the embryo plant beautifully formed 
 in all its parts, and in the seeds of the Nymphcea 
 nelumbo, and in those of the tulip tree, the embryo 
 leaflets are so similar to those of the adult vegetable, 
 that LinnfBus, merely from an examination of these 
 leaflets, was enabled to determine to what vegetables 
 the seeds belonged. Amocritatus Academica, vol. 6, 
 Des. 120. 

When the seeds are so situated that they attain the 
 required amount of moisture, warmth, light, electric- 
 ity, and all the natural agencies necessary to operate 
 a chemical change, the seed germinates. At first a 
 part of the farina is dissolved and mixed with the 
 oily particles which exist in the seed, and this forms 
 a sort of mollifying juice, and this produces a slight 
 degree of fermentation, and this is the commence- 
 ment of germination. 

Almost every plant seems to require different de- 
 grees of some of their natural agencies, or perhaps 
 plants might be classed so as to explain the periodi- 
 cal appearance and the natural rotation of the growth 
 of plants on these grounds. 

A seed of wheat, if favorably situated, will vege- 
 tate in a single day, yet we are informed that wheat 
 taken from the hand of an Egyptian mummy, where 
 it must have lain 3000 years, germinated and grew, 
 and sprang up as if it had been the product of the 
 year preceding. Keith's Bot. Lex. p. 320. Wheat 
 sowed in the fall often lies until spring before it ger- 
 minates. A parsley seed requires forty days to ger- 
 minate, but it has been known to lie many years in 
 an old garden before it germinated. A walnut seed 
 lies in the ground a year, and a pappau'seed two 
 years. Many seeds will never vegetate if they are 
 permitted to get dry, as the horse chesnut, some of the 
 maples, &c., whilst others can be kept in the dry for 
 almost any length of time without destroying their 
 vitality, as wheat, corn, all the peas, sensitive plant, 
 &c., some of which have actually been kept from 60 
 to 100 years. Some plants will not germinate when
