The Practical Farmer. 

Mr. Editor : Your last Journal gave some inte- 
 resting- references to a good Chester County farmer, 
 who spent much of his life in the cultivation of the 
 mind and heart, while he also cultivated the soil. — 
 Kaving done what good he could in his day and gen- 
 eration, he went peacefully and quietly to his rest, 
 and it becomes those who follow him, to honor his 
 memory. 

It is fortunate that he left a son, fully competent to 
 the task, who has found himself able to turn aside from 
 super-abounding care in his profession, which public 
 confidence reposes in him,todischarge this sacred duty. 
 Farmers will thank him for presenting to them so fuly 
 the pattern of one of our early, successful, and intelli- 
 gent agriculturists. Philip Price was one of the 
 first decidedly improving Chester County farmers, 
 and no county in the State has gone ahead of Chester. 

The memoir from which you have furnished ex- 
 tracts, confirms traditions, which the writer has often 
 heard, that at the time of the revolution, and after, 
 the original productions of the soil about West Ches- 
 ter had been exhausted — that farms in the region 
 round, now cultivated like gardens and worth from 
 one hundred and fifty, to two hundred dollars per 
 acre, were little better than sand fields, scarce worth 
 cultivating — that Philip Price was among the first 
 to introduce improvements by the use of Lime and 
 Plaster, the rotation of crops, and the growing of 
 clover. From Osborn's Hill, one mile South of his 
 old homestead, the eye takes in an horizon of some 
 ten miles diameter, say from West Chester to Chad's 
 Ford, which presents more snug farms, improved 
 nearer as they should be, more agricultural thrift and 
 comfort, than, perhaps, any area of similar extent 
 in this country. Many of them are enclosed and di- 
 vided by living hedges. All have substantial, com- 
 fortable dwellings, large stone barns, neat stone 
 spring houses — and few are without water in every 
 field. Within this horizon, a few years back, there 
 was more than one cultivator who had his hundred 
 thousand at interest, the proceeds of tilling the soil 
 with his own hands aided by his sons, trained up in 
 the way in which they should go. On this spot, with 
 such well informed men as the late Judge Hopkinson 
 and Judge Baldwin at his right hand, the writer has 
 taken this survey, gone over their detail, and been con- 
 firmed by these close observers in the result above 
 above. It would be out of place to dwell on the his- 
 torical associations vvhich the spot calls up, it being 
 the position occupied by Lord Howe at the battle of 
 Brandywine ; Birmingham meeting house, where it 
 commenced being in full sight, and the hill north of 
 Philip Price's being the place at which the British 
 stopped to refresh, before the battle. 
 Among those who knew Philip Price long and in- 

timately, enjoyed his friendship and appreciated his 
 worth, was that popular Essayist, Charles Miner ; a 
 general favorite of farmers and of Friends ; who re- 
 presented that District in Congress two succeeding 
 terms with marked ability, and secured the abiding 
 confidence and correspondence of John Quincy 
 Adams and Henry Clay while they lived, as he had 
 before long enjoyed that of Thomas P. Cope and his 
 compeers whom he had met in our own Legislative 
 halls. Mr. Miner was one of the most active, intel- 
 ligent, and efficient promoters of the Agricultural 
 Society of which Philip Price was the first President, 
 and through the columns of the Village Record, did 
 much for the good cause. Some of the letters of Dr. 
 Mease which appeared there, might be republished 
 now, with profit. The first beautiful things of Bryant 
 the poet, we ever saw published in Pennsylvania, an 
 ode prepared for an agricultural rejoicing, which has 
 not since been surpassed, appeared in the Record in 
 1820. You have a copy of this ode. 

These few remarks are intended as introductory 
 to what Charles Miner said of the excellent man 
 (whose memorial by his son has recently appeared,) 
 when he died. ****** 

Extract of a letter from Charles Miner, Esq., to 
 Eli K. Price, Esq., dated March 4, 1837 : 

" In a long intercourse with the world, I have nev- 
 er met with a man who united in himself so many 
 claims to esteem and love. His aspect was so benig- 
 nant, his manner and address were so mild and en- 
 gaging, that the bosom seemed to open to him in 
 confidence before he spoke. Then, his clear mind, 
 sound understanding,and benevolent heart commanded 
 respect, inspired confidence, and enabled him to do 
 so much good among his fellow men. 

Extract of an article from the same source which 
 appeared in the Wyoming Herald, soon after. 

"Philip Price was descended from a very respec- 
 table Welsh family, among the earliest settlers in 
 Chester county. In person he was tall, well formed, 
 of excellent though not robust constitution. Hia 
 countenance mild, intelligent, and pleasing, his move- 
 ments dignified and easy, and his manners and address 
 remarkably bland and prepossessing. The mind of Mr. 
 Price was well informed, his judgment clear and 
 strong, united to an intuitive perception of character, 
 and a ready apprehension of the right and proper in 
 all matters of business. Though seeking no distinc- 
 tion in the walks of public life, it was impossible but 
 such a man should have extensive influence in soci- 
 ety. He had. And as duty led him, it was his pride 
 (if that word may be used in connexion with his 
 name) and pleasure to exert that influence for the 
 benefit of his fellow-men. 

" Mr. Price was among the earliest, most liberal, 
 and enlightened of those who broke in on the old ex- 
 hausting method of farming ; and took the lead in 
 introducing plaster, clover, lime, and a proper rota- 
 tion of crops, the four grand pillars of improvement 
 that have raised and sustain Chester county as one 
 of the most rich and productive districts in Pennsyl- 
 vania. No one had more influence in the excellent
