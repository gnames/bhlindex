A. J. Don'NiNG, Esq. — Dear Sir : On the score of 
 sound practice in agriculture, rather than of courtesy 
 to me, I claim the privilege of saying a word in re- 
 lation to the strictures in your last number, upon my 
 remarks on " Green Crops as a manure." I do not 
 complain that you took occasion to animadvert upon 
 anything you found worthy of noting in my Agricul- 
 tural Address, at Lancaster, being well aware that it 
 was perfectly at your option to single out for com- 
 ment, Avhatever you might deem objectionable. — 
 Acknowledging, also, that I have no right to expect 
 every one should concur in my views, upon a matter 
 as susceptible of a difference of opinion, as the con- 
 diti )n of farms and the position of farmers differ — 
 tlio circumstances being the rule by which to deter- 
 mine the necessity or propriety of turning in a crop 
 to serve as manure. 

In my address, in which the turning in of green 
 crops was merely incidental, it could not be expected 
 that the special cases, justifying a resort to such 
 manuring, could be enumerated — I could but deal 
 with the subject in a broad and general sense, and 
 from a long and close observation on the practice of 
 husbandry, a sense of duty constrained me to de- 
 nounce the custom of raising crops to be plowed un- 
 der, as " time wasting and land cheating." No one, 
 not even yourself, Mr. Editor, can have a higher ap- 
 preciation of vegetable mold than I have, and I chal- 
 lenge New York, or any farm in Pennsylvania, to 
 shovr better sods on uplands, after having yielded for 
 as many years, heavy crops of hay, than I can now 
 show upon my place ; and may safely add, that I have 
 yet to meet the man who would rejoice more in hav- 
 ing such a sod to turn under, when it becomes neces- 
 sary to break it up ; but with all this appreciation, I 
 would not rely upon it to bring me a crop of grain, 
 potatoes, &c., without the addition of what is known 
 among farmers as " barn-yard manure," notwith- 
 standing such a sod would be richer and more en- 
 during than the " scant crops of partly grown clover, 
 buckwheat," &c, which I pointed at as unworthy the 
 name of manure. Had these fields I have mown for 
 some seven or eight years, been laid down in 1833 
 and 4, with only clover or buckwheat, and the like, 
 turned in, would they, as they did, have yielded forty 
 to forty-five bushels of wheat to the acre, as first 
 crops, and cut ever since close on two tons of fine 
 hay, on an average, to the acre? 

Assuredly not. In the course of two or three 
 years at farthest, the crop of clover growing, would 
 l)e required to turn under, to serve as manure for a 
 grain or some other crop, involving prematurely the 
 labor of breaking up, seeding, tf'c; and what would 
 be the condition of the land, and the character of the 
 crops, after another two or three years shift under 
 such a practice — I allude to such soils as we culti- 
 vate? It was in view of this system that I said, "in 
 whatever place it is practiced, however strong the 
 land may be at the start, the system, if persevered 
 in. must inevitably bring the land, its owners, and 
 the country, into a state of poverty. No good hus- 
 bandman would think of pursuing such a course." 

If the address had been fairly read, its general 
 bearing and scope properly considered, it might, per- 
 haps, saved you and others from drawing the infer- 
 ence, that I held clover and other green crops worth- 
 less as fertilizers. I never so thought, nor did I in- 
 tend to be so understood. I knew clover would in 
 some degree serve the purpose of manure, and so 
 would potatoes, wheat, rye, barley, &c., &c., but I 

knew also that these, as clover, would be costly and 
 but indifferent manures, compared to barn yard ma- 
 nures, peat, and putrescent substances, which if not 
 used to enrich the land, would become pestilential 
 nuisances ; for we must have cattle and other live 
 stock — while offal and other offensive matter would 
 be constantly accumulating. Insisting, as I did, upon 
 the crops going to the barn, to be put to their proper 
 use, and the offensive matters applied, as they should 
 be, to the land ; and in this, who shall be so unthink- 
 ing as to say, I was wrong ? Moreover, I had been 
 grieved to perceive a germ of quackery springing up 
 with our efforts at scientific agriculture, and while I 
 attempted to awaken the good farmers of Lancaster 
 to a proper spirit of improvement, I took occasion, 
 husbandman like, to caution them against nostrums 
 and humbug, urging a chief reliance upon the cheap 
 and excellent manures so easily obtained in and 
 about their barn yard and premises. 

To the question whether I have seen the statement 
 of IMr. More, in regard to his premium farm — I an- 
 swer that I have ; and, instead of condemning his 
 practice, have simply to say, that had I been in his 
 situation, I might, perhaps, have resorted to the same 
 means, he had recourse to for the improvement of his 
 land. But did Mr. More depend solely upon the 
 turning in of green crops, pending the process of 
 renovating it ? I presume he used other manures, 
 which with gypsum, aided in restoring his farm to 
 good condition. But this case, and others I have 
 heard of, do not affect the force of the injunction 
 against a persevering system of turning in green 
 crops as a substitute for manure. It may be that this 
 very land that Mr. More found so wretchedly impov- 
 erished, when he took possession of it, owed much of 
 its poverty to his predecessor having followed more 
 closely the appliances of clover, buckwheat, &c., by 
 way of manure than Mr. More did — one thing at 
 least is certain, and that is, the impoverishment was 
 not owing to the former owner or tenant having been 
 too liberal in the application of barn yard manure. 

Now the best way to test the soundness of my 
 views, as to the system I so deprecated, would be, for 
 some one having a fiirm in such good condition as 
 Mr. More's is now found to be in, to follow the green 
 crops thoroughly for five years, discarding the vulgar 
 practice, if you please, of husbanding barn yard and 
 stable manure. To note the seasons consumed in 
 raising the crops to be turned under, to produce the 
 "carbon," "oxygen," "nitrogen," &c., — the simon 
 pure fertilizers required to grow the wheat, rye, corn, 
 potatoes, c%c., &c., for the barn — to keep an exact ac- 
 count of the value of the crops so housed, together 
 with the sum total of the expenses of the farm, and 
 then to exhibit the net gain in the " yellow boys " 
 that are now jingled in " Mr. Gowen's " ears, to con- 
 vince him of the profits resulting from the turning in 
 green crops instead of manure ; and if such a sys- 
 tem, on such a farm, at the end of five years, leaves 
 the purse well filled and the land in as high condition 
 as at the beginning, I shall not only confess that I 
 was wrong, but be willing to pay a premium of half 
 the value of the farm to the husbandman who had 
 worked such a miracle. 

Let it be remembered that it was such land, aS 
 this, not worn out land that I had in view, as may 
 easily be perceived by my remarks, for how could the 
 land be brought " into a state of poverty," that had 
 not been rich, but in poverty already ? If, Mr. Edi- 
 tor, you will take, the trouble to again glance at the 
 address, from which you have predicted that if I go 
 on at the rate you infer I am going, I will, as you
