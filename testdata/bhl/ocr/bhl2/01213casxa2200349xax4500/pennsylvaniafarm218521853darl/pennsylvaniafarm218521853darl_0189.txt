 Your obedient servant, James Gowen. 

Mount Any, Philadelphia, July 19th, 1852. 

Remarks. — We like the straight-forward spirit of 
 Mr. Gowen's remarks, and lind by them, that in the 
 main point at issue we are entirely agreed. That is 
 to say, that if Mr. Gowen simply wishes to affirm|that 
 there is no comparison in the value of barn-yard ma- 
 nure for keeping a farm in heart, and green crops, 
 we say Amen, with all our heart. No person has a 
 firmer faith in the value of barn-yard manure, than 
 ourself, as we believe that with plenty of it, and the 
 knowledge how to use it, one might smile, even at the 
 bottom lands of the west. But, as Mr. Gowen will 
 not deny, that the said bottom lands are the most fer- 
 tile lands in America, will he do us the favor to ask 
 himself how they became such a store house ef fer- 
 tility? By the deposit and decay of animal remains? 
 No. By the annual deposit for hundreds of years, of 
 vegetable remains ? Assuredly. Nature has been 
 plowing in green crops every year, on those bottom 
 lands, till they are most undeniably rich. 

So far we think Mr. Gowen will agree with us — 
 that there is virtue in decaying and decayed vegeta- 
 tion buried in the soil, whether in the shape of clo- 
 ver fplowed in or otherwise. But we no (v suppose 
 from reading his remarks, with which he has favored 
 us, in the above communication, that we have proba- 
 bly misapprehended him in another way. Mr. Gow- 
 en is not only a good practical former, but an excel- 
 lent teacher of husbandry, and in Pennsylvania and 
 the States south of it he notices that farmers neglect 
 their barn yard manures to follow the new fangled 
 fancies of plowing in green crops, using mineral ma- 
 nure, &c. He accordingly tells them that green crops, 
 under such circumstances, are not worth their atten- 
 tion, which ought to be devoted to the permanent en- 
 richment of their lands by the use of animal manure. 
 And the advice is the best of advice. We look upon 
 barn yard manure as the solid bullion, green crops, 
 gypsum, lime, &c., as the paper currency of hus- 
 bandry. But in many parts, we were going to say 
 most parts of the country, the bullion is scarce — is 
 only to be had in very limited quantities — so that not 
 a half or third of the farm lands can be well ma- 
 nured with it. In such a condition of things a far- 
 mer who wishes to mend his land and not lose his 
 profit, will, we think, occasionally employ the paper 
 currency to maintain and restore the credit of certain 
 fields that would come to a beggared condition, if 
 they had to wait for the bullion. Barn yard manure, 
 we say, with Mr. Gowen, before everything,|but if we 
 can't get enough of it,thcn we must not despise what 
 the experience of so many good husbandmen has 
 proved of decided benefit — grain crops plowed in. Ed.

To Make a Horsg Follow You. — You may make 

a horse follow you in ten minutes. Go to the horse, 
 rub his face, jaw and chin, leading him about, saying 
 to him, " Come along ;" a constant tone is necessary. 
 By taking him away from other persons and horses, 
 repeat the rubbing, leading and stopping. Sometimes 
 turn him around all ways, and keeping his attention 
 by saying, " Come along." With some horses it is 
 important to whisper to them, as it hides the secret 
 and gentles the horse ; you may use any word you 
 please, but be constant in your tone of voice. The 
 same will cause all horses to follow you. 

IMPROVED SPANISH MERINO SHEEP. 

We print on the preceding page a spirited engrav- 
 ing representing the Improved Spanish Merino Sheep, 
 recently inported by S. W. Jewet, Esq., of Weymouth 
 Vt., and now in possession of Messrs. II. S. Morse 
 and 0. F. Holbaird, where they justly excite the ad- 
 miration of ah who behold them. Mr. Jewett is well 
 known as one of our largest importers of improved 
 stock, and is now on his way to the Continent for the 
 purpose of attending to the shipment of about $15,000 
 worth of his last year's purchase, which we trust will 
 prove a profitable investment for him, as we hope it 
 will be a very important one for the friends of im- 
 provement in sheep-breeding throughout the country. 

In regard to the improved sheep of JMr. Jewett's 
 importation, a friend, who has had every opportunity 
 for observing them, remarks: 

"We wish those of our readers who have any taste 
 for fine animals could visit the establishments of our 
 friends, II. S. Morse, Esq., and 0. F. Ilolbaird, Esq., 
 at Shelburne, and look at the flocks of the new sheep 
 recently imported from France, It is difficult to 
 make those who have not seen them understand the 
 immense disparity between them and the ordinary 
 sheep. We had a chance to compare the two breeds, 
 in a shed where the common sheep and the French 

ones occupied two divisions in sight of each other. 

The natives made a sorry show indeed. They looked 
 as if they had pastured on a desert, and eaten this- 
 tles in winter, although they had iiad exactly the 
 same care and feed as the foreigners. The lambti of 
 the French breed, three months old, are just about 
 as large and heavy as a fuUgroAvn common rsheep; 
 and then the wool — it needs to be seen and felt in 
 order to be appreciated. They are mostly covered 
 thick with it, above and below, from the hoofs to the 
 tip of the nose. There is no waste room on them ; 
 and as one stands looking at them, it seems by no 
 means extravagant to suppose they can bear the 
 enormous fleeces that are attributed to them. Those 
 we saw at Mr. Morse's have had no feed except grass 
 and hay since their importation in August, and yet 
 they are in a better condition than any common sheep 
 we ever saw at this season. They are moreover ex- 
 tremely prolific and seem to bear this climate as well 
 as the natives. 

"We know very well that the truth with regard to 
 these sheep is so astonishing as to raise doubts amnno- 
 those who know nothing of them; but we feel sure 
 that a visit to them will remove all the doubts of the 
 skeptical. After looking over the flocks, and com- 
 paring their stalwart lambs with the full-grown sheep 
 of the common kind, we are convin(;ed that the gen- 
 eral introduction of the new breed in this country 
 will work a perfect revolution in the wool-<Trowin<T 
 business, and improve the quality of the muTton ou^t 
 of all proportion to the increase of trouble and ex- 
 pense. Nor did we wonder that the proprietors had 
 refused what sounds like the extravagant price of 
 S")50 for their best stock sheep. The result of the 
 enterprise, whether as respects the value of the im- 
 portation or the success of the importers, is nOw no 
 longer problematical. The demand fi)r the sheep is 
 steadily increasing, and already exceeds the supply.

 article, and for the article itself, we are indebted to

 work with which most of our readers are familiar.
