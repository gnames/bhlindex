Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 

The stated meeting- of 'his Society was held in the 
 Chinese Saloon, Philadelphia, on Tuesday evening-, 
 August 17th, — Dr. W. D. Brinckle, V. P., in the chair. 

There has not been at any former meeting for this 
 month, so fine a display of fruits as on this occasion 
 The competition was unusually spirited, and the com- 
 mittee for awarding premiums seldom have had their 
 powers of discrimination more thoroughly tested. — 
 In Grapes there were some ten contributors, who 
 presented such specimens as have rarely graced the 
 tables of the Society. The Black Hamburg variety 
 was in tho greatest profusion, and the White Nice 
 most beautiful. Of Nectarines, the Red Roman, 
 Elruge, New White and Newington varieties were 
 shown. Of Peaches there were a few dishes, one 
 particularly fine of Ward's — the tree raised in a pot 
 in Mr. Cope's green-house. The dishes of Plums 
 were very numerous and of many varieties; among 
 them were the Reine Claude, Flushing Gage, Bing- 
 ham Magnum Bonum, Gwash, Washington, Mira- 
 belle. Mammoth and oth t kinds. The table of Pears 
 wasa beuatiful sight, the specimens were perfect and 
 in great variety. The Apples in most instances re- 
 markably fine and of many kinds. 

This exhibition betokens a most fruitful season, and 
 is the harbinger of a rich display next month at the 
 American Pomological Congress, and the grand au- 
 tumnal of the Society, both of which will occur dur- 
 ing the week, commencing with the 13th. 

The collection of plants shown as very interesting. 

Peter Mackenzie's contained very many choice 
 Fuchias, Gloxinias, Geranium?, Verbenas, etc. 

Caleb Cope's had several recently introduced plants 
 and were shown for the first time — Oldenlandia Dep- 
 pei, Franciscea Vilosa, Gloxinia, Madame de Som- 
 breil and G. Napoleon, and beautiful specimens of 
 Russelia Juncea, Achimenes Venusta and grandi- 
 flora. Also a cut flower of the Victoria Regia, the 
 83d from the same plant, and seen for the first in its 
 second stage of growth, and a design among the 
 flowers ornamenting the same, were three specimens 
 of the Cereus glaucus {new), and beautiful baskets 
 of exotic and indigenous flowers. In John Lambert's 
 collection were fine plants of Pentas carnea, Roses, 
 Hydrangeas, Acacias, etc. 

Robert Buist exhibited a beautiful flower of the 
 Victoria regia, the second from a plant raised from 
 seed obtained from Caleb Cope, in a tank erected 
 expressly for that object, at his premises at Rosedale, 
 Kingsessing. 

The Designs, Baskets and Boquets were hand- 
 some and very creditable. 

The Vegetable tables groaned with their great 
 weight — which contained specimens of the finest 
 growth, exhibiting much skill in the cultivators.

 its spotted appearance, called ' Forelle Kopf Salat,^
