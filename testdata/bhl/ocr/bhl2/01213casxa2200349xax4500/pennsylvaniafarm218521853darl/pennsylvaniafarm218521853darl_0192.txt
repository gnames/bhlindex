 ripe and in fine condition, a Pennsylvania cherry of 
 large size and excellent quality. 

A box oi the Conestoga Cherry, from Mr. Casper 
 Hiller, from the original tree in Conestoga township, 
 Lancaster county. This is a large, firm fleshed pur-

Specimens of a large Raspberry from Dr. J. K. 
 Mitchell. This raspberry is fully equal to the true 
 Red Antwerp in size and flavor, and closely resem- 
 blinsr it in form. It is an accidental Seedling which 
 sprung up at the country seat of Dr. Mitchell, on the 
 Wissahickon, where no raspberries had previously 
 been cultivated. Though entirely unprotected, Dr- 
 M. assured us that it has withstood the two last win- 
 ters, without having received the slightest injury. — 
 This variety we have named the Wissahickon, and 
 strongly commend it to the favorable notice of horti- 
 culturists.

The following appropriate resolutions were unani- 
 mously adopted : — 

Resolved, that we deeply deplore the afflictive 
 providence which involved, in the destruction of the 
 Henry Clay and the tragical loss of many valuable 
 lives, the removal of our esteemed fellow member, 
 A. J. Downing, of Newburgh, in the pride of man- 
 hood, and in the full maturity of his powers, from the 
 scene of his useful and honorable exertions, at a time 
 when his services were so universally and highly ap- 
 preciated, and when his efforts in life were producing 
 throughout the land, the beneficent and beautiful re- 
 sults for which he had so long labored, and over 
 which his benevolent spirit would have so generously 
 rejoiced. 

Resolved, That we regard as a National bereave- 
 ment and affliction the loss of one whose powers were 
 so diligently and successfully dedicated to the purest 
 and best interests of his race and his country : that 
 the deceased was endowed by nature with a vigorous 
 intellect, which was elevated by liberal and prac- 
 tical cultivation, and directed by an expanded phil- 
 anthropy and a glowing love of nature, to the promo- 
 tion of those pursuits connected wit rural life and 
 rural happiness which, while they contribute to the 
 solid power and prosperity of a people, refine and el- 
 evate their tastes and enjoyments ; that the country 
 will hold in grateful and enduring remembrance his 
 valuable and popular contributions to the literature 
 of horticulture — his aid in the promotion of Land- 
 scape Gardening — in the improvement of the "Fruits 
 and Fruit Trees of America," and Cottage Residen- 
 ces, and his able and assiduous labors for the general 
 advancement of Pomology and rural economy : that 
 his efforts in these branches have produced an im- 
 provement which is perceptible in many sections of 
 our country • and that his sudden and melancholy 
 death is a bereavement which will be long and deep- 
 ly deplored far beyond the affectionate and afflicted 
 circle of which he was the ornament and pride. 

Resolved, That as the los3 of A. J. Downing is a 
 national calamity, calling for an appropriate national 
 commemoration, we cordially approve of the action 
 of the President of the American Pomolgoical Con- 
 gress in inviting the Hon. Marshall P. Wilder, an 
 intimate friend of the deceased, to deliver at the ap- 
 proaching session of the Congress in Philadelphia, 
 on the 13th proximo, a Eulogy on the life, character 
 and virtues of our lamented fellow member. 

Resolved, That we sincerely condole with his be- 
 reaved family upon this afflictive dispensation of an 
 inscrutable Providence ; and that as a manifestation 
 of our respect and sympathy, the Secretary be direct- 
 ed to transmit to them a copy of the foregoing resolu- 
 tions. On motion, adjourned. 

Thomas P. James, Rec. Sec'y.
