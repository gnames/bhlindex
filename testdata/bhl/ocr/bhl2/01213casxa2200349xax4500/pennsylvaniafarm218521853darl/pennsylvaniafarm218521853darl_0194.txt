ly strong muscles are none the less so ; and if the 
 good and bad qualities of the sire are transmitted 
 (even in a partial degree), to the offspring, is it not 
 the part of wisdom to use such measures as will be 
 most likely to implant those good qualities in the 
 sire ? I think so, and fully believe, that if the stal- 
 lions intended for service, were worked as other hor- 
 ses, are, or rather should be, we should soon see the 
 result in the more muscular forms of our colts.

Seedling Fruits. 

Mr. Editor. — In your July number, you request 
 of those knowing of seedling fruits of merit, that 
 they make them known to the public through the 
 medium of the Farm Journal. There are several 
 seedlings of merit in this neighborhood, some of 
 which have been cultivated to a limited extent, but 
 are not known abroad. In compliance with your re- 
 quest I offer the following: 

APPLES. 

Columbia, — Fruit large, roundish, skin smooth, 
 yellowish green in the shade, streaked and marbled 
 with yellow and red in the sun, stalk medium rather 
 stout and deeply inserted ; calyx set in a shallow 
 basin ; flesh yellow, tender, with a very rich, peculiar 
 flavor ; ripe in^October and November ; a profuse 
 bearer and worthy of a place in every garden. 

Traders' Fancy — Fruit medium roundish, narrow- 
 ing a little to the eye ; skin smooth, almost wholly 
 red. except in some specimens in the shade, with an 
 occasional bloted of russet ; stalk half an inch in 
 length, deeply inserted ; calyx set a ribbed basin of 
 moderate depth and partially closed ; flesh tender, 
 pale yellow, very nearly sweet ; a fine keeper — April 
 to June ; The trees are fine growers and good 
 bearers. 

PLUMS. 

Of these we have quite a number, I will, however, 
 describe but. two. 

Shepler's Facoritc — This superb looking plum is 
 undoubtedly one of the finest of early plums ; it suc- 
 ceeds admirably in all soils ; bears abundantly, keeps 
 well when taken from the tree gradually ripening, 
 fur a week or ten days, and frequently grows larger 
 thm Goes Golden Drop ; branches smooth and slen- 
 der; fruit of large size, oval with a faint suture 
 on one side of the fruit; skin first reddish, but be- 
 coming reddish purple in well ripened specimens, 
 profusely covered with a white bloom ; stalk three- 
 fourths of an inch long, set on one end of the fruit ; 
 flesh pale yellow, juicy, and, when at full maturity, 
 rich, sugary, and excellent ; it separates freely from 
 the very long, pointed stone ; ripe first August. 

Spotted Gage — Is a fruit of great excellence, and 
 is much admired ; forms an upright tree of thrifty 
 growth, young branches, downy fruit, rather above 
 medium size, roundish; skin beautifully mottled with 

greenish yellow and red, and covered with a thin, 
 white bloom, tlirough which the colors appear to be 
 blended together ; stalk half an inch long, slender in- 
 serted in a narrow, small cavity ; flesh yellowish, 
 juicy, and melting with a sprightly, vinous flavor ; 
 separates freely from the stone ; ripe last of August. 

CHERRIES. 

Early May — A variety that originated here about 
 thirty years ago ; fruit rather small, about as large 
 as the Bauman's May, ripening at the same time ; 
 skin deep red ; stalk an inch and a half long, slen- 
 der, set in a moderate hollow ; flesh tender, juicy, 
 sweet ; a first-rate variety, equal to Bauman's May. 

Lawrence Red — This cherry was originated by Mr. 
 Lawrence, of this county, from the seed of the Amer- 
 can Heart, and most undoubtedly is the par excel- 
 lence of all heart cherries ; fruit of medium size, 
 roundish, heart-shaped ; skin very smooth and trans- 
 parent, juice colorless,) of a soft but lively red,mottled 
 with amber in the shade ; stalk inserted with little 
 or no depression ; fruit borne thickly in clusters ; 
 flesh very tender and melting with a luscious, sweet 
 flavor; ripens from the fifteenth to twenty-fifth of 
 June. 

lleis Bigarreau — This valuable late cherry sprung 
 up on the farm of Mathias Ileis, in this county ; it is 
 purely of the Bigarreau class ; it is a regular and 
 great bearei", and is quite an acquisition, ripening 
 Irom ten days to two weeks after the cherry season, 
 and hangs for along time after ripening without rot- 
 ting; fruit large, obtuse, heart-shaped, borne in clus- 
 ters of three and four ; stalk one and a half inches 
 long, set in a pretty, deep broad, hollow; skin pale 
 yellow on the shaded side, with a beautiful blush 
 cheek ; flesh quite firm, juicy, with a rich, sweet fla- 
 vor ; in perfection from the tenth to the fifteenth of 
 July. 

PEARS. 

Doney Pear — This fruit was originated by an old 
 lady, by the name of Doney, some thirty years ago, 
 and has been considerably cultivated in this neigh- 
 borhood. The tree is rather short jointed, with yel- 
 lowish brown wood, is a moderate grower and a reg- 
 ular bearer; fruit scarcely of medium size, turbinate, 
 regularly formed ; skin smooth and fair, clear, bright 
 yellow, with an^occasional blush on the sun side ; 
 stalk an inch or more long, pretty stout, inserted 
 with little or no depression ; calyx small, closed, set 
 in a basin slightly shnk ; flesh white, buttery, sweet, 
 and good ; ripens first half of July. 

Monongahela Beiirre — (Wakefields) — This very ex- 
 cellent pear originated here, from the Seckel, it is 
 much larger than its parent and equally as good ; 
 the tree is hardy and forms a fine compact head, 
 succeeds well on the quince — no garden should be 
 without it ; fruit of medium size obovate ; skin a fine 
 golden yellow, with a blush cheek ; stalk pretty 
 stout, an inch long inserted, even with the surface
