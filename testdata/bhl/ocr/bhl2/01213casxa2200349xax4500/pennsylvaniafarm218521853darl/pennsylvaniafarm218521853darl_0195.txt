PEACHES. 

Of this fruit we have several fine seedlings, some 
 of them are very fine. 

Goe's Golden Mammoth — A very largo, freestone, 
 full fleshed peach, worthy of general cultivation ; 
 ripe in September. 

Ball's Yellow — As large as George the Fourth, and 
 equally as good — free — ripe first half of September. 

Ball's Claret — A beautiful cling, of first quality, 
 and largest size ; this is one of the best clings with 
 which I am acqainted ; ripe first half of September.

Letter from the Fruit Committee of the Pennsylvauia 

Horiicidiural Society. 

Mr. Editor : — Your valued favor of the 24th inst., 
 togethr, with the box of fruit, Avas received to-day. 

Please accept our cordial acknowledgments for 
 giving us an opportunity of again examining the 
 beautiful products of Lancaster. There is something 
 in your soil, climate, or skill, in cultivation, which 
 gives to your fruits a size and beauty that almost 
 prevents us from recognizing familiar kinds when 
 grown in your region. 

The four specimens of Ilosen Schenck from the 
 premises of the Hon. D. B. Vondersmith, are noble 
 specimens of this Pennsylvania pear. Two years 
 ago, we received the same variety, without a name, 
 from Dr. Eshleman, (who is doing so much for the 
 advancement of Pomolugy in Pennsylvania ;) we were 
 pleased with it, and called it the " Eshleman." Being 
 of large size, buttery consistence, and pleasant flavor, 
 it should be extensively disseminated. Mr. Huffy 
 has taken a colored drawing of it. 

The pears, No. 2, from Jacob Amwake, Esq., and 
 called the butter pear, there must be some mistake 
 about. They are evidently identicjil with the Hosen 
 Sehenck of Judge Vondersmith, and the specimens 
 are equally fine. 

" The pears, No. 3, Seedlings from John L. Wright, 
 of Columbia," not being in the box, were probably 
 accidentally left out. Could you not yet send them 
 to us? 

The six fine peaches had no numbers marked on 
 them, or on the papers in which they were separately 
 enveloped. We were, therefore, unable to discrimi- 
 nate between them. All, liowever, were clings of 
 large size and good flavor. 

The handsome apples from your garden we are in- 
 clined to think are large specimens of the Maiden's 
 Blush. 

The Gen. Hand plum, from the trees of Dr. Parry, 
 Jcaob Price, and Dr. Muhlenberg, we were much gra- 
 tified at seeing again. This mammoth Pennsylva- 
 nia variety is larger than the Washington, which it 
 closely resembles in quality and appearance. It may 
 be distinguished, however, from the latter, by the 
 Gen. Hand having a larger stem. Like the yellow 
 Magnum Bonum, it also has a fleshy ring in the ca- 
 vity where the stem is inserted. 

The Bottle Plum, a seedling from the Gen. Hand, 
 is a strange looking and unique variety. It presents 
 not a single characteristic of its parentage, being of 
 a red color and of a long pyriform shape. As this 
 plum was unripe, we should be happy to receive 
 specimens of it again when it has arrived at a state 
 of maturity. 

The four other varieties of seedling plums we were 
 pleased with, particularly with that from Messrs. 
 John Bear and John Zimmerman's No. 2, especially 
 those specimens of the latter that were grown by 3Ir. 
 F. W. Beates. 

With such convincing evidences of the capabilities 
 of Lancaster for producing fine fruit, we sincerely 
 hope you will be induced to send a strong delegation, 
 with an abundant supply of your noble specimens to 
 the American Pomological Congress which will as- 
 semble in Philadelphia on the 13th of September, 
 and to the annual Exhibition of the Pennsylvania 
 Horticultural Society, which will be held at the same 
 place on the 15th, 16th and 17th of the same month. 

Very truly yours, W. D. Brinckle.

Reaping Machines. 

Mr. Editor : — In the present onward march of 
 science it is gratifying to observe that agriculture 
 claims no small share of its attention. It is equally 
 gratifying to see what cautious, yet steady and cer- 
 tain application the farmer makes, (when convinced 
 of their utility,) of the various improvements calcu- 
 lated to enhance the profit of his occupation. I have 
 been induced to ask a place in your columns from the 
 fact of witnessing with what rapidity machinery is 
 made applicable to the use of the farm in this section 
 of Pennsylvania. Last year ushered in the use of 
 the grain drill, which was found to be of great 
 practical utility to the f\irmer, in the regularity and 
 depth of sowing, saving of seed, prevention of winter 
 kill, and in various other ways ; and this year we 
 find the farmers of our beautiful valley making prac- 
 tical use of the grain-reaper in harvesting the fruits 
 of their labors. Within a few weeks past there have 
 been introduced into our valley, and put in successful 
 operation several of McCormick's reapers, which meet 
 the full expectation of the farmers, and accomplish 
 all they are recommended to do. It is to the latter 
 article of machinery that I now wish to call the at" 
 tentioQ of the farmer. And it would be well, here to
