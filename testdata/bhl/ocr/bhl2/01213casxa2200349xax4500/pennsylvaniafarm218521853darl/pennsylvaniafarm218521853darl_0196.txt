say, that I am not any way personally interested, and 
 do not, for any individual interest, attempt to urge 
 upon tlie farmer the use of the reaper. Of Hussey's, 
 I am not able to say much, as I have not had an op- 
 portunity of witnessing its operations, although I 
 have been told that it works very well. Let us enter 
 into a calculation of the two modes of harvesting 
 •wheat, i. e., by the usual operation of the "man-pow- 
 er-cradlo-reapcr and the " horse-power-grain-reaper." 
 It has been ascertained here that " McCormick's 
 reaper" by the day and with 4 horses will harvest 
 20 acres allowing 8 men to bind, shock, &c. 
 Bythe usual mode 2men willharvest2 acres per day; 
 so we see that while 8 men with the " reaper" will 
 harvest 16 acres in one day : it will take the same 
 number of men 2^ daj's to harvest the same number 
 of acres, in the usual M-ay. And it is ?dmitted that 
 the " reaper" saves at least 1 bushel per acre, and 
 many think 11. I think it would be safe to put 
 the standard atl bushel per acre. Now, let us sum it 
 up, and see on which side the gain will be in har- 
 vesting 16 acres. By the usual mode we have 8 
 hands 21 days at $1,25 each day, §25,00 

Board of 8 hands 2} days, at 37i 

cents each daj, 7,50 

With the reaper we have, $32,50 

8 hands 1 day, at §1,25 cents each, 310,00 

Board of 8 hands 1 day at STg cts. each, 3,00 

Use of team, 1,50 

Use of reaper, 1,00 15,50 

Add 1 bushel per acre and we have, 

$17,00 
 16,00 

The sum of $33 gain In favor the reaper, $33,00 

in cutting but 16 acres. Does this not look surprising. 
 But who that will give it a fair investigation, will not 
 admit the fact ? Is this not an important item in 
 the expenses of the farm, and worthy the careful at- 
 tention of every farmer? Surely it is. There are 
 many instances whore the grain is [very heavy, 
 or lodged, in which the reaper will do the harvesting 
 with considerable more gain than above quoted, as 
 it will cut lodged and heavy wheat as easy as 
 ■wheat that will yield but 12 bushels per acre. Con- 
 sidering the advantages the great West has over the 
 Eastern States, in the richness of her soil, and in the 
 increasing facilities for transporting her products to 
 fill our eastern markets, thereby crowding out in a 
 measure, the products of our own States, and dimin- 
 ishing in price that which wo arc able to sell ; would 
 it not be well for all our eastern farmers, in order to 
 cope with this great competitor, to apply the use of 
 these, and all other machinery that will in any way 
 reduce the cost of raising, and bringing to market the 
 productions of the farm. The application of labor, 
 saving machines in all the various operations of 
 the farm, is a subject that demands attention, and 
 one that is sadly neglected by the great mass of our 
 farmers. C. M.

The Hoscn Scbenck Pear. 

Mr. Editor: — Being sorely afBicted with the 
 " Pear mania," and a little " craclced " on the sub- 
 ject of fruit in general, is sufficient cause for my de- 
 lay in asking several questions touching the above 
 subject, that interest me very much. 

In your June No. appeared a very interesting ar- 
 ticle, which from a subsequent communication from 
 your able correspondent, Mr. Garber, I supposed 
 from him ; in which, speaking of the Fruit of Lan- 
 caster county forty years ago, he mentions the But- 
 ter Pear and a " Seedling from it superior to its por 
 rent." Now, will you or he be so kind as to give a 
 history and description of said Seedling ? 

What is the origin of the Pear mentioned editori- 
 ally in the July No. p. 98, under the name of "Hosen 
 Schenck, than which none is earlier or finer?" — 
 About its earliness you certainly made a sliglit mis- 
 take ! 

I have been acquainted for several years with a 
 very good butter pear which I supposed a seedling of 
 Lancaster county, and as I first procured it from a 
 tree grown by a person of my own name, it was some 
 time so called, but generally enumerated as No. 9, 
 Priv. Cat. This season, for the first time, I have in 
 bearing the Hosen Schenck, and find them identi- 
 cal. I wonder very much if the seedling in Mr. Gar- 
 ber 's mind is not also identical? 

Will you be so kind as to investigate this matter, 
 and let us have through the Farm Journal the result. 

Downingtoivn, Aug. IZth, 1852. J. G. E. 

[Mr. Garber has promi-sed to answer these inqui- 
 ries in our next. We were slightly mistaken in re- 
 gard to the time of ripening. It ripens about the 
 latter part of August. In regard to its fine quality, 
 however, we think we were right, as we know of no 
 pear, unless it be the Bartlet or Seckel, over which 
 we would not unhesitatingly give it the preference.] 

Shelter for Stock iu Cold Weather. 

Mr. Editor: — Although the warmth of the present 
 season almost forbids the idea of writing, and more 
 especially of writing upon the subject of keeping cat- 
 tle comfortable in the winter season, I will yet at- 
 tempt a few Ijnes, detailing my experience on that 
 subject. 

The barn, or building rather, in which my cattle 
 for a number of years were sheltered, (if shelter it 
 could be called) was in a very dilapidated condition. 
 Expecting from year to year to be able to replace it 
 with a new one, I delayed many little repairs, which 
 I am since convinced it would have been true economy 
 to make several years before. I know the animals 
 suffered much from cold, and to compensate for their 
 sufferings, I fed them well; but while pursuing the 
 system a seeming necessity compelled me to adopt, I 
 could not but observe, on comparing notes with my 
 neighbors, that my cattle consumed considerably
