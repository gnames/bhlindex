more food than theirs, while at the same time their 
 condition was not only no better, but scarcely as 
 good. I attibuted this fact to any other but the right 
 cause. Knowing that some animals eat more than 
 more than others, without improving in an equal de- 
 gree, I presumed that mine were of this lean, hungry 
 kind, and thus dismissed the subject from my mind. 

Feeling somewhat stronger in pocket two years 
 since, I built a new barn. The shelter it afforded 
 my cattle was, as you may suppose, bettor than the 
 old one. The feed given my cattle during the first 
 winter was the same in quality and quantity as that 
 of the previous winter; but I was surprised to find 
 that in the spring, there was a decided improvement 
 in their condition over that of the preceding spring. 
 Last winter I found that T could keep them on at 
 least one fourth less food than ever before, and as I 
 am satisfied that they have not changed their natures, 
 I cannot attribute this saving of food to any other 
 cause than to the comfortable shelter provided for 
 them in the new barn, during the cold weather. 

I am aware that there are scientific principles upon 
 which this change may be accounted for ; but aspir- 
 ing to no prouder disticton than that of a plain prac- 
 tical farmer, I leave scientific explanations to those 
 more competent than myself, being content to record 
 the simple fact that I save one fourth of my cattle's 
 food by providing them with comfortable shelter du- 
 the winter season.

The ?fext Agricultural Fair. 

Mr. Editor : — In looking over your Farm Journal 
 I see that the next Agricultural Fair is to be held in 
 Lancaster, a place as suitable, I suppose, as could be 
 found, being a fine agricultural district and easy of 
 access from the different parts of the State. But my 
 object not being to dwell upon the advantages or dis- 
 advantages of the location, you will permit me to 
 throw out a few hints through your Farm Journal, 
 and also to make some inquiry about some state- 
 ments that I have heard ; and in doing so, permit me 
 to do it in my own way. The first hint is, we, 
 country folks, are opposed to imposition. "We do not 
 wish to be invited to Lancaster as we were to Harris- 
 burg, and charged treble or quadruple for lodging 
 and board. I think if the inhabitants of Lancaster 
 wish the Fair held there, they should certainly see 
 that those coming from a distance should not be im- 
 posed on, unless their object be altogether to make 
 money. One thing is certain — such conduct will soon 
 rid you of a portion of those that would otherwise at- 
 tend. I do not think it right for men to subscribe 
 largely in order to obtain the location, and then take 
 the advantage of necessity to enrich themselves there- 

Again, is it true that the Society gives a high' 
 er premium for a goose than for a colt ? 

port here is'^that Mr. Newcomer received a higher 
 premium for the best goose than Mr. Brugh did for 
 the best colt. Both of these men are from Franklin 
 county ; and if this is so, which I can scarcely credit , 
 I would like to know the reason it is not — it should 
 be contradicted ; such reports being calculated to in- 
 jure the Society and turn it into ridicule. There is 
 nothing of a worldly nature that I would rather sus- 
 tain than an Agricultural Society, and I have no 
 doubt but it will be sustained in our State if it is 
 carried on upon liberal principles ; but if not, it must 
 sink. The sustontation must come mainly from the 
 farmers themselves, and being hard-fisted they do not 
 generally deal in humbugs. It is quite probable 1 
 will be at the next Fair with a good number of my 
 neighbors, should we get assurance that our necessi- 
 ty will not be taken advantage of.

In our last we endeavored to satisfy the public 
 mind that a spirit of liberality towards their visitors 
 would characterize the conduct of the citizens of 
 Lancaster during the holding of the State Fair. — 
 We have had repeated assurances that such will be 
 the case ; so that, friend Thomson, we hope to sec 
 you and all of your neighbors with you. 

In regard to the award of a higher premium to 
 Mr. Newcomer than Mr. Brugh, a reference to the 
 published "list of premiums awarded" proves that it 
 is incorrect. The premium awarded to Mr. Brugh 
 was given upon the recommendation of the Commit- 
 tee, they, under the published regulations, not having 
 it in their power to designate the amount. The ar- 
 rangements of the first Exhibition were necessarily 
 imperfect. Enlarged experience will correct these 
 imperfections, as reference to the premium list for 

the coming fair will show. 

Clifton. 

Mr. Editor: — In your last number I observe you 
 have given the pedigree of the Horse Clifton, (which 
 took the premium at the last Agricultural Exhibition) 
 together with a notice of one of his colts, a two-year- 
 ling, which was also there and sold by the owner at 
 the time for $200, which colt found his way since to 
 Philadelphia, and changed owners at 8275. 

I am pleased to say this must be changed so far as 
 regards the sum sold for. In the changes made with 
 this colt, he has given such satisfixction that the 
 present owner of him would not take eight hundred 
 dollars for him — One who knows. C.
