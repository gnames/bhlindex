PORTRAIT OF S. P. CHAPMAN'S SHORT- 
 HORN nui.t. 

S. p. Chapman's Short-Horn Bnll '' Ilalton/' 
 awarded the first prize b}- the New York State Agri- 
 cultural Society, at llochester, in 1851, in chiss of 
 "Foreign Stock;" being then owned and exhibited by 
 the Hon. Adam Ferguson, of AVoodhill, Watordown, 
 C. W. 

To the Editors of the Plough, the Loom, and the An- 
 vil: 

In presenting you and your readers with a portrait 
 of "llalton," allow me to give also his pedigree. 

His color is a beautiful red roan. He was bred by 
 Geo. Yail, Esq., of Troy, N. Y.; calved 2()th August, 
 1847 ; got by Meteor, 104 ; dam [Lady Barrington 
 iii.] by Cleveland Lad (3,407); grand dam [Lady 
 Barrington, ii.] by Belvidere (1,70G); gr. g. d. [Lady 
 Barrington] by a son of Mr. Mason's llerdman (304); 
 gr. gr. g. d. [Young Alicia] by Wonderful (700) ; gr. 
 gr. gr. g. d. [Old Alicia] by Alfred (23); gr. gr. gr. 
 gr. g. d. by Young Favorite, son of Favorite (252). 

Meteor, the sire of Halton, was by Duke of Well- 
 ington, 55 (3, G54); dam [Duchess] by Mr. Bates' 
 celebrated Duchess, prize bull, Duke of Northum- 
 berland (1,940), &c. &c. 

Lady Barrington iii., Duchess, and Duke of Well- 
 ington, were bred by the late Thomas Bates, Esq., of 
 Kirklevington, Yorkshire, England, and imported by 
 Mr. Vail. It will be seen, therefore, that Halton is 
 descended directly from the justly celebrated Bates 
 Stock. 

Speaking of the Barrington family, Mr. Robert 
 Bell, the friend and tenant of the late Thos. Bates, 
 Esq., in a letter to Mr. Vail, of July 31st, 1851, re- 
 marks: "I h«ve no hesitation in saying that there is 
 not a better tribe of cattle in England than the Bar- 
 ringtons. I have had several applications for the 
 old cow [Lady Barrington] lately, although she is 
 sixteen or seventeen years old; but I would not sell 
 her, intending to keep her as long as she will breed. 
 .... I have now a heifer, from a daughter of your 
 Lady Barrington iii., by fourth Duke of York, [the 
 sire of Mr. Vail's imported heifer, "Yarm Lass," S. 
 P. C] not yet a year old, for which I would not take 
 less than 100 guineas ($500). The reason why I 
 think so much of the Barringtons is, theji haveplenty 
 of hair, are good handlers, and most excellent milkers, 
 qualities that many short-horns do not possess." Mr. 
 Vail, in a letter to me of the 19th August, 1851, fol- 
 lows this extract by saying: "I have now four cows 
 and heifers of this tribe. My three which give milk 
 are all good milkers, which corresponds with what 
 Mr. Bell says about this family of short-horns.\ 
 Very respectfully yours, 

S. P. Chapman.
