THE ABOVE DRILL is not liable to get out of 
 repair, is exceedsniy simple in its construction, will 
 sow point rows in all irregular shaped fields, andpos- 
 sessess superior advantages to all others in the ease 
 and quickness with which it can be regulated to sow 
 any desired quantity of Grain per Acre^ while the 
 draft upon the horses is twenty-five per cent, lighter, 
 and consequently with the same labor, can seed one- 
 tourth more ground per day than with most other 
 machines now in usf^. The objection so common to 
 Drilling Machines of becoming Choked if the seed is 
 not perfectly cleaned, is entirely obviated in the Sim-

MYERS' CHEMICAL ANIMAL MANURE. 

Tliat of (iffering to the public a Manure which comprises al 
 that CduUt he wished — its cheapness and surprising effects in pro 
 ducing hirger crops in any kind of soil — is lasting and enduring 
 qualities. 

The subscriber offers this Manure to the public with a full knowl- 
 edge of its powerful effects npon ground where used. This Ma- 
 nure must take its precedence above all others ; its adaption to all 
 kinds of gciil, and every particle of fertilizing properties being 
 preserved in the mode of manufacture, render it at once cheaper 
 than any other manure used for all kinds of crops. Its effects are 
 wonderful A supply always on hand, WM. MYERS,

KEAD THK FOLLOWING CERTIFICATES

 - ™" i^tr. Wm. Myers— Sir— Having tried your fhemico-Animal 
 Manure upon potato ground, this season, I find it produce one-third 
 more and larger potatoes than the best horse manure ( n the same 
 g''""'«i- WM. K. Cox. 

The followmg additional certificate just received, speaks for itself.

I have used upward of lOUO bushels of Wm. Mveks' Animal 
 Manure, on corn, potatoes, turnips, melons, and some other crops 
 during the present season, and am satisfied that it is an economical 
 and powerful manure, for turnips, radislies, and other root crops— 
 my experience has shown it to be especially valuable

Mr, W m. Myers— Dear Sir— I manured with yonr Chemico-Ani- 

caps and short straw will not interfere in the least 
 with the regular distribution ot the seed. It is war- 
 ranted to distribute the seed evenly; to sow any 
 quantity per acre commonly sown broadcast; to not 
 cut or break the grains ; to be well made with good 
 materials and durable with proper care. 

Having sold about 400 of the above Drills the past 
 season, all of which met with the unqualified appro- 
 bation of the purchasers ; and after careful and thor- 
 ough experiments, which have resulted in Still Great- 
 er Improvements, we now feel warranted in saying 
 that Moore's Patent Seed and Grain Planter improv- 
 ed, is superior to any other machine for the purpose, 
 now in the market. 

Having made arrangements to furnish 1000 of the 
 above Machines for sale the coming Season, we shall 
 be prepared, at all times, to supply orders without 
 delay. 

8@°"A11 orders addressed to the undersigned will 
 warrant prompt attention.

mal Manure about 38 acres of the poorest land on my farm, and put 
 half in Oats, and tl e balance in Corn. Although it was got in 
 quite late, and the Season very unfavorable for the Corn crop gen- 
 erally, yet notwithstanding, 1 can say that it is decidedly the best 
 Corn I ever raised, although I have farmed for 20 years, and have 
 had good Corn land,andManured wel|,as I thouglit,in the old way. 
 While my neighbors' Corn was quite yellow and leaves curled up 
 with the drought, mine was green and growing rapidly; therefore, 
 I consider it one of the most valuable manures I ever used, and 
 shall take pleasure in recommending it to my neighbors and others. 
 Yours respectfully, E. M. Seelv. 

SIDLE'S HUB, AUGUR AND BOX REGULATOR. 

THE subscriber residing in Dillsburg, York county, Pennsylva- 
 nia, has invented a new and improved Augur for the boring of hubs, 
 and setting the boxes of wagon, carriage and other vehicle wheels 
 for which 1 have obtained letters patent. 

The Augur will bore both ends of the hub at the same time, or 
 either separately — and is the most useful and important invention 
 of the age for inserting wagon boxes and the only Machine in ex- 
 istence by which they can be inserted exactly true — and is so per- 
 fectly simple in its construction, and constructed on such just me- 
 ehanical principles, that it cannot possibly get out of repair. 

With this Augur a set of boxes can be inserted in a few minutes 
 — where under the old system it requires hours to perform the 
 same amount of work. 

Persons wishing to purchase Territory or Shop rights will please 
 address the subscriber, who will sell on terms that will enable the 
 purchaser to make m(mey. HENRY SIDLtE.
