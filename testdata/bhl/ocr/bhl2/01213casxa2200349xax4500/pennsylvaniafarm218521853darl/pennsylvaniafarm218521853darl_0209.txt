500 AGENTS WANTED. 

"We are desirous of securing one or more competent 
 agents in every county in Pennsylvania, to canvass 
 for the Farm Journal. Our terms are liberal, and 
 we are assured by well-informed friends in every por 
 tion of the State, that competent and active agents 
 could not fail to succeed well. We therefore invit 
 persons desirous of taking agencies to address us 
 {postpaid) on the subject ; furnishing us with satis- 
 factory reference, and stating in what particular 
 county they are desirous of canvassing. 

Agents at the State Fair. 
 We shall be glad to secure the services of a num- 
 ber of efficient agents at the State Fair, for the pur- 
 pose of soliciting subscriptions to the Journal. Per- 
 sons who are willing to engage in the work, can ob- 
 tain information in regard to terms, &c., on applica- 
 tion at our office, either by letter or in person. 

The State Fair. 
 As this will be the last opportunity we shall have 
 before the State Fair, we again most earnestly invito 
 the friends of agriculture and the mechanic arts to 
 become contributors. That the display will be an 
 immense one we have every assurance, not onl}^ from 
 our own citizens, but from those residing in distant 
 States. We have just received a letter from A. S. 
 Bingham of West Cornwall, Vermont, which informs 
 us that he will attend the exhibition with a choice 
 flock of his celebrated Merino Sheep. A few of these 
 will be disposed of, if purchasers can be had. Mr. 
 B.'s merinos took the premium at the last State Fair. 
 We have also letters from every section of Pennsyl- 
 vania, advising us of delegates who will be in at- 
 tendance, and stock and articles preparing for exhi- 
 bition, so that those who purpose attending merely 
 as spectators, will be gratified with a large and va- 
 ried display. 

Unpaid Subscriptions. 

Those of our subscribers who have so promptly 
 complied with our request to remit the amount stand- 
 ing against them on our books for subscriptions, will 
 please accept our thanks. To those still in arrears 
 we renew the request contained in our last, viz : that 
 they will have the kindness to settle up at once. The 
 number is not great, but as we arc desirous of mov- 
 ing upon the cash principle as nearly as possible, 
 we hope our request will be complied with. 

Eulogy on JIr. Downing. — At the earnest request 
 of a number of our subscribers, we publish entire, the 
 eulogy on the character of the late A. J. Downing, 
 pronounced before the National Pomological Society, 
 by lion. M. P. Wilder, of Massachusetts. It is the 
 tribute of a warm personal friend to the memory of 
 one who has endeared himself to every American 
 citizen, and as such, it will be read with deep inter- 
 est. Its length has crowded out a number of inter- 
 esting articles, which will be presented in our next.
