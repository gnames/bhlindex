Pennsylvania Poultry Society. 

The poultry breeders of Pennsylvania have at 
 length became sufficiently infected with the hen 
 fever to form themselves into an association, the ob- 
 ject of which is to improve our poultry generally. 
 We are right down glad to hear it, and wish the en- 
 terprise god-speed ; as we are perfectly well satis- 
 fied of tlie fact that no department of our domestic 
 household require or deserve it more. There are 
 those who sneer at the efforts making to improve the 
 character of our poultry generally, regarding the 
 movement as one originating with speculators, and 
 designed to entrap the unwary. Now while we are 
 free to admit that most shameful impositions have 
 been practised by some breeders upon unsuspecting 
 persons, we are by no means willing to believe that 
 all who have been engaged in rearing poultry are of 
 this class. That the movement will result in the im- 
 provement of our poultry we have not a doubt, just 
 as the introduction of improved breeds of cattle, 
 horses, &c., has been the means of raising the char- 
 acter of other portions of our farm yard stock. 

We have not seen the constitution ot this new so- 
 ciety, but understand that the membership fee is $1, 
 — that there will be an annual exhibition — that the 
 first one will be held in Philadelphia on the last 
 Tuesday in October, at the Rising Sun, Phila. Co., — 
 that an address will be delivered on the occasion — 
 that H. J. Brown, M, D., has been selected as the 
 orator, and that the following is a list of the officers :

The Board of Managers has especial care of the 
 Annual Exhibition ; it has, indeed, entire control of 
 it. The officers of the Society are, ex-officio, mem- 
 bers of it. 

Cornell's Patent Self-Regulating Horse Pow- 
 er. — We had an opportunity a few days since of 
 witnessing the operation of this superior horse power, 
 and if we are competent to pronounce upon its merits, 
 feel no hesitancy in recommending it to the attention 
 of farmers generally. It possesses, we think, a great 
 many advantages over the powers in general use, such 
 as a greater amount of power, at a less elevation — a 
 self-regulator, which controls its speed in a most ef- 
 fectual manner, — and other points which will best be 
 understood by an examination of the machine itself. 
 It is Mr. Cornell's intention to exhibit it at the State 
 Fair and challenge every other power on the ground 
 to a fair trial, in order that the superiority may be 
 be credited to where it properly belongs. That is 
 the right spirit. 

Arrangements for the State Fair. 

The arrangements for the coming Exhibition are 
 fast verging to completion. The Chairman of the 
 Committee of Arrangements has politely informed us 
 that the Lancaster County Society have contracted 
 for, and have everything ready for putting up the 
 fencing, shedding, &c. Large handbills have been 
 issued by the committee of arrangements, inviting 
 the attendance of the public from b11 quarters. 

The same committee have made arrangements 
 with the forwarding men of Lancaster, who, with the 
 lumber and coal men, have kindly promised all the 
 sidelings (of rail-way) that they can spare, and will 
 charge no storage for articles sent to the Exhibition 
 or any expenses, except what may be actually paid 
 by them to persons, assisting to unload. 

David Hartman, is appointed receiver at the rail- 
 road, and any article sent for exhibition, not accom- 
 panied by the owner, if directed to him will be taken 
 care of and properly deposited on the exhibition 
 grounds. 

The grounds will be arranged in the best and most 
 complete manner, and the hotel keepers and citizens 
 of Lancaster are making every preparation to make 
 visitors comfortable. 

Pennsylvania Mutual Live Stock Insurance 
 Company. — Attention is asked to the advertisement 
 of this company. We are assured on the best au- 
 thority, this the association in a reliable one, and if 
 60 cannot fail to prove useful. It being the only one 
 in Pennsylvania, we presume, persons desirous of in- 
 suring their stock, will give it preference over those 
 located in distant States. An agency will shortly 
 be established in Lancaster.
