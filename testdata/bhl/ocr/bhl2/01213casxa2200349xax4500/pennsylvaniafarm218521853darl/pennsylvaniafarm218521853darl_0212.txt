'OrTOBER, 

in my own experience, no better one to recommend. 
 It is as follows, and, no doubt, would well pay a trial 

of it: 

»' Remo' e the earth around the base of the tree, 
 crush and destroy the borers and cocoons which may 
 be found in it, and under the bark; cover the wound- 
 ed parts with a composition of common clay ; and 
 surround the trunk with a strip of sheathing paper 
 eifht or nine inches wide ; which should extend two 
 inches below the soil, and be secured with strings 
 above. Fresh mortar should then be placed around 
 tlie root, so as to confine the paper and prevent ac- 
 cess beneath it, and the remaining cavity filled with 
 unexhausted loam. This operation should be per- 
 formed in the spring or during the month of June. — 
 In winter the strings may be removed, and in the 
 spring following, the trees should again be examined, 
 and the protecting application be renewed."

 Fruit Growing iu Pennsylvania. 

The fruit growers of Pennsylvania during the last 
 forty years have so far improved in their modes of 
 culture and selection of varieties, as somewhat to in- 
 crease the resulting profits. But the growing of 
 fruit has been considered a branch of general farm- 
 ing, of less importance than raising of grain or breed- 
 ing of cattle, and therefore has not received the at- 
 tention necessary to make it highly profitable. 

In many sections of th-? country, especially those 
 remote from large towns, fruits were frequently raised 
 from seedling or ungrafted trees, and therefore a 
 very small proportion were good or first rate varie- 
 ties, but apples and pears were abundant of such 
 kinds as were suitable for cooking and for cider. — 
 Fine seedling varieties were occasionally originated, 
 and sparingly propagated by grafting, and thus be- 
 came partially known in small districts, and almost 
 unheard of beyond those limits. It is true, that there 
 have been many persons, who have given considera- 
 ble attention to the selection and cultivation of fine 
 fruits; but they have labored in the cause separately; 
 with little connexion with each other, and the knowl- 
 edge and experience gained by each in his life time, 
 was chiefly lost to the community at his death. — 
 William Coxe, of Burlington, New Jersey, published 
 a work in 1817, describing 130 varieties of apples and 
 65 of pears, and some other fruits, but I judge that 
 its circulation was limited in Pennsylvania, and that 
 its effect was not very perceptible, except that some 
 Jersey varieties were introduced through its means. 
 No work of that kind had a large circulation here till 
 about 1846, when A. J. Downing published his "Fruits 
 and Fruit Trees of America," which seems immedi- 
 ately to have awakened the attention of the public to 

the growing of fruit and created a demand for fruit 
 trees of the varieties described, probably by shewing 
 that such existed, and that they might be obtained. 
 The varieties described were principally those known 
 and cultivated in New York and New England, a 
 small proportion only of them being in cultivation 
 here, Tiie result has been, that our own best varie- 
 ties have been neglected, and a great number of kinds 
 have been introduced from the eastward ; some of 
 which have fully answered the expectations of those 
 who introduced them, and others have not ; but neith- 
 er the success nor the disappointment, has abated the 
 increased attention to the culture of frhit. The ex- 
 perience that has been had with varieties introduced 
 from other places, has produced the belief that there 
 are many varieties of fruits that are jnstly reputed to 
 be of the first quality both in flavor and productive- 
 ness in one locality, that suffer change in those re- 
 spects when placed in other situations ; and the ef- 
 fect of climate seems to be shown in the earlier ri- 
 pening of fruits when grown in a more southern lati- 
 tude. Thus some varieties that are regarded aswin- 
 ter fruits in the northern part of N. England become 
 autumn fruits in Penn'a. and further south. There 
 is therefore less danger of being disappointed when 
 we select fruit trees of varieties that have originated 
 or have been sufficiently proven in our respective 
 neighborhoods than when we procure them from dis- 
 tant places. 

Agricultural Societies have been established in 
 several counties in eastern Pennsylvania, within a 
 few years past, and at their annual exhibitions held 
 in autumn, there has usually been fruit exhibited of 
 the kinds ripe at that season. By means of these ex- 
 hibitions and of the inquiries and researches made by 
 amateurs and by the fruit committees of these socie- 
 ties, a considerable number of fruits of first qualities 
 have been discovered and brought into cultivation ; 
 and the past success authorizes the expectation that 
 inquiries more carefully made and widely extended, 
 will bring to public notice fruits of first quality 
 suited to our climate, soil, situation, and exposure, 
 superior to many kinds at present in cultivation. To 
 aid these inquiries the members of the respective 
 societies should be invited to forward to the monthly 
 meeting of the society, or to their executive or spe- 
 cial fruit committee, monthly, or in shorter periods, 
 during the fruit season, such seedling or little known 
 varieties of fruit as may be deemed of excellent 
 quality and highly deserving of cultivation ; and as 
 we now cultivate more than a sufficient number of 
 varieties, no new one should be adopted without it 
 possesses some valuable property rendering it more 
 worthy of cultivation than the variety to be discon- 
 tinued to furnish it a place.
