C. Baldwin 32, and H. Darlington, 32 varieties, and 
 there were several other smaller contributors. 

Of peaches there was not so great an abundance 
 as usual, but several plates were shown of extraordi- 
 nary size and quality, including some new seedlings 
 The premium for the best display of fruits of all 
 kinds, was awarded to A. Marshall &. Co. 

Too much cannot be said in praise of the vegeta- 
 bles, as regards size, variety, and quality. Single 
 specimens of cabbages, beets, tomatoes, egg plants, 
 seemed as if grown to supply the tables, not of a 
 small family, but a small neighborhood. It is ques- 
 tionable however, whether such monsters are equal 
 in flavor to those of smaller size. The first premium, 
 for the best display was awarded to Josiah Hoopes, 
 for 82 varieties ; the second to Paschall Morris & 
 Co., who exhibited 75 varieties. 

In the flower department, the first prem.ium was 
 awarded to Paschall Morris &. Co. In their collec- 
 tion we observed fine specimens of achimenes, also, 
 Veronica Lindleyana, Habrothamnus Elegans, Fus- 
 chia Syringaflora arborea, Forrenia Asiatica, Pentas 
 Carnea, Mariettia Glabra, Plumbagos, Fuschias, &c. 
 They also received the first premium for the best 12 
 Verbenas, and for their display of 35 new and choice 
 Dahlias. 

This firm also exhibited 120 specimens of Ever- 
 green Trees and Shrubs, many of them new and rare 
 varieties, which attracted much attention. Among 
 them was Cupressus Funebris, Arancaria Imbricata 
 and Braziliensis, Deodar and Lebanon Cedars, Cryp- 
 tomeria Japonica, Pinus Insignis, Pinus Douglasii, 
 Taxodium Sempervirens, 15 varieties of Hollies, 15 
 of Junipers, several of Taxus, &c 

Of Boquets and Moss Baskets there was a good 
 collection, and the tout ensemble of the whole exhi- 
 bition was highly creditable to the Society and to the 
 county of Chester. Many of our native and seedling 
 Fruits, give promise of great merit, and only require 
 to be known to be properly appreciated. Enough has 
 been done to prove that in this county, and in our 
 own State, the different kinds of fruit can be grown 
 equal to any other section of the Union, and much 
 better than in many — nothing being wanting but at- 
 tention to this as a branch of the business of our 
 farms, the same as we bestow on other crops, and a 
 proper understanding of the principles of Fruit Cul- 
 ture. Why cannot we have here as in Ohio, a State 
 Pomological Society? Observer. 

Shall we have a State Pomological Society. 

Mr. Editor : — Returning from our attendance at 
 the meeting of the National Pomological Society, a 
 friend — one of the most devoted and successful fruit 
 growers in our State — asked, "Why can we not 
 have a State Pomological Society in Pennsylvania 1" 

and we now repeat the inquiry. Why can we notl 
 There is no good reason why we should not have 
 such a society, and a very great many cogent ones 
 why we should. The recent meeting of the National 
 Pomological Society in Philadelphia, has, we are 
 pleased to observe, had the efl^ect of opening the eyes 
 of our own fruit growers to the fact, that while our 
 eastern friends deserve the palm for endless variety 
 of pears, Pennsylvania certainly takes the lead in 
 all that constitutes real excellence. With our East- 
 ern friends, rarely any thing is done by halves. 
 Whether in chickens or cattle, notions or pears, 
 those who lead the van never stop short of a com- 
 plete assortment. This feature in their character 
 was strikingly illustrated atthe National Convention. 
 The great point in competition appeared to be, not 
 who shall display the finest pears? but who has the 
 greatest number of varieties'? The simple fruit 
 growers (like ourselves) from the interior — who 
 though we knew that French pears abounded in 
 endless variety, had never before had an opportunity 
 of examining so many different kinds — gazed on the 
 varied display in utter amazement. By this we 
 would not be understood to say that we were amazed 
 at either the beauty or excellence of the pears exhi- 
 bited, but that so many of the boasted French pears 
 were in reality so little worthy of cultivation. True, 
 many of the specimens exhibited were far from being 
 matured, and perhaps, had an opportunity of tasting 
 their flavor been given, a majority of them would 
 have passed muster as "good," and some well known 
 varieties as Jlrst rate ; but the halo of glory which 
 had hitherto invested French pears, departed from 
 the minds of many upon first sight. Has the season 
 been unpropitious ? We think not. Has Boston 
 skill in pear cultivation degenerated ? Not if we 
 are to believe their journals. Have Boston cultiva- 
 tors of the pear ever succeeded in bringing French 
 varieties to the perfection with which they are 
 grown in France 7 This has been repeatedly claimed 
 for them, and if the claim has been truthfully ad- 
 vanced, then in our humble opinion we must go 
 farther than France for pears superior to the Bartleft, 
 Seckel, a few standard French varieties, and a host 
 of our own natives, among which we are proud to 
 enumerate the Diller and Hosenschenck, the King- 
 sessintT and Brandywinc, the Ott and the Pennsyl- 
 vania pear. Wc do not by this design to underrate 
 the energy and skill of the gentlemen who contri- 
 buted so largely of eastern pears. Their spirit is 
 worthy of the highest commendation. We honor 
 them for the zeal they have manifested in the culti- 
 vation of this delicious fruit, and thank them for the 
 opportunity afforded us of examining the products of 
 their laudable emulation. But while we thus " ren- 
 der into Cffisar the things which are Csesar's" we
