COMMUNICATIONS. 

[October, 

cannot forbear the expression of our honest opinion, 
 that wc have a sufficient number of native pears of 
 the most delicious character — ripening- at all seasons 
 from tlie earliest to the latest — to supersede the ne- 
 cessity of importing more from abroad. Let those 
 who have the means and inclinations, stock their 
 grounds with all the different varieties, but to such 
 persons as are desirous of securing truly valuable 
 fruit, we say, stick to the old standard kinds. 

But to return to the point whence we started in 
 the commencement of this article, and from which 
 we have so widely diverged ; " Shall we have a 
 Pomological Society in Pennsylvania]" We hope 
 there will be but a single response to this query — a 
 universal Yes ! and that immediate steps will be 
 taken to effect an organization. It may be urged as 
 an objection that there already exists a State Horti- 
 cultural Society. True there does, and a noble one 
 it is ; but it does not precisely meet the wants of the 
 fruit growers of the interior. It is too local in its 
 character, although it extends the most cordial invi- 
 tation to fruit growers in every section to participate 
 in its transactions. Although in existence for many 
 years, it is clearly manifest that there are thousands 
 of choice native fruits within the limits of cur State, 
 the merits of which have never been known beyond 
 the immediate vicinity in which they originated, and 
 it requires a new organization — a more general feel- 
 iug of interest than has hitherto manifested itself, to 
 brmg these treasures to public knowledge. A State 
 Fruit Society would best develope them, and the 
 holding of annual or semi-annual exhibitions, in vari- 
 ous sections would have the effect of infusing a spirit 
 of emulation, which could not fail to be productive 
 of the very best results to the fruit growing interest. 
 We again put the question, " Shall we have a Penn- 
 sylvania Pomological Society]" If any are opposed 
 to the proposition, we shall be glad to hear from 
 them through the Journal. J. G. B. 

[We heartily second the motion of our corres- 
 pondent, for the immediate organization of a State 
 Pomological Society. The readers of the Journal 
 will remember that from the first, we have asserted 
 the superiority of Pennsylvania fruits, and contend- 
 ed for such an arrangement as would best develope 
 tlieir character and particular localities. It is a source 
 of gratification to us to find that we are beginning to 
 be sustained in the position we have taken. Every 
 one who attended the sessions of the Pomological 
 Society, could not fail to have been struck with the 
 immense superiority of Pennsylvania fruits exhibit- 
 ed. There was perhaps not such an endless variety, 
 and not as many contributors as there should have 
 been; but enough was seen to convince every one 
 that we have within our borders all the elements of 
 a first rate fruit growing district. We therefore ' 

hope that immediate steps for the organization of a 
 State Pomological Society will be taken. Who will 
 take the lead 1 — Ed. 

Advantages of Thorough Tillage. 

Mr. Editor : — A century ago, Jethro TuU advoca- 
 ted with all his powers, the theory, that the coil 
 might be rendered fertile, merely by effecting its 
 complete pulverization. While practice has proven 
 TuU to be wrong in expecting such great results, it 
 has proven also that to a very considerable extent 
 the author of "Horse Hoe Husbandry" was right. — 
 Indeed it may be asked whether his system was not 
 as nearly correct as that pursued by the majority of 
 farmers at the present day, who plow shallow, har- 
 row slightly, never use the roller, and endeavor to 
 make a cart load of manure answer for an acre of 
 ground. But as my object is not to institute a com- 
 parison between TuU's and this modern " skinning " 
 system, but simply to show the advantages arising 
 from a complete pulverization of the soil, permit me 
 to enumerate briefly what some of these advantages 
 are. 

It is well known to all vegetable physiologists,that 
 after a certain period, roots do not grow by a general 
 distension of their tissue, but by the addition of new 
 matter to their points, and that these points are ex- 
 ceedingly delicate and very liable to injury. The 
 important functions these spongelets perform, in feed- 
 ing the plant, clearly indicate the necessity of the 
 greatest care on the part of the cultivator, to put 
 his soil in such condition as will best enable them to 
 discharge these functions properly. Now what is 
 this condition. It is evidently to keep it in such a 
 degree of pulverization, that the greatest possible 
 amount of nutriment for the growing plant, may be 
 absorbed by the delicate spongelets or feeders. — 
 Again, as a square yard of soil contains more nutri- 
 tious matter than a square foot of the same quality, 
 it is evident that if the roots of a plant are enabled 
 to penetrate every portion of that square yard as 
 freely as they could have the square foot, the advan- 
 tage derived by the plant would be greatly increased. 
 The fibrous roots are too delicate to penetrate the 
 clods that abound in too many of our newly seeded 
 grounds, consequently, all the fertilizing properties 
 contained in those lumps are lost, and the plant suf- 
 fers. 

Hear what Jethro TuU says upon this point. " I 
 have had the experience of a multitude of instances 
 which confirms it (good tillage) so far, that I am in 
 no doubt that any soil, be it rich or poor, can ever 
 be made too fine by tillage, for one cubical foot of 
 this minute powder may have more internal super- 
 ficies, than a thousand feet of the same or any other 
 earth, tilled in the same manner ; and I believe no 
 two arable earths in the world, do exceed one anoth- 
 er in their natural richness twenty times, that is, one
