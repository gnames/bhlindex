organic matter. Now, green vegetable substances 
 contain -within themselves much water, and undergo 
 decomposition more readily therefore, than such as 
 have been dried, and are more immediately servicea- 
 ble when mixed with the soil. 

In the sap of plants also there generally exist cer- 
 tain compounds containing nitrogen, which not only 
 decompose very readily themselves, but have the 
 property of persuading or inducing the elements of 
 the other organic matters, with which they are in 
 contact, to assume new forms or to enter new chemi- 
 ical combinations. Hence, the sap of plants almost 
 invariably undergoes more or less decomposition 
 even when preserved from the contact of both air and 
 water. When this decomposition has once com- 
 menced in the sap, it is gradually propagated to the 
 woody fibre and other substances of which the mass 
 of the stems and roots of the plant is composed. — 
 Hence, recent vegetable matter will undergo a com- 
 paratively rapid decomposition, even when buried to 
 a depth beneath the soil — and the elements of which 
 it is composed will form new compounds more or 
 less useful to living plants, in circumstances where 
 many forms of even partially decomposed vegetable 
 matter would undergo no change whatever. 

Further — when green vegetable matter is allowed 
 to decay in open air, it is gradually resolved more or 
 less completely into carbonic acid, which escapes into 
 the air and is so far lost. But when buried beneath 
 the surface, this formation of carbonic acid proceeds 
 less rapidly, and other compounds — preparatory to 
 the final resolution into carbonic acid and water — 
 are produced in greater quantity and linger in the 
 soil. _ Thus by burying vegetable substances in his 
 land in their green state, the practical man actually 
 saves a portion of the organic food of plants, which 
 would otherwise so far run to waste. 

Grain Weevil in Barns. 

Mr. Editor: — Your correspondents, Mr. Samuel 
 Miimma of Dauphin, and A. of Chester county, are 
 both rig-ht as to the plan for the destruction of this 
 pest to the farmer, and let me confirm their state- 
 ments by saying- that nothing but starvation will 
 drive them from the premises, one years' stacking 
 out is sufficient, if at a considerable distance from 
 the barns. 

Mr. M. recommends "before putting the hay in 
 the barn, that it should be swept clean, in order to 
 disturb the weevils as much as possible." This is 
 entirely useless as regards the weevil, but is never- 
 theless commendable as regards cleanliness, and 
 weevil or no weevil, should be attended to by every 
 farmer who has the least ambition to see his farm 
 buildings in proper order. 

Mr. A. says, " there are various ways of prevent- 
 ing them from eating the grain after it is thrashed ; 
 the best (he believes) is to sprinkle dry slacked lime 
 among it, as it is placed in the garner." I at one 
 time had some seed wheat infested by them, which I 
 soaked in strong brine for six hours, then spread it 
 on the barn-floor to dry; next morning found the 
 wheat alive with weevils. I then sifted air-slacked 
 lime over the heap and mixed all together. The dis- 
 turbance caused them to leave in a hurry. af\er the 

grain remained quiet for a few hours, however, they 
 went to work again as if nothtng had happened. I 
 then took the grain to the field and sowed it without 
 loss of time. 

The fact is, by stacking the grain for one season, 
 until all fermentation is over, say some six or eight 
 weeks after harvest ; you may then take it to the 
 barn, and should their be any "old residenters" 
 lurking about the crevices, they may live on it for a 
 while, but are incapable of breeding, and as the old 
 generation dies away annually, there are none lefl 
 to take their place. 

It is the fermentation of the grain and straw which 
 takes place in the mow soon after housing, that 
 hatches out the young broods. If the old stock can 
 get no access to the grain to lay their eggs previous 
 to this heating of the grain in the mow or stack, 
 " their occupation's gone." J. B. Garber,

 Experiments in Potato Culture. 

On a piece of land which had been turned in the 
 fall of 1850, and manured and ploughed in April 
 1851, thirteen plots each containing ten square rods, 
 the soil of which was of similar character and quali- 
 ty, were measured off, and on the 29th of May plant- 
 ed with forty pounds each of potatoes, nearly alike 
 in size and all of the same kind. The potatoes came 
 up well, were first harrowed and afterwards cultiva- 
 ted with the hoe, and moderately hilled. When they 
 came into blossom, a series of experiments was com- 
 menced by mowing off the stalks on one sett of the 
 plots in succession, and taking up in order the crop 
 produced on' a corresponding series on which the 
 stalks had not been mown, so as ultimately to ascer- 
 tain the comparative yield, and of course the benefit 
 or injury resulting from a removal of the stalks pri- 
 or to the ripening and harvesting of the crop at the 
 usual period. 

On the 15th of October the crop produced by plot 
 No. 13, on which the stalks had not been mowed, 
 was taken up ; as also thut produced by the several 
 plots from which the stalks had been removed at the 
 different periods stated above. The following was 
 the result.
