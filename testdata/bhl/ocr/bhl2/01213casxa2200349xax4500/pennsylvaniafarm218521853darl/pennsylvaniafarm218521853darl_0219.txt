On those plots on which the potatoes were taken 

up at the time when the stalks were mowed off on 

corresponding plots, the following difference of yield 

resulted : 

No. 4, produced 57 pounds more than No. 2 

- - 338 pounds. 

- - 392 

- - 503 

On comparing the foregoing differences of yield, it 
 appears that whilst these were nearly the same in the 
 case of No. 3, 5, 7 and 9, the difference of product on 
 those plots on which the stalks had not been mowed 
 off, but the crops of which had been taken up at dif- 
 ferent periods, viz : Nos. 4, 6, 8 and 10, was very 
 great. On the other hand the difference of product 
 on plots Nos. 9, 11, and 13, and on Nos. 10 and 12, 
 coincide very nearly. The explanation of this may 
 perhaps be found in the fact that considerable rain 
 fell at the beginning of August, and also about the 
 beginning of September, while during the rest of the 
 period the weather was predominantly dry. This 
 may also be reason why the yield of plots Nos. 6 and 
 10 was proportionally greater than that of No. 8. — 
 The differences of yield in Nos. 5, 7 and 9, on the 
 contrary, vary less, because the stalks were removed 
 from these respectively on the 20th of August and 
 3d and 17th of September, and they consequently 
 derived less benefit from the rain. 

The difference of yields on plots Nos. 9, 11 and 
 13, correspond more nearly with those of plots Nos. 
 10 and 12, because by the middle of September the 
 stalks on the plots which had not been mowed, had 
 become withered and dry. On the comparatively 
 larger product of those plots, the rains which fell 
 about the close of September may have had some ef- 
 fect. 

The larger product of No. 1, from which the stalks 
 were mowed on the 33d of July, is explained by the 
 fact that the second growth of stalks was very vigo- 
 rous and abundant. 

As the crop of plot No. 2, which was taken up on 
 the 23d of July, weighed only 16 pounds, it may be 
 assumed that the other plots would have yielded an 
 equal crop, if it had been taken up at that time. The 
 increase therefore, from July 23d to October 15, on 
 those plots, from which the stalks were removed at 
 different periods, is as follows : 

On No. 1, mowed July 23, - - 354 pounds.

" 7, " Sept. 3, - - 301 

9, " " 17, 

" 11, " Oct. 1, 
 " 13, not mowed, - - 

A similar series of experiments instituted in 1847, 

resulted as follows : The crop of plot No 2, taken up 

in July 23, was 49 pounds ; and the average from 

July 23, to October 15, on those plots from which 

the stalks were removed at different periods, were as 

follows : 

On No. 1, mowed July 23, 

2, " Aug. 6, 

5, " " 20, 

7, " Sept. 3, 

8, " " 17, 
 " 11, " Oct. 1, 
 " not mowed, 517 " 

The two experiments demonstrate the highly in- 
 jurious effects on the crop of a removal of the stalks 
 prior to ripening, even though it take place but two 
 weeks before harvesting. They furthermore show 
 the importance of the stalks to the growth of the 
 crop, since, both in 1847 and in 1851, plot No. 1, 
 yielded a much larger produce than the plots next 
 in order, because the second growth had more time 
 to become developed — more perfectly indeed in 1851, 
 than in 1847, as the diffei-ence in yield shows. 

In 1847, No. 2 yielded 49 pounds and in 1851 only 
 16 pounds, but aa in the latter year the season was 
 unfavorable the planting took two weeks later — a 
 disadvantage which was not overcome during the 
 rest of the season, for plot No. 13 yielded 563 pounds 
 in 1847, and only 519 pounds in 1851. The same 
 kind of potatoes was used in both experiments. 

Q,ueries. 

Mr. Editor : — In your last number I noticed in a 
 note, appended to Judge Wat.'s article on " Smut 
 in Wheat," a singular anti-smut influence exerted 
 by a cedar tree. You have asked your correspon- 
 dents for an explanation. Will they not be kind 
 enough, to explain also the singular smut influence 
 attributed to the Barl>erry bush ? I would also be 
 happy to learn upon what principle, the soaking of 
 turnip seeds in fish oil will prevent the attacks of 
 the turnip fly ? Docs the seed become so thoroughly 
 saturated with it, and does it take up such a quanti- 
 ty, as to impregnate the leaves, and thus render 
 them distasteful to the fly ? It would give not only 
 myself, but my neighbors, also, sincere pleasure to 
 have these little mysteries elucidated ; because they 
 bear upon their face the impress of humbug, especi- 
 ally the latter. It requires stronger faith than I am 
 possessed of, to believe that the saturation of so mi- 
 nute a seed as that of the turnip with any particular 
 oil, would have the effect attributed to it by the per- 
 son who recommends the plan. That oils are gener- 
 ally unpleasant to insect, is well known. Would it 
 not then be as well to sprinkle a small quantity on 
 the turnip patch before or after sowing.
