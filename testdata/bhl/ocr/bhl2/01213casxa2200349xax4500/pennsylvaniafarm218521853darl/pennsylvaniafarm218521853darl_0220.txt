Use of the Roller. 

Mr. Editor : — There appears to be a less thorough 
 appreciation of the value of the roller, for agricultu- 
 ral purposes, than almost any other implement in 
 use. This israthcr remarkable, from the fact thatevery 
 well infurmed farmer knows that it is almost indis- 
 pensable to a system of complete tillage. I am, how 
 ever, pleased to observe that for some time past, our 
 agricultural publications have been pressing its im-. 
 portanco upon the attention of their readers. When 
 the use of the roller is properly understood, i* 
 appears to me that no man who lays claim to the 
 title of farmer, should or would be without one. 

To many persons the idea of drawing a heavy 
 roller over newly sown ground, carries with it the 
 impression that its effects must prove detrimental. — 
 This lalse impression has its origin in the fact that 
 the great object to be accomplished by plowing, is 
 the thorough loosening of the soil, and that after 
 having broken up the ground, it is folly to turn round 
 and press it down again. Let us, however, look for 
 one moment, at the advantages which reflection 
 ought and experience certainly will accord to the 
 roller ; and here permit me to state my mode of using 
 it. 

Immediately after plowing, and preparatory to 
 seeding or planting, I invariably use the roller. This 
 is done for the purpose of crushing those clods which 
 in a stiff soil, and especially in a dry season, present 
 such formidable obstacles to the harrow. The har- 
 rowing, which follows, is not only more effective, but 
 decidedly easier of accomplishment, as the large 
 clods are generally broken by it, and the fragments 
 pressed into the mellow soil, where they are more 
 readily and effectively operated upon by the teeth 
 of the harrow. It may, however, be said that in 
 lighter soils, this necessity for the use of the roller 
 before harrowing would not exist. It would not be 
 to so great an extent before the first harrowing, but 
 it certainly would after the last. 

Again, I use the roller after the seed has been har. 
 rowed in or drilled, (I seed with the drill,) for the 
 purpose of pressing the earth more firmly around the 
 seed. My own impression is, that if the roller were 
 used to obliterate the small drills made by the teeth 
 of the harrow before sowing, much greater regulari- 
 ty in the distribution of the seed would be obtained. 
 (This of course presupposes broad-cast seeding) 

Let any farmer who doubts the advantages arising 
 from the use of the roller, try a simple experiment, 
 and if the result does not justify its further use, 
 then let it be set aside as worthless and expensive. 
 Set apart two strips of land of equal size. Roll the 
 one before the first harrowing, and after the last.— 
 Seed the second in the usual way, by merely harrow- 
 ing. It is not material whether the seeding is done 
 with a drill, or by broad-casting. And, my word for 
 it, he will find that his seed in the rolled strip will 

germinate more regularly, more rapidly, — the plants 
 will be more thrifty — will withstand the effects of 
 frosts better, and produce a better crop than the 
 other. 

On light soils it is of the greatest service in giving 
 more tenacity than they naturally possess. Other 
 advantages have been claimed for it : such as press- 
 ing into the soil the roots of plants which have been 
 detached in part by the action of the frost. I have 
 not the slightest doubt that such a method would be 
 beneficial, although I have never tried it. Another 
 advantage is the crushing of insects which injure 
 the growing plant. To accomplish this, I under- 
 stand that the farmers in several parts of Europe 
 roll their fields after nightfall, as these pests then 
 make their appearance on the surface of the ground. 
 It might be tried with great advantage with us also.

NATURAL HISTORY OF THE CHERRY. 

The following interesting facts in the Natural His- 
 tory of the Cherry, we copy from an old English Hor- 
 ticultural publication. 

It is thought the Cherry was procured and brought 
 into Europe by Lucullus, a Roman General, who 
 drove Mithidrates, king of Pontus, from his domin- 
 ions. The tree was found growing in Cerasus (Ker- 
 esoun) a city of Pontus, which his army destroyed. 
 This circumstance is supposed to be the origin of the 
 name of the fruit, Cerasus. Both Mithidrates and 
 Lucullus appear to have been botanists, and although 
 the former vanquished twenty-four nations, and learn- 
 ed to speak their different languages, with ease and 
 fluency, yet he found time to write a treatise on bot- 
 any in the Greek language. Lucullus is said to have 
 planted the cherry in Italy 68 years before the Chris- 
 tian era; at the end of twenty-six years from that 
 time their culture had become general on the Conti- 
 nent, and they had even extended as far as Britain' 
 this makes its introduction 42 years before the chris- 
 tian era, although it is believed by many to have on- 
 ly been planted here in the time of New's reign, which 
 was A. D. 55. And about A. D. 70, Pliny wrote his 
 work on Natural History, and mentions eight differ- 
 ent kinds as being cultivated in Italy. 

Kent has long been celebrated for the quantity of 
 cherries it produces, and it appears probable that in 
 this part of England the trees were first planted. It 
 was supposed that during the Saxon period, the whole 
 race of cherries brought to this country by the Ro- 
 mans were wholly lost, and, during the reign of Hen- 
 ry VIII. they were re-introduced from Flanders, but 
 the writings of Gerarde seems to prove they were not 
 wholly lost, for he says, "the Flanders cherrie differ- 
 eth not from our English cherrie," &c. 

The cherry seems to have been an highly esteemed 
 fruit by the court, in the time of Charles the first, as
