takes in water without flooding in time of rain, and 
 gives it off again gradually in the time of drouth. 

3. By preventing adhesion and assisting in pulve- 
 rization, it allows the roots to pass freely through 
 all parts of the soil. 

4. By facilitating the mixture of manure through 
 the pulverized portions, it greatly increases its value 
 and effect. 

5. It allows water falling on the surface to pass 
 downward, carrying Avith it fertilizing substances, 
 (as carbonic acid nnd ammona,) until they are ar- 
 rested by the absorption of the soil. 

G. It abstracts in a similar manner the heat con- 
 tained in falling rains, thus warming the soil, the 
 water discharged by drain-mouths being many degrees 
 colder than by ordinary rains. 

7. The increased porosity of the soil renders it a 
 more perfect non-conductor of heat, and the roots of 
 plants are less injured bj freezing in winter. 

8. The same cause admits the entrance of air, fa- 
 cilitating the decomposition of enriching portions of 
 the soil. 

9. By admitting early plowing, crops may be sown 
 early, and increased amount reaped in consequence. 

10. It economizes labor, by allowingthework to go 
 on at all times, without interruption from surplus 
 water in spring, or from a hard baked soil in sum-

Bob's Notion of Botik P'arming. 

Bob, the farmer's son, thus expresses himself of 
 an improved system of farming, in the Indiana Far- 
 mer : 

Editors Farmer : — I have only to say to you that 
 I wish you Avould keep your agricultural paper to 
 yourselves, and away from our house. Since the old 
 man has been taking it, there is " no rest to the wick- 
 ed," certain. lie keeps ns hauling muck (as he calls 
 it,) manure, old ashes, and even makes us clean out 
 out the pig pen, and put the filth on our fields. For- 
 merly there was some mercy shown the horses, for 
 we plowed only three inches deep, but now, nothing 
 less than ten inches will do, and the corn ground is 
 to be plowed below that with a new plow he has just 
 bought. 

Tjie next thing, I think, will be to take the bottom out 
 of the well ! We used to take the Palladium, and he 
 v^ould suck down the politics contained in it as gos- 
 pel truths, and had plenty of time to spend half a 
 day, and time to talk about who should be elected, 
 .and who should not. But he don't read that paper 
 now, and he is as anxious to get the Farmer, as he 
 was formerly to have the election day come round. — 
 lie is all the time talkingaboutnew " fertilizers," &c. 
 He don't only talk either, but he makes us boys hoe 
 it from morning till night. We have had to tear 
 down all the fences, and re-set them, and he has got 
 the old lady in the notion of white-washing the gar- 
 den fence. ' What foolishness ! and the plague of it 
 is, we boys will have it to do — just wasting the time 
 we might spend in fishing. So keep your paper to 
 yourselves, and we will have some rest again. 

Importation of Eggs into England. — From the 
 returns prepared by the Englisli Board of Trade, it 
 is stated that during the five months ending- the 5th 
 of June, 52,338,676 eggs were imported and entered 
 for home consumption. Of these two-thirds went to 
 supply the London markets. The average monthly 
 consumption of foreign eggs is 15,000.000. The 
 importation of butter during the first five months of 
 the present year, were 117,797 cwts. against 129,926 
 in the corresponding period of time last year. —

AGEICTJLTURAL FAIR. 

To THE Farmers of Pennsylvania and the 
 Neighboring States. — The first Exhibition of the 
 Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society afforded 
 satisfactory evidence that it is not difficult to deve- 
 lope the resources of our State, for so interesting an 
 occasion. The exhibition itself, the pleasure we 
 derived from it, and its profitable effects, in the face 
 of the doubts and fears which always bear heavily 
 upon new projects, were beyond our reasonable ex- 
 pectations. Now, that we know what can be done, 
 we propose to hold our Second Annual Exhibition 
 at Lancaster, on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, 
 the 20th, 21st, and 22d of October, 1852, to which 
 we invite all persons, everywhere, who feel an inte- 
 rest in the subject. We have made arrangements 
 for the most ample accommodations and care of all 
 the animals, products and machinery which shall be 
 brought there ; and we trust every Farmer, Horti- 
 culturist, Manufacturer, Mechanic, and Inventor, 
 will partake Avith us, and consider himself as one 
 engaged in the work of making this great Exhibition 
 as interesting and profitable, as is our design it 
 should be. 

Our Society especially desires to recognize the 
 influence and power that mothers and daughters 
 may exert in promoting our objects, and we there- 
 fore cordially invite them to our meeting, and solicit 
 the contributions of their taste and industry to give 
 beauty and interest to our Exhibition.

New Subscriptions. — It affords us sincere plea- 
 sure to state that our fall campaign has opened most 
 auspiciously. Our subscription list has been largely 
 increased during the past month, for which we are 
 indebted to a number of kind friends who have been 
 instrumental in getting up clubs; and to the activi- 
 ty of our agents in Centre, Cumberland and Chester 
 counties. Keep the ball rolling good friends. 

Reports of County Exhibitions. 

Will not the Secretaries of the different County 
 Societies, that purpose holding exhibitions during the 
 fall, favor us with brief accounts of them, or prevail 
 upon some of their friends to do so. We shall be 
 largely indebted to any person who may comply with 
 our request. 

Horticultural Exhibition at Pittsburg. — The 
 annual exhibition of the Pittsburg Horticultural So- 
 ciety, was held in that city on the 23d of Sept., and 
 is said to have been far superior to the horticultural 
 display at Cleveland. 

New York State Fair. — This great affair came 
 off on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of Sept. Although the
