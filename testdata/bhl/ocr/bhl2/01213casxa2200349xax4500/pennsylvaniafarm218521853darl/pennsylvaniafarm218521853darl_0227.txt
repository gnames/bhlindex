EUtOGIUM OX THE LATE A. J. DOWNING 

Pronounced before the Pomological Congress at Phila-^ 
 delplda, Sept., 13, 1852. 

BY HON. MARSHALL P. WILDER. 

The annual return of the 28th of July vrill moisten 
 the eyes and agonize the hearts of many Amei'ican 
 citizens. 

On the morning of that disastrous day two steam- 
 ers, the Armenia and Ilenrv Clay, with numerous 
 passengers on boa^d, start from the capitol for the 
 chief commercial port of the Empire fetate. Like 
 "stately sailing swans" they glide swiftly over the 
 smooth surface of the Hudson. The fire within them 
 waxes warm ; their awful energies are roused ; they 
 run abreast — anon, the "bird of the west" darts 
 ahead and distances her orient rival. She calls at 
 her landings, swells the number of her passengers, 
 ami with fearful velocity bears them onward. 

They admire the varied landscapes, the cottages, 
 villas, towns, cities, bold cliffs and lofty mountains, 
 which have given the scenery about this majestic 
 river a world-wide renown. 

They near a city which rises in beauty and grace, 
 from its western bank back to the brow of the dis- 
 tant hill. There, is a 

" Cottage, half embowered 
 With modest jessamine, and there a spot 
 Of garden ground, where, ranged in neat array. 
 Grow countless sweets." 

Its architecture is in the most approved Eliza- 
 bethan style. Its grounds are tastefully laid out 
 and adorned, and he who named it " Highland Gai-- 
 dens" accurately translated the natural language of 
 the place. It overlooks the city and the river, and 
 commands a view of one of the most extensive and 
 beautiful landscapes in the world. The very site 
 seems designed by nature for the birth-place of ge- 
 nius, and for the abode of comfort, taste and learning. 

Its proprietor, with his relatives and friends, six 
 in all, take passage in the ill-fated boat. She bears 
 them on toward their port of destination, when sud- 
 denly the alarm of fire rings like a death knell 
 through that floating sepulchre. The passengers 
 are ordered aft, and she is headed for the eastern 
 shore. In a moment all is consternation and horror, 
 which no language can describe, no painter's pencil 
 sketch. Her whole centre is on fire. She strikes 
 the bank two miles below the town of Yonkers. Tiie 
 wind envelopes the multitude on her stern in smoke 
 and flame. AVith a fearful odds in the chances of 
 escape, the Great Destroyer offers them their choice 
 between a di^ath by flami^ or a death by flood. Alas ! 
 on some he inflicts both — they arc first burned and 
 then drowned ! 

They are driven before the devouring clement, and 

entrust themselves to the mercy of the waves. Amidst 
 the crowd at the stern, stands a man of tall and 
 slender habit, and of thoughtful expression, whose 
 penetrating eye surveys this perilous scene, and seeks 
 the most favorable chance of escape. His accustom- 
 ed self-possession fails him not in this awful extremi- 
 ty. He imparts wise counsels for personal preserva- 
 tion to his friends and those about him ; then climbs 
 to the upper deck for articles from the furniture of 
 the boat, on Avhich they may float to the shore. He 
 returns, but his beloyed wife and part of his compa- 
 ny have already been driven overboard. He connnits 
 the rest, and last of all himself, also, to the fatal 
 flood. 

" Forlorn of heart, and by severe decree 
 Compelled reluctant to the faithless sea." 
 They sink ; they rise. With the grasp of death they 
 cling to him and again submerge him and themselves 
 in the waves. He brings them once more to the sur- 
 face and beats for the shore. Alas ! it is vain; his ef- 
 forts to save others peril his own life. Entangled, 
 exhausted, disabled, he sinks to a Avatery grave! 

But the partner of his life, her sister and brother, 
 who were mercifully rescued from the jaws of death, 
 are still unapprized of his melancholy fate, and 
 search for him in vain among the agonized survivors. 
 But the cry, she sinks ! she sinks ! ! fills their liearts 
 with direful apprehensions. Still they cling to the 
 delusive hope that ho may be among those rescued 
 liy the rival Armenia, and borne to the city of New 
 York. 

The object of his conjugal love returns to her deso- 
 olate homo. The tidings of this awful disaster fly 
 upon the wings of the wind ; the mystic wires trem- 
 ble at the shock; the press utters its loud lament; 
 the note of woe rings through our streets, tills our 
 dwellings, and convulses our hearts with grief. The 
 nation mourns — minute guns are fired upon the spot, 
 to arouse the inhabitants of the surrounding country 
 and to start the dead from their lowly rest. Multi- 
 tudes rush from every quarter to the mournful 
 scene ; they crowd around each body as it is raised 
 and brought to the shore, to indentify therein a rela- 
 tion or friend. Among them his brother and partr 
 ner in business arrive. At length, another body is 
 raised. Its countenance is recognized ; and the dole- 
 ful announcement is made that Andrew Jackson 
 Downing is no more. 

" Lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay." 

His precious remains are borne back to their native 
 city, and to his house of mourning. Tliere, they 
 meet his widowed wife, whose ear, during the four- 
 teen years of their Avedded life, had Ijcen so quick to 
 catch the sound of his returning footsteps, and who 
 had been the first to greet and welcome him. Alas ! 
 she is suddenly bereft, by one fatal blow, of friend, 
 mother and husband 1 The funeral rites are per- 
 formed ; his body is committed to the tomb, " earth 
 to eartli," " ashes to aslu's," " dust to dust !" 

Thus terminated theearliily career of our lament- 
 ed brother and associate. But his name shall be per- 
 petuated by fragrant flowers and didicous fruits ; by 
 gushing fountains and murmuring streams ; by grate- 
 ful shade and balmy ])rce'ze, and by many a rural 
 scone, and many a tastoHl home. He shall be ro 
 mcmbered 

" Where cottages, and fanes, and villas rise ; 

Where cultur'd fields and gardens smile around." 

But to bo specific, the results of his toil appear in 

the forests which he lias preserved from the niercilcsa 

axe — in the trees which ho has descrihcd ami maJa 

to contribute more abundantly to the taste and com-
