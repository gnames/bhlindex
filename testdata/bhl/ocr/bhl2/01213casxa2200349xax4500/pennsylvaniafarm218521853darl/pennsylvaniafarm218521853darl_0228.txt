(HE LATE A. J. DOWNING. 

[October, 

fort of their propriotors — in the avenues which he has 
 adorned — in the hawns and pknisure grounds which 
 he has hiid out and appropriately emb(>llisiicd — and 
 in num])erless buildings which stand as monuments 
 to his architectural skill. 

The fruits of his labors are also gathered in thou- 
 sands of gardens and conservatories. The numerous 
 cottages and villas which have lately sprung up in 
 the towns and villages about our oommorcial cites, 
 and throughout our happy land evince his genius ; 
 and it is due to his worth to say, that few have left a 
 mark so deep and broad on the generation in which 
 they lived. 

In responding to the calls which have been made 
 upon me to pronounce the eulogy of our deceased 
 friend, I shall attempt nothing more, and can cer- 
 tainly do nothing better, than to articulate the lan- 
 guage ot his useful life, and to give free utterance to 
 your own convictions of bis worth. 

Mr. Downing w^as born in Newburgh, N. Y., on 
 the thirty-first day of October, A. D., 1815. In his 
 boyhood he manifested a fondness for botany, miner- 
 ology, and other natural sciences, which at the age 
 of sixteen, when he left school, he was able to prose- 
 cute without the aid of an instructor. At that period, 
 his father having died when he was but seven years 
 of age, his mother desired him to become a clerk in 
 a dry good store ; but he, following the native ten- 
 dencies of his mind, preferred to remain with his el- 
 der brother in the nursery and garden, whose accura- 
 cy and practical skill in horticulture gave special 
 prominence to the same traits in the deceased, and 
 with whom he might study the theory, and perfect 
 himself in the practice of his favorite arts. 

In the formation of his character, we also recog- 
 nize with gratitude the agency of Baron de Lidreer, 
 the Austrian Consul, whose summer residence was 
 in his native place, a gentleman of large endowments 
 and attainments, of eminent purity of mind, and re- 
 finement of manners, a minerologist, and botanist, 
 who discovered in young Downing a mind of kindred 
 taste, who made him the frequent inmate of his fam- 
 ily, as well as his own companion in numerous ex- 
 cursions for the scientific exploration of th e sur- 
 rounding country. 

But his sensibility to artistic beauty was cultivated 
 and developed by the lamented Kaphael Iloyle, an 
 English artist, residing in Newburg, and who, like 
 himself, went down to an early grave, leaving behind 
 him specimens in landscape paintings, true to nature, 
 and of remarkable delicacy of colouring. His man- 
 ners were much improved and adorned by his famil- 
 iar intercourse with his neighbor, JNIr. Edward Arm- 
 strong, a gentleman of refinement and wealth, at 
 whose fine country seat on the Hudson he was intro- 
 duced to the Hon. Charles Augustus Murray, an 
 Englishman, whose book of travels in America has 
 been admired on both sides of the Atlantic. There 
 he also made the acquaintance of many other distin- 
 guished men, who subsequently became his corres- 
 pondents and personal friends. 

These associations had, no doubt, much influence 
 in strengthening his refined and generous nature. — 
 He devoted all the time he could reclaim from physi- 
 cal labor to reading and study. In the bowers of his 
 garden he held frequent converse with the muses, 
 who inspired him with the poetic fire which illumes 
 his pages, and imparts peculiar vivacity and energy 
 to his style. 

At the age of 22, on the seventh of June, 1838, he 
 married Miss Caroling Elizabeth, daughter of J. P. 
 De Wint,_Esq., of Fishkill Landing, a lady of conge- 
 nial spirit, of refinement and intelligence, to whom 

the world is much indebted for his usefulness. In 
 grateful return for her valuable services, she now 
 enjoys the commiseration andcondolence of liis friends 
 in America and trans-atlantic countries. But with 
 all these aids, still 3Ir. Downing was, in the strictest 
 sense, seJf-tauyht ; a fact which deserves to be recor- 
 ded, not only to his praise, but as an encouragement 
 to thousands of aspiring youth. If he was never a 
 pupil in the studio of an artist ; if he studied natural 
 science in the laboratory of nature more than in the 
 schools of scientific chemists ; if he enjoyed not the 
 advantages of a liberal and professional education, 
 valuable and desirable as these means of improve- 
 ment certainly are ; yet he was at all times and every 
 where a learner ; and the lessons of wisdom which 
 he received, he promptly reduced to practice ; a cir- 
 cumstance which made him eminently practical and 
 national, a man of his own age and country. 

I will illustrate his habits of observation and study. 
 In a walk he plucks from an overhanging bough a 
 single leaf, examines its color, form and structure ; 
 inspects it with his microscope, and having recorded 
 his observations, presents it to his friend, and invites 
 him to study it, as suggestive of some of the first 
 principles of Rural Architecture and Economy. 

Does he visit a beautiful country seat, he sketches 
 a view of it, and of the grounds about it; notes 
 whatever is true to nature, accurate in taste, or ex- 
 cellent in design ; and from his copy, a pla;e is en- 
 graved, and in the next number of his Horticulturist 
 the Avhole scene, with his valuable comments, is given 
 to the lovers of the landscape and the garden. 

He returns from the forest. A short extract from 
 his journal will explain the object of his tour, and 
 afford a fair specimen of the beauty and forco of his 
 style : 

"Natura plants some trees, like the fir and the 
 pine, in the fissures of the rock, and on the edge of 
 the precipice ; she twists their boughs, and gnarls 
 their stems, by storms and tempests — thereby adding 
 to their picturesque power in sublime and grand 
 scenery. But she more often developes the beautiful 
 in a tree of any kind, in a genial soil and clime, 
 where it stands quite alone, stretching its boughs 
 upward freely to the sky, and outward to the breeze, 
 and even downward to the earth, almost touching 
 her in her graceful sweep, till only a glimpse of the 
 fine trunk is to be seen at its spreading base, and 
 the whole top is one great globe of floating and wav- 
 ing luxuriance, giving us as perfect an idea of sym- 
 metry and proportion as can be found short of the 
 (Jrecian Apollo." "One would no more wish to 
 touch it with the pruning knife, the axe, or the saw, 
 (unless to remove a decayed branch) than to give a 
 nicer curve to the rainbow, or to add freshness to the 
 dew-drop." This description, for beauty, power of 
 diction, and for truthfulnees to nature, not only har- 
 monizes with the pictures, but even rivals the finest 
 touches of the pencils of Claude, Poussin, Salvator 
 Rosa, or any other great master of landscape. 

He makes the tour of New England, and stops at 
 New Haven, that city of elms. He walks out from 
 the Tontine upon the green, admires those grateful 
 shades, their majestic lorm their gracefully waving 
 boughs, and they revive in his mind the history of 
 the elm, its varied use for fuel, t'anler and shade. — 
 He arrives at Hartford. The first object of his at- 
 tention is the " charter oak." He hastens to visit 
 it, stands before it, and filled with veneration, ex- 
 claims, with the bard of Mantua, translated by 
 Dryden, 

" Jove's own tree, 
 That holds the world in sove;eigatj l"
