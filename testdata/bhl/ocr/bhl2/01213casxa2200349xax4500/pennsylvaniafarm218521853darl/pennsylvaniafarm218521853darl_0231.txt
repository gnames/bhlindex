ored engravings. It has passed through thirteen 
 editions, and originally combined his personal obser- 
 vation and experience with those oi other American 
 fruit growers down to that date. 

Besides these productions of his pen, he edited, 
 with notes and emendations, " Mrs. Loudon's Garden- 
 ing for Ladies," also, " Lindley's Theory of Horticul- 
 ture," delivered various addresses ; submitted reports 
 to public bodies, and contributed numerous articles 
 to the secular, literary and scientific journals of his 
 day. 

In addition to these labors, he rendered efficient 
 services to the cause of agriculture and agricultural 
 education. He constantly superintended his home- 
 stead — was a corresponding or acting member in 
 many horticultural and kindred associations — was 
 influential and prominent in the establishment of 
 this Congress, and from its origin, chairman of its 
 fruit committee — the author of the rules of " Ameri- 
 can Pomology," which, with some modications, have 
 been extensively adopted. He advised and aided in 
 the laying out of grounds, in the plans and specifica- 
 tions of various private and public buildings, and at 
 the time of his death, not only had contracts for im- 
 portant professional services in Newburg, Newport, 
 Georgetown, Albany, Boston, and other places, but 
 was actually on his way to Washington to prosecute 
 the business in which he had engaged by the nation- 
 al government, for the laying out and adornment of 
 the public grounds in that city. He had also pro- 
 jected several new volumes in the departments of 
 his peculiar studies and labors, as well as the revi- 
 sion of his present Avorks. The last effort of his pen 
 was a postscript to a set of working plans to illus- 
 trate a design for an observatory, proposed to be 
 erected in one of our principal cities. 

Alas ! that one so eminently useful, with such bril- 
 liant prospects before him, and Avhose place it is so 
 difficult to fill, should be so suddenly removed ! Such 
 is the common exclamation ! But this general sorrow 
 may find consolation in his own devout words, in a 
 letter of condolence addressed to me but a few days 
 before his death. They seem prophetic of this hour. 
 " God knows what is best for us." 

This dispensation is indeed mysterious ; a wonder 
 of Providence such as the All-Wise and Infinite rare- 
 ty permits. He takes away one to whom we are most 
 attached, and that, too, when we can least afford to 
 spare him. But let us hope that this melancholy 
 event may awaken public attention, and direct it 
 from the man to his pursuits and to their connection 
 with the public welfare, and thus become the occa- 
 sion of raising up a host to carry out and consum- 
 mate his worthy enterprise. 

We have thus spoken of the last hours of our la- 
 mented friend — of the dreadful catastophre -nhich 
 terminated his earthly career — of the circumstances 
 and influences in which his character was formed — 
 of the great events of his public life — of his publish- 
 ed works — and of his plans of future usefulness. 

As your humble servant, appointed to speak of his 
 " life, character and virtues," it is not proper for me 
 to indulge personal and private partiality. It has 
 been my endeavor to form such an enliglitened judg- 
 ment of his worth, and such an unbiased estimate of 
 his numerous excellencies, as shall bo in harmony 
 with your own opinion, and shall command public 
 confidence and respect. 

To speak of his faults, if he had any, was neither 
 our intention nor our duty. Frailties are incident to 
 human nature ; but happy is it for us all that com- 
 mon ])enevolcnce spreads the veil of charity over the 
 grave, and hides these in its sacred trust from pub- 

lic observation. It is the province of the eulogist to 
 speak of what was worthy of honor and imitation in 
 the departed, and of what may also comfort and con- 
 sole the hearts of the bereaved. This we have en- 
 deavored to do without exaggeration and without 
 abatement. The duty we perform is without any 
 expectation of adding to the lustre of his fame. His 
 works are his best eulogy ; the most enduring mon- 
 uments af his worth. 

But he has gone ! His seat in this Congress is va- 
 cant ! Another will make the report which was ex- 
 pected from him ! We shall much miss iiis wise and 
 leading counsels in our deliberations and discussions, 
 his prompt and energetic action in our endeavors to 
 advance the worthy olyects of this association, in the 
 origin and progress of which his agency was so con- 
 spicuous, lie has gone ! He is numbered with those 
 patrons and promoters of the ornamental and useful 
 arts, who rest from their labors ;■ — ^with the erudite 
 and sage Pickering, the wise and laborious Buel, the 
 ardent and scientific Mease, the humorous and poetic 
 Fessenden, the practical and enterprising Lowell, the 
 tasteful and enthusiastic Dearborn, the indefatigable 
 and versatile Skinner, the scientific and voluminous 
 Loudon, and others of noble designs and of enduring 
 fame. These have fallen around us like the leaves 
 of autumn ; and Providence now calls upon us to in- 
 scribe on that star-spangled roll the cherished name 
 of Downing, struck down suddenly, when his sun 
 was at the zenith of its glory. 

He rests in the bosom of his mother earth, in the 
 city of his birth and the sepulchre of his fathers, on 
 the banks of that beautiful river where his boyhood 
 sported, and where the choicest secenery inspired his 
 opening mind with the love of nature — a spot which 
 will be dear to the thousands of his pdmirers, and 
 which our love for him will constrain us to visit. — 
 We may resort to his hospitable mansion, but he will 
 no longer greet us with his cordial salutation, nor 
 extend to us the right hand of fello .ship. AYe may 
 wend our way through his beautiful grounds ; but he 
 will not be there to accompany us. Instead of his 
 pleasant and instructive voice, which once dropped 
 words of wisdom and delight on our ear, we shall 
 hear the t.ees mournfully sighing in the breeze — the 
 cypress moaning his funeral dirge, and the willow 
 weeping in responsive grief, " because he is not." — 
 " His mortal has put on immortality." 

When we think of the place which he occupied in 
 the hearts of his countrymen and cotemporaries — of 
 the expanding interest which he has awakened in the 
 rural arts, the refinements and comforts of society — 
 of his unfinished y)lans, which others, inspired by his 
 genius, will unfold and consummate — and of his 
 works, which will be admired when the tongues that 
 now praise him shall be silent in death, our sense of 
 justice accords to him an earthly immortality — a 
 fame which history will cherish, art adorn, and grate- 
 ful posterity' revere. 

lie is dead ; yet how little of siicli men can perish ! 
 The clayey tenement may indeed fall and crumble, 
 but to him who dwelt in it, a place is assigned in the 
 firmament of American genius, far above the storms 
 and convulsions of earth — " in tliat c^ear upper sky," 
 where he shall shine forever to illumine the path of 
 intelligence, cnt(>rpriso and virtue, and henceforth to 
 enkindle in the human mind a love of order, taste 
 and beauty. We rank him with those who start im- 
 provements which advance ages after they are dead, 
 and who are justly entitled to the consideration and 
 gratitude of mankind. Washington and his illustri- 
 ous associates are dead, but the liberty which they 
 achieved still lives, and marches in triumph and
