ON TOPPING CORN. 

We gave in a former number, some remarks on 
 the cultivation of corn, and intimated our intention 
 to refer more particularly to the practice of topping 
 ihe stalks, as often practiced by farmers. We now 
 proceed to redeem that promise, as far as we are 
 able, and to suggest a few thoughts which have oc- 
 curred to us, based on our own, and the experience 
 of others. The subject deserves additional import- 
 ance the present year, on account rf the short crop 
 of hay, which urges farmers to greater economy in 
 the securing of their coarse fodder. 

In discussing this question, we may perhaps, as- 
 sume the following positions as admitted facts, for 
 we believe that their correctness is very generally 
 conceded: 1. The greatest quantity, in pounds, of 
 corn is obtained by allowing the grain to ripen on 
 the stalk. 2. The greatest yield is generally ob- 
 tained by cutting at the roots before injury from 
 frost, and curing in the shock. 3. The lightest 
 weight of grain is generally obtained by the system 
 of toppmg the stalks. 

If these fixcts are admitted, we then start with a 
 very strong argument against the practice of topping. 
 Let us see whether the system has or has not advan- 
 tages to commend it to favor, notwithstanding these 
 causes operating against it. 

The principal arguments in favor of topping are 
 that the grain is better cured as a general rule, than in 
 any other way of harvesting and is done with less labor 
 and expense. It is thought too, that the stalks saved 
 are in much better condition than when harvested in 
 any other mode, and many formers seem to place but 
 little value upon the butts, or lower part of the stalk, 
 for fodder. This opinion is, we think, a mistaken 
 one, for in our experience, we have found the butts 
 worth more for fodder than the tops, especially when 
 properly cured. 

The labor and expense of harvesting is not materi- 
 ally different, whether the stalks be topped and the 
 butts afterwards cut at the ground, or the whole crop 
 cut up at the ground at the first instance. The 
 extra labor in cutting up is generally made up in the 
 greater expedition of husking. 

The great objection of cutting at the roots before 
 frosts, is in the difficulty of curing the corn and 
 stalks properly. We are aware that many claim that 
 this IS an easy matter, but our observation goes to 
 convince us, that in one lialf the cases at least, both 
 grain and fodder is poorly cured by tliat system. 
 The fodder when well cured, is unquestionably more 
 valuable than any other mode of harvesting. 

The conclusion to which we arrive is that in cases 

where great care and attention can be bestowed upon 
 the cutting and stocking, and where the autumn is 
 not apt to be too wet, cutting by the root is the best 
 method. If this care cannot be bestowed upon the 
 crop, and if it cannot have good care in drying, some 
 other system had better be resorted to. 

We have seen large quantities of corn cut and 
 stooked, but seldom have we seen a large field saved 
 in good order. Generally the stocks fall down, the 
 rain injures them, the corn and stalks all suffer in 
 quality, and the crop turns out badly. But notwith- 
 standing all these drawbacks, we are convinced of 
 the many advantages resulting from cutting at the 
 roots. 

Of the value of corn fodder, and the importance of 
 saving all of it, too much cannot be said. It is, for 
 many purposes, superior to hay, and always pays 
 liberally for the labor and expense of securing in the 
 best manner. — iV. Y. Farmer. 

What Guano is made of. — As Guano is getting to 
 be one of the vexed questions of the day, the follow- 
 ing analysis, of out Lobos Guano, recently made in 
 London, has an interest, particularly to the agricul- 
 turist : 

Salt of Ammonia, 7^ parts. 

Animal organic matter, 8j do 

Sulphate of muriate of potash and soda, 2^ do 
 Phosphate of lime and magnesia, 52 do 

Sand, 18 do 

Water moisture, 11 J do 

Liebig says that one pound of Guana imported 
 into a country, is equal in value to eight pounds of 
 wheat, or twelve and a half cents. It was stated a 
 day or two since, that ten tons of guano at $50 per 
 ton, was worth to the farmer $600 net profit. 

Guano and Lime. — William Boulware, of Virgina, 
 has furnished the American Farmer the statement 
 of an interesting experiment, showing that guano is 
 not so evanescent in soils as it has generally been 
 believed to be. Three years ago, 50 bushel of lime 
 per acre was applied to a field of corn in spring. 
 The next autumn, two acres of this field were dressed 
 with 200 lbs. of Patagonian Guano, and the whole 
 field sown with wheat. A pait was sown Avith clover 
 the next spring. The wheat looked much the best 
 on the guanoed part during spring, but lost much of 
 its superiority in the drought of summer, the soil 
 being light. But the clover took well, and the next 
 year yielded a luxuriant crop after the guano, but on 
 other parts of the field was not worth cutting. After 
 second crop of clover, wheat was again sown, and on 
 the two guanoed acres it was one hundred per cent, 
 better than on that which was limed only, and other- 
 wise of equal fertility. 

Making Vinegar, — Vinegar, according to a writer 
 in the Genesee larmer, is cheaply made. We re- 
 publish his recipe : — 

" To eight gallons of clear rain water, add three 
 quarts of molasses; put into a good cask, shake well, 
 and add two or three spoonfuls of good yeast cakes. 
 If in summer, place the cask in the sun ; if in winter, 
 near the chimnev, where it may be warm. In ten 
 or fifteen days, add to the liquor a sheet of brown 
 paper, torn in strips, dipped in molasses, and good 
 vinegar will be produced. The paper will, in this 
 way, form what is called the ' mother,' or life of the 

vinegar.
