CORNELL'S IMPROVED SELF REGULATING 
 HORSE POWER, 

On the endless chain plan, for which letters patent 
 ■were obtained in February, 1852, is now offered to 
 the pul}lic with the assurances that it ■will be found 
 to possess advantages over all others now in use. It 
 will operate at a less grade, will give more power at 
 the SAiME GRADE, and icith less labor to the horse than 
 any other. The comparatively small elevation at 
 which this power operates efficiently, relieves that 
 ruinous amount and kind of labor which other pow- 
 ers generally impose upon horses, and it is believed 
 that its advantages in this important respect alone, 
 if it possessed no other, must give it character, and 
 bring it into very general use. But this residt is 
 further promoted by a most happy combination of 
 forces which gives to it an exceedingly light and easy 
 motion. The platform drums are large, and'the ar- 
 rangement of the whole driving apparatus upon fric- 
 tion rollers reduces the friction of the machine to 
 such a slight amount that an almost inappreciable 
 fraction of the power exerted by the horse will put 
 the whole in motion. It is therefore peculiarly adap- 
 ted for driving light machinery, where an excess of 
 speed would endanger the machinery driven ; and yet 
 the solidity and strength of the power are such that 
 it is equally well adapted to the driving of the heavi- 
 est kinds of machinery. 

But it possesses other advantages — the Power is 
 under the control of a Governor or Self-Regulator. 
 As Horse Powers are generally constructed, no effi- 
 cient means are provided for regulating the speed, or 
 guarding against accidents arising from undue 
 velocity. A portion of the machinery driven, or 
 of the Power itself, may be thrown out of gear, and 
 from this cause or some other, a greatly increased 
 velocity may be given to the remaining parts of the 
 machinery, and an increase of speed dangerous to 
 the limbs of the horse. All such difficulties are 
 entirely obviated by a Governor and Friction Brake, 
 which regulate aad control all undue velocity of the 
 Power. Cornell's Power thus constructed, regulated 
 and controlled, is singularly capable of the highest 
 execution which such machinery can attain, and 
 with safety. It is adapted to one or more horses, as 
 may be desired. 

Although but very recently produced, a large 
 numl)er of the Powers have been sold in a community 
 in which those of Wheeler, Emery & Co., and others 
 have been in use. 
 First Premium at Philadelphia County Exhibition. 

At the Exhibition of the Philadelphia County Ag- 
 ricultural Society, held at the Rising Sun, October, 
 1851, the highest premium was awarded to Cornell's 
 Power, although in competition with that of Emery 
 & Co., and others. 

The power exhibited above was new, and made 
 without reference to such public exhil)ition, but, al- 
 though subjected to the close examination of the 
 very competent gentlemen who composed the official 
 members of those associations, the result has been of 
 the most flattering kind. 

First Premium at BucJcs County Exhibition. 

Cornell's Horse Power was exhibited at the Bucks 
 County Exhibition held at Newtown, Octol)er, 1851, 
 and obtained the highest premium, although in com- 
 petition with Wheeler's and others. 

Additional information can be obtained by letter 
 as above directed, and the Power is always open to 
 inspection at the Depot, No. 156 Vine sti-eet, below 
 Fifth, Philadelphia. The Patentee is open to nego- 
 tiation for the sale of Township, County or State 
 Rights. August, 1852.— 3m.

DRILLS! DRILLS ! ! DRILLS ! ! ! 

■WE are now manufacturing the LARGEST and BEST AS- 
 SORTMENT OF SEED PLANTERS ever offered to the public ; 
 several varieties of which we have constantly on hand. Th^ se in- 
 terested are respectfully invited to call, examine and satisfy them- 
 selves of their merits. 

We have so improved and simplified our Drill, as to enable us to 
 sell it at the following reduced rates : 
 One with seven tubes and wooden Seed Roller, quantity 

regulated by Screws, gSO 00 

For each additional Tube, 7 50 

Seven Tubed do , iron Seed Rollers, regulated with screws 8,3 00 
 Each additional Tube, jo 00 

Seven Tubed do,Single Hopper, and Patent Iron Seed RoIIfts, 
 which, by the movement of a single screw, is regulated 

to seed any desired quantity per acre, 85 00 

Each additional 'I'ube, 10 00 

In addition to the foregoing, we are building a large number of 
 Slide Drills, wliich have been satisfactorily tested, and are war- 
 ranted deeidedly superior to any other Slide Drills in the market, 
 particularly in the even distribution of the Grain upon rough and 
 and hilly ground ; also in the facility and prision by which it is 
 regulated to sow any desired quantity per acre, as well as in the 
 lightness of draft, and general simplicily and durability. 
 For one of these Machines with seven Tubes, SCO 00 

'• each additioml tube, 5 00 

The above Machines are Warranted not to Cut, Break, or "Waste 
 Grain ; to be made of the best materials, in a substantial and work- 
 manlike maneer, and t.) dothe work more perfectly than any other. 

They are not liable to choke with white caps or straw, and are 
 sailed to rough and hilly, as well as smooth and level land. 

Owing to the peculiar form of our depositing tubes, they run 
 easier and free themselves from filth better than any others — 
 These Tubes are supplied with Reversible ^teel Points, either end 
 of which can be extended as they become worn. The simultane- 
 ous throwing into and out of operation of theSeed distributing and 
 depositing apparatus, (which we have patented) renders onr ma- 
 chine ciip;ible of being managed with much more ease and certain- 
 ty, particularly in seeding point and other irregular lands, than any 
 other Seed Planter. 

We also manufacture Horse-Powers and Threshers, Clover 
 Hullers, with and without Fans, Horse-Rakes, Corii-Shellers, &c- 
 Also, Steam I'ingines and Mill Work, Screw Cutting done to order ; 
 Castings of every description, of the best quality, furnished at 
 Wilmington Prices. S. & M. PENNOCK,
