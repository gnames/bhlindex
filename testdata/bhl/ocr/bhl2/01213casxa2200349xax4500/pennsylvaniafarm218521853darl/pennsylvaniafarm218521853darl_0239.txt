CHAPPELL'S iMi'ROVED FER riUZER-rSubstitute for Guano. 

Tiie BuOsuriber would call tlie attention of the Farmers of Peiin- 
 Bylvaiiiu to the cliemical compound or manure, manufactured by 
 Ijim fur the renovation of " worn-out lands," and known as 
 ••chappel's improved fertllizek." 

This article is composed of the same materials as arc found by 
 anal) SIS 111 the a,v/i of plants. It consists of a mixture (iu proper 
 propoitioiis) of £■• Phosphate of Lime and Magne>.ia, (or bones dis- 
 solved 111 tjulphunc Acid,) Sutp/iates 0/ Ammonia, Potash, Soda 
 and Lnn-t, Animal Charcoal, Silicates of Potash, Alumina and Mag- 
 nesia, and, as these constituents indicate, is intended to restore to 
 the soil all the inorganic materials abstracted by vegetation. It 
 has been ascertained that a soil contaiiiiiig a sutTicieiit quantity of 
 these salts, IS always fertile ; and their absence constitutes what 
 is called ^•Worn-out Land." The analysis of rich soils shows a 
 good supply, and pour land a dehcieiicy. 

The inorganic matter abstracted from the soil by the growth of 
 diflVreiit crops is the same, varying only in proportion ; it is there- 
 fore evident, that if we supply to the soil a sufficient quantity of 
 each material thus abstracted, we restote its fertility. 

The correctness of the above has been fully sustained by the use 
 of the Fertilizer, the last season. It has been used on poor land, 
 and tweuty-hve to twenty eight bushels of wheat obtained, with 
 a superior crop of clover. As a top-dressing oil wheat, eight bush- 
 els additional yield has been realized. On the spring crops of corn, 
 oats and ckiver, the yield has been doubled. It has been used on 
 the same field (as an experiment) with the best Peruvian Guano, 
 both oil corn and oats, and the yield has resulted in favor of the 
 Fertilizer. The most respectable reference can be given of its 
 value and eft'ects on poor lauds. 

This article having been used with such favorable results, the 
 manufacturer now oilers it to agriculturists, with the full confi- 
 dence that It will largely repay for the outlay, and that it is the 
 cheapest manure they can use. 

On very poor land, two barrels to the acre should be applied ; on 
 that in better condition, one and a half barrels. It is calculated, in 
 using two barrels, you supply to the soil sufficient salts for a rota- 
 tion. As a top-dressing, one barrel put on after a rain, or when the 
 land is wet, and in all cases near the surface and not ploughed in, 
 broad-cast and harrowed when practicable. The Ammonia in this 
 preparation is a Sulphate and therefore not volatile as in Guano; 
 the Bi-Phosphates and Sulphates being soluble, the rain dissolves 
 them, and they thus saturate the soil with prepared food, ready for 
 the nourishment of the plant ; being rich in Sulphates, they are 
 powerful absorbents of Ammonia from the atmosphere. 

One fact peculiar to this compound is that such portion as may 
 not be abstracted from the soil the first crop, remains 111 theground 
 until consumed by after vegetation One barrel of Chappell's Im- 
 proved Fertilizer contains as much Phosphate o/Limeas is contain- 
 ed in 31)0 lbs. Peruvian Guano; therefore, by the application of two 
 barrels (400 lbs ) to an acre, the ground is supplied with as much 
 phosphate of lime as If 400 lbs. best Peruvian Guano had been used, 
 and the Fertilizer is furnished at lees than half the cost. 

We add a few certificates. We could add rtliers, but this mode 
 of advertising is expensive— «/je.se should be sufficient to recommend 
 the Fertilizer to the favorable notice of all farmers, desiring to 
 improve their lands. 

The following from gentlemen of high standing, testifies to tlie 
 actii>ii of the Fertilizer, compaied with Peruvian and Patagonian 
 Guano. (From Com. T. Ap. C Jones, Washington.)

P. Stockton Chappell — Dear Sir : — 1 suppose 1 am indebted to 
 your kindness for a copy of the Baltimore Sun, of 17th March, 
 containing notice of transfer of "South Baltimore Chemical 
 Works" to you. I should have sooner acknowledged your atten- 
 tion, but was anxious to see a further development of the effects 
 of jour Fertilizer before 1 wrote. You may recollect that about 
 a year ago 1 purchased the first Fertilizer, "(a ton) with which I 
 experimented with barley and corn, at the time of planting, and on 
 wheat and grass as a top-dressing, all in compai isoii with Peruvian 
 and Patagonian Guano, at equal cost. The effect on the barley 
 was decidedly in favorof the Fertilizer beyond all question ; while 
 upon wheat, corn and grass, the dilTereiice was scarcely discerna- 
 ble on the growing crops. The ground on which the barley grew 
 last year was seeded with Florence wheat on the 3d dav of Octo- 
 ber, 1S.)1 ; the ground was in Die finest heart, 200 lbs. of Peruvian 
 puona having been ploughed in after fallowing, but before seed- 
 ing, which wis done with Pennock's drill. The last dressing of 
 guano was carefully sown broadcast transversely to the spring 
 dressing of guuno, and to the belt of the Fertilizer, through the 
 barley, which separated the Peruvian and Patagonian guano, and 
 the course of the drill crosses obliquely the belt ofabout sixty feet 
 on which the l''ertilizer was used about a year ago. 

My wheat, like most wheat of the season, is but middling ; my 
 land was ploughed very deep. and. although it is high and rolling, 
 the wheat hag suffered severely from a redundancy of moisture; 
 nevertheless, the wheat on the I'art r)n which the Fertilizer was 
 used at the tune of sowing the barley, in April, 18.31, is not only 
 higher hut strongfr, has a better color, and is in every respect more 
 proinisins than the wheat on either side of it notwithstanding the 
 double (Irefsing of guano to one of the Fertilizer. I li.ivo also ten 
 acres of corn ground in whe.Tt. on which your Fertilizer was ii-ed 
 •nd sown in comparison with Peruvian guano and repeated at the 
 lime of unving the wheat; the Fertilizer so far holds its own, and 
 •hoii'd I live ti' see it, I will give youparticiilnrs <if the harvest 

The coMcliisions to which my mind is brought by the foregoing 
 ttperiinents are: — 

First— That at an equal cost, with less labor, and far greater con- 
 venience (11 its applieatun, your Fertilizer is fully equal to the 
 average quality of Peruvian guano when first applied, and much 
 7nore durable in its effects on after crops. 

Secondly — That six hundred pounds (two barrels) of the Fertili- 
 zer, incorporated with the soil with the harrow belore seeding or 
 planting, is better than :iOO pounds of Peruvian guano, to wli ch 
 the fanner is compelled to add, with very considerable labor, one 
 and a half bushels gypsum, the cost of which will bring theguano 
 at the lowest rates, to $7.50 

Whilst cost of COO lbs. fertilizer, 6 00 

Diff"erence in favor of fertilizer, $1.50 

Very respectfully, A;c.

 P. S. Chappell — Dear Sir:— In answer to your note of this date, 
 asking for my experience in the use of your Fertilizer, 1 have but 
 time to say, that two or three years ago 1 used but two or three 
 barrels by way of experiment Last year. 1 used upwards of sev- 
 enty, and this year 1 will drop it on every liill of corn that I plant. 
 My experience of Us use on corn, in the hill, is most unquestiona- 
 bly ami decidedly favorable. Very respectfully, yours, \.c.

 P. S. Chappell, Esq.— Dear Sit— I have used your Fertilizer in 
 many ways upon both wheat and corn, with great success 

Yours, respectfully, ED^\^ W. WORTHINGTON.

To Dr. P. S. Chappell— Deav Sit: I have just returned from a 
 visit to Delaware, where I had an opportunity of observing the ef- 
 fects of your Agricultural Salts, in the production of wheat. They 
 were applied to two fields — (me of twenty acres — the other of 
 twenty-eight. The former is uniformly good— on the lattt.r,a part 
 has been damaged by the growth of blue grass, but my impression 
 is, the crop, on both, will be one-third greater than it would have 
 been without the fertilizing article. The grain has not y et been 
 threshed out, and consequently the above opini(Ui rests merely on 
 general observation of the crop immediately before harvest. Iii.t J 
 am satisfied it will not be found incorrect 1 think it very certain 
 you will have several orders for the Salts, frem tlie vicinity re- 
 ferred to. Very respectfully, 

Your friend and ob't serv't, 

HENRY V.D.JOHNS. 

Dr. Johns purchased, last fall, thirty barrels ; as he used it as 
 above on forty-nine acres, not more than 1^- barrels could have 
 been applied to the acre. 

I have used " Chappell's Fertilizer" upon potatoes with decided 
 benefit, and am now fully satisfied that it is the best and cheapest 
 manure I can use for that crop 

My first trial was alongside of stable and guano manure; the 
 Salts gave me the best and largest potatoes. Where the Salts was 
 used, the land was thin, and on a hill side ; I used about I4 bbls. 
 to the acre in the furrow, with the usual attention. My crop fully 
 came up to my expectations ; the potatoes were large, and of su 
 perior quality, and the crop fullv one-third greater than any of my 
 neighbors, win se land was much richer than the piece 01 land I 
 used for my potatoes. The same piece of land I have put down 

in wheat ; the furrows can be seen distinctly some distance off 

showing that the Fertilizer is still acting in the Soil. 

I shall use the Fertilizer this year on my potatoes, being fully 
 satisfied that it is the cheapest and best manure that I can use for 
 that crop. Several of my neighbors intend using t)ie Fertilizer 
 this year. I have paid great attention to the cultivation of potatoes 
 for the Baltimore market for many years, and from my experience 
 of two seasons with the Fertilizer, can lecommend it with confi. 
 deuce upon that crop 

I will add that I sold mv p.ntatoes at Sl,06 per bushel ; my 
 neighbors sold at 9iJc — the difference in price owing to the differ- 
 ence 111 quality. Yonrs truly, Lakki?) Yocng.

On the 20th of August, 1850, I applied l.M) lbs. of your Fertilizer 
 on a fourth of an acre of poor laii.l, that had not been farni.d for 
 forty years previous to the application of the FertiliZ' r. 1 h.id the 
 ground ploughed in April and slreued over it 10 bushels of lime- 
 and about the same of ashes and chip dirt from wood ynrd, har- 
 rowed it well with cultivator, and when I put on the S.1II8 I sinved 
 in Turnip Seed. Timothy and Clover and finished off with a brush. 
 The crops of Turnips was 70 bushels, that at 2.') cents bronsht 
 $17,50, and at the rate of S70 per acre. Lust summer ( l.'-5n the 
 crop of good hay was 1,100 lbs , or at the r.tU' of 2{ tons per acre, 
 and now (May, 1P.',2) the appi araine of the grass on the same is 
 far better than it was l.nsl year Many persons have lieeii to gee 
 this small, though satisfactory exp*'rimeiit, and are becoming con- 
 vinced of the benefits of your Fi-rtHizer.
