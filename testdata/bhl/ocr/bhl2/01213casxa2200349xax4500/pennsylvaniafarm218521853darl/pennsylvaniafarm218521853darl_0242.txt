STATE FAIR. 

The second annual Exhibition of the State Agricul- 
 tural Society, took place as announced, on the 20th, 
 21st, and 22d ult., and may be considered as eminent- 
 ly successful. Full reports of the several Commit- 
 tees will bo found in our columns. The number of 
 visiters was estimated at from 50, to GO, 000, and the 
 amount of money received for membership and ad- 
 missio n, was over $9,000. The amount received las 
 year at llarrisburg, was about 4,500. The question 
 as to the prosperous continuance of the State Society, 
 and the annual recurrence of the State Fairs, may 
 now be considered as settled. After all expenses are 
 paid, there must be a large surplus remaining to be 
 appropriated to a large increase of the number and 
 amount of premiums, by another season, and extend- 
 ing the field of competition. With the entire success, 
 both north and south of us, of these State Fairs, and 
 with the interest recently manifested at Lancaster, 
 the projectors of the State Society may congratulate 
 themselves on what they have already accomplished 
 and on the prospects for the future. We have in 
 Pennsylvania the material for making our exhibitions 
 equal to any in the Union. It only wants develop- 
 ment. Meagre as the recent one was in several de- 
 partments, we yet regard it fully satisfactory as a tri- 
 al of strength, and showing what may be done here- 
 after. Some of our counties showed the great pro- 
 gress already made in an improved and enlightened 
 system of farming, others in an equal degree, show- 
 ed the want of improvement in their stock, imple- 
 ments, and productions. It is almost incredible, the 
 distance between these two extremes, even in Penn- 
 sylvania. 
 We have not space to particularize many of the con- 
 tributions well worthy of notice; but must refer to 
 the official reports. In neat cattle, we were greatly 
 disappointed. But very few were on the ground, not 
 80 many as at some of the county exhibitions, and 
 had it not been for Philadehplia and Chester counties, 
 who forwarded some of their best stock, this depart- 
 ment would have been a burlesque. Of oxen and fat 
 cattle, Lancaster county, large, populous, and fer- 
 tile as she is, contributed iifo yoke, and One fet steer. 
 As an exception to this indifference on the part of her 
 farmers, we would refer to Isaac Landis, who show- 
 ed six excellent Durham Steers of large size, and II. 
 Mclntyre several fine animals of this breed. Ilis 
 bull and cow both evinced high breeding, and had 
 some good points. Gen. Cadwalader, of Philadel- 
 phia county,however,carried ofi'the palm in Durhams, 
 having over twenty head, several of them imported 
 and of great beauty, and comprising some of the 
 best blood now in the country; a very fine cow of 
 this breed was also exhibited by Samuel Cooper, 
 of Philadelphia county. Jas. Gowen's superior Dur- 
 ham Bull, "Rockland" wasalso on the ground, and re- 

ceived the first premium. The display of sheep, 
 though not large, was good. The pure Southdown, 
 and Cotswolds of Messrs. Worth, Clement, Hood, 
 Cadwalader and Ilerr, were deservedly admired. 
 The swine, also, had but few represen tatives, and 
 mostly from a distance. A very little exertion in 
 Lancaster county would have brought out a fine 
 display in this department, and there was no 
 excuse for the deficiency. Professor Wilkinson, of 
 Mount Airy, exhibited his celebrated Duchess sow, 
 "Old Pink," who carried off the prize, as she haa 
 done in several other States. We should have men- 
 tioned in place, that there were on the ground a few, 
 and a very few good Ayrshires, Alderneys and De- 
 vons. L. H. Twaddle, of Philadelphia, had some 
 very fine Alderney heifers, and there was, also,a very 
 fine bull of this breed exhibit ed by Aaron Clement. 
 The Horses were in considerable number, but chiefly 
 for draught, for the excellence of which the country is 
 somewhat celebrated. The most extensive display 
 of live stock was that of the poultry. The number 
 was not only large, but they were very fine. There 
 were Shanghaes and Cochin China, white and speck- 
 led Dorkings, Game Fowls, Bantums, Chittagongs, 
 Bremen and China G eese, Muscovy and other Ducks, 
 Golden Phcasants,Fancy Pigeons,&c., affording an ex- 
 cellent opportunity of comparison. Some sales were 
 made at high prices. 

The show of implements was large and excellent, 
 and included some 10 or 12 wheat drills, various pat- 
 terns of hay, straw, and fodder cutters, horse pow- 
 ers, grain fans, sausage cutters, cultivators, a great 
 variety of ploughs, combining some important im- 
 provements, and corn shellers, one of these latter, a 
 recently patented machine, came on the ground too 
 late for competition, but was rather novel in con- 
 struction, and intended to be worked by a one horsÂ© 
 power. The owner informed us it had shelled and 
 was warranted to shell 80 bushels of corn per hour. 
 We hope to have an engraving and description for 
 another number of the Journal. The corn is inten- 
 ded to be thrown into a hopper by a shovel or wheel- 
 barrow load at a time, instead of a single ear or two, 
 as is the common method. In case of a sudden rise 
 in grain, as was the case a few years ago, when it 
 was wanted for export, such a machine would have 
 quite an effect on the market, and would be very val- 
 uable. We should like to particularize many other 
 implements, but are compelled to be short for want 
 of space. 

In the other departments of the exhibition, flow- 
 ers, <fruit, vegetables, dairy products, articles of do- 
 mestic manufacture and fine arts, samples of grain, 
 &c., there were very great deficiencies as to num- 
 ber, and inexcusably so. We cannot account for 
 this except that the premiums to be awarded were 
 not considered sufficient to pay for damage, trouble 
 and expense of a long journey. We saw one firkiu
