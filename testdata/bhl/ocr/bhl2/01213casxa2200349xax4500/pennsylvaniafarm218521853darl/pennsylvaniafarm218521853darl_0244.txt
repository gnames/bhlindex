EDITORIAL, 

November, 

and description of which, we are indebted to our 
 friends â€” David Townsend and Dr. J. K. Eshelman 

of this county. In our nest number, we shall also, 
 sive the result of the Pomoloorlcal discussion at its 
 recent meeting in Philadelphia, which will give some 
 addition to the former list. For the information of 
 some of our readers, we may mention, that by the de- 
 cision of the Congress, all fruits are divided into 
 three classes, designated by the terms, "good, very 
 good, best." A fruit not coming under either of 
 these, is regarded as unworthy of cultivation; while 
 the adopted list contains nothing unworthy of culti- 
 vation, anywhere, so far as ascertained, and is well 
 deservina; the attention of Fruit Growers. It is no 
 less true, that there arc many of our native fruits, 
 which have been proved to be highly valuable in Penn. 
 sylvania as regards flavor, productiveness and other 
 good qualities, which were not placed on this list, 
 but onlyreccommended for trial. As has been well re- 
 marked by one of our correspondents, there are people 
 in this State" who can distinguish a good fruit from a 
 persimmon." There is no doubt of this fact, and, 
 although our Eastern friends, may bo unwilling to 
 have recommended for general cultivation by the Con- 
 gress, till th^ij fruited them some years hence, such 
 choice varieties, as the Jefferis, and Smokehouse Ap- 
 ples; Diller,Brandywine, andOtt Pears,&c. TFe have 
 no hesitation in urging these at once, as exactly 
 suitable to our section of the Union. There can be 
 no difference of opinion as to their superior quality, 
 and if the lists of the Congress are to be of in. 
 fluence in determining the choice of varieties, it is right 
 that we should avail ourselves,in addition, of such 
 of our own seedlings as have been proved and tried, 
 here. Climate and soil have much influence on fruit, 
 and many varieties of fine quality in some sections, 
 are indifferent elsewhere. If the Jefferis apple had 
 originated in New England, it would by this time 
 have had a world wide reputation. We consider it 

second to no other apple known. 

The importance of bringing before the public our 
 Pennsylvania seedling fruits, which we believe 
 are fully equal to any now known in the Union, has 
 been for some time past, felt to be a great desidera- 
 tum, and we are pleased to be able to say that at the 
 recent State Fair, a meeting of Pomologists for vari- 
 ous sections of the State, was held in the Floral Hall, 
 at which it was determined to establish a State Pom- 
 ological Society. The first meeting, of which notice 
 will appear in our next number, to be held the com- 
 ing winter at Harrisburg, at the same time as the 

State Agricultural Society. 
 We shall be pleased to receive from any of our 

readers, specimens of such fine seedlings as may be 
 found in their neighborhoods to be engraved for the 
 Farm Journal. 

The processes of the manufacture of Butter and 
 Cheese, of some of the contributors in this depart 
 ment, at the late State Fair, shall appear in our next. 

To Correspondents, 

All communications having reference to the Farm 
 Journal, must for the future be addressed 'Ho the Ed- 
 itor of the Farm Journal," West Chester, Pa. The 
 residence of the editor, A. M. Spanglcr, is still in 
 Lancaster, where those having private business with 
 him, are requested to direct their communications. 
 Business communications relating to the financial 
 concerns of the paper, must be addressed post paid 
 to Bowen, Meredith & Co., West Chester, Pa. 

We shall be much obliged if our correspondents 
 will forward their contributions for the next No. of 
 the Farm Journal immediately. The delay in the 
 present issue may, also, prevent the issue of the next 
 number exactly on the 1st prox., but it is the inten- 
 tion of the present publishers to be more punctual in 
 this respect than has hitherto been the case. We hope 
 our friends in all parts of the country, will give us 
 their assistance in writing out for the Journal such 
 results of their own experience and practice, or that 
 of their neighborhoods, as may have fallen under 
 their observation. Agriculture, in its comprehen- 
 sive sense, embraces a wide field of investigation and 
 experiment. In one or more of its varied departments 
 it would seem occasionally to come within the range 
 of thought, and attract the attention of all classes of 
 the community. The citizen, confined to his small 
 grass plot, and his narrow flower border, his grape 
 vine trellis and perhaps his two or three shade trees, 
 as well as the practical farmer with his broad acres. 
 From one and all, the scientific, no less than the prac- 
 tical experimenter, we invite contributions and aid, 
 to make the only strictly agricultural paper in the 
 State, what it ought to be. 

Several communications, crowded out by the State 
 Exhibition reports, shall appear in our next. 

liabels for Fruit Trees. 

We have found the following receipt,taken from an 
 English work, to make an indelible Ink, for writing 
 on Zinc, and one not affected by the weather : Cut 
 up the common sheet zinc into strips about half inch 
 wide by 2 or 3 inches long, and write with a quill 
 pen. The zinc should previously be made bright. 
 Through a hole at one end introduce a thin copper 
 wire, long enough to encircle a branch or limb, and 
 it will remain for years, giving to the owner of a 
 newly planted orchard the satisfaction of knowing, 
 at all times, his vai-ieties. Care in respect to labels 
 would obviate much of the confusion in all parts of 
 the country, as to correct nomenclature. " Take 1 
 drachm of Verdegris, 1 drachm sal ammonia powder, 
 and half a drachm of Lamp Black, and mix with 
 10 drach.iis of water." Shake before using. 

We shall be obliged if the Secretaries of the differ- 
 ent County Agricultural Societies, or some of our oth- 
 er Friends, will forward us accounts of the different 
 exhibitions for publication.
