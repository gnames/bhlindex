very perfijct Apple quinces, by the same contributor, 
 were awarded the first premium. 

Of pears, Mr. Siimiivjh.^,d probahli/ the greatest va- 
 riety; a few only named, the rest a perfect babel. 
 Mr. Baxter, of Philadelphia, had a good collection, 
 a single specimen of his Duchess d'Angouleme weigh- 
 ing 18} .■)z. J. K. Eshelman, of Chester countj'', ex- 
 hibited 22 varieties of his own production, and 6 from 
 the experimental grounds of Thom.xs Harvey, of 
 Delaware co., some of which were new in this re- 
 gion, and looked very tempting. Probably, the best 
 on exhibition was a plate of "French Butter," by Pe- 
 ter Bernheisel, of Dauphin county. Would it not 
 be judicious to offer a premium for the best dozen or 
 best four varieties, a dozen each? 

Of Grapes, Mr. Baxter had 6 varieties ; Mr. Sum- 
 my, of Lancaster county, and Mr. Cocklin, of York 
 county, had luscious (these I tasted) Isabellas and 
 Catawbas. Fine looking Sweet Water and small- 
 er parcels by others. Cherries and other fruit 
 preserved in alcohol graced the tables. For what 
 purpose ? To learn persons to become spiritual or 
 show the size of fruit? Oi Fruit preserved in sugar 
 and jellies, there wa? the greatest dearth. Why so 
 little? Certainly in three private houses wiiilo at- 
 tending the Fair, I saw finer looking jelly than any 
 on exhibition. 

The Cases of Birds elicited much admiration. But 
 S. T. Rathvon, of Lancaster, with his entomological 
 collection, capped the climax. Here might the Far- 
 mer, Mechanic, Florist, Arboriculturist and House- 
 wife meet face to face their best friends and worst 
 enemies. There might be seen the apple tree borer, 
 [saperda hiviifaia,) the peach tree borer, [^-Ejeria ex- 
 itiosa,) in their perfect state. The former is rapidly 
 approaching us, and cultivators cannot too soon make 
 themselves acquainted with its appearance and hab- 
 its and best mode of destruction. But half of your 
 Journal would not afford space enough to do justice 
 to this collection. Space and time fail to write of the 
 other novelties and sweets in this tent. Excuse the 
 errors and omissions of One in the Crowd.

 Coccinella Borealis. 

This insect belongs to a tolerablynumerous Coleop- 
 terous family, cocci nellidce, commonly termed lady- 
 birds, and may be regarded as a benefactor to some 
 kinds of vegetation, or those liable to be infested with 
 Aphides or plant lice. The larvae as well as the per- 
 fect insects m[ the various species of coccinella feed 
 almost exclusively upon these plant lice, upon which 
 account they should be regarded with care, rather 
 than wantonly destroyed. The body, (of which the 
 above cut is not a faithful renrescntation, the legs 
 and the antennoe beiuGr entirely too long, and the 
 head and thorax too naiTow) is of a hemispherial 
 form, of a yellow or orange color, and having seven 
 black spots on each wing cover, arranged in trans- 
 verse rows, with four smaller spots on the thorax or 
 chest. On being taken in the hand alive, they ex- 
 ude a yellow mucus, which has rather an offensive 
 smell. Next to coccinella mali it is the largest spe- 
 cies of the genus common to this region. The larvae 
 is composed of eleven segments, to the first three of 
 which are attached three pairs of legs. The form is 

long, flattened, and tapering to rather a pointed tail, 
 (and by no means agreeable in appearance) having a 
 rough surfiace, of a blackish color, with yellow spots. 
 The transformations usually take place upon the 
 leaves where they feed, and it is not an uncommon 
 thing to see eggs, larvaj, pupa, and the mature insect, 
 all at one tim? ; from which circumstance we may 
 safely infer that there arc several broods in one season. 
 It changes to a short oval chrysalis, attache d by the 
 terminal segment or tail, invvaiohthj future perfect 
 insect is visible, and also bears some resemblance to 
 the larvffi, especially as to color. The first transfor- 
 mations take place in May and June. In the win- 
 ter they creep into crevices, (the females at least) or 
 under the bark of decayed wood. I have taken num- 
 bers of them in early spring, from under tlie bark of 
 decaying trees. It is of importance to the farmer 
 and the cultivator of vegetables and flowering plants, 
 to know that these insects visit plants only for the 
 purpose of feeding upon those pests of all tender veg- 
 etation, namely. Aphides or plant lice. And in or- 
 der that their young should have their necessary food 
 near at hand, the provident female deposits her eggs 
 in the midst of a colony of plant lice, and then leaves 
 them for time to bring into life and active useful- 
 ness. . . S. S. R.

EsTHERTON, Sept. 23rd, 1852. 
 Mr. Spang ler: 

I send you the result of a careful 
 experiment made with different manures, applied in 
 different ways in planting Potatoes. 

On the 19th of May, I selected 126 Mercer Pota- 
 toes, without core, as nearly the same size as possible, 
 and weighing about three to the pound. I cut each 
 potato lengthwise into two pieces, and planted them 
 in my garden in sand}' loam soil, in hills two and a 
 half feet apart, three pieces in each hill, rows side by 
 side, and attended to them from planting to raising 
 myself. 

No. 1. Contains 12 hills. Applied Kentish Guano, 

manufactured in N. York, 
 2 oz. to the hill. Covered 
 the potato one inch with 
 ground before applying 
 the Guano, and one inch 
 after. 
 No. 2. " 12 " Applied Saline Fertilizer, 

manufactured in Phil'a., 
 covered as No. 1. 
 No. 3. " 12 " Potatoes first rolled in 

Plaster, then applied 2 oz. 
 to the hill, and covered as 
 No. 1. 
 No. 4. '• 12 " Air slacked lime, 3 oz. to 

hill, covered as No. 1. 
 No. 5. " 12 " Well rotted, short Barn 

Yard manure on the Po- 
 tato, and covered 2 inch- 
 es with ground. 
 No. 6. " 12 " Short Barn Yard manure 

under the Potato, and cov- 
 ered as No 5. 
 No. 7. " 12 " Peruvian Guano, 2 oz. to 

the hill, covered as No. 1' 
 To day I raised them.
