Will some one of your mmy readers, try the experi- 
 ment on Lime stone and Slate soils. I had before tried 
 Peruvian Guano on Wheat, Corn and Oats. On the 
 Oats there was a marked benefit, the growth being so 
 much taller and ranker in those spots where it had been 
 sown as to be observable at the distance of a hundr o d 
 yards. On wheat and Corn I could perceive no dif- 
 ference. A. 0. HUSTER.

As Fruit culture is attracting the attention of Far- 
 mers and others, I hope your correspondents will 
 from time to time, as in their power, give information 
 of such seedling fruits as are deemed worthy of cul- 
 tivation. It is believed this and the neighboring.coun- 
 ties do furnish native fruits of as much excellency as 
 any portion of our country, many of which are scarce- 
 ly known beyond the neighborhood of their origin- 
 This is to bo regrstted, pavtioulaidy as the soil and 
 climate where they originate, and have proved their 
 good qualities, are sure guarantees that in this region 
 at least, they may be cultivated with success; and it 
 may also be presumed tiiat what suits this climate 
 will succeed well in a large portion of the Union. 
 As you have shown a liberal spirit in giving accounts 
 and representations of Animals, Implements, &c.. 

interesting to farmers, it is hoped you will encourage 
 the diffusion of the knowledge, history, properties, 
 and description of new fruits, particuhirly of our 
 luxtlve seedlings of worth. Some of your sul>scri))ers 
 believe you would render good service to the commu- 
 nity by calling more particular attention to an ex- 
 cellent Apple tliat is known to perhaps but few, al- 
 though it has been exhibited at some of the Ilarticul- 

tural Exhibitions in the eastern part of the State for 
 several years. I mean the "Jeffeuis Apple." It 
 originated on the farm of Isaac Jcfferis, in Newlin 
 township, Chester county. Pa., and was ^by him ex- 
 hibiteil to the Chester County Horticultural Society, 
 at their Autumnal Exhibition, in 1S4S, and by the 
 Committee on Seedling Fruits, named "Jefferis," 
 by which name it has since been known. At the 
 late meeting of the "American Pomological Society," 
 the Committee on Native Fruits pronounced it "best," 
 which, in Pomological language, moans "first-rate." 
 The following is a description of the fruit. 

Sh.\pe, oblate-spheroidal. Skix, in its ground 
 color, lemon yellow, streaked and stained with red, 
 l)ut on the side next to the sun, deepening into rich 
 red. dotted with wliite spots, and a little russety 
 round the stalk or stem. Stalk, about half an inch 
 long, slender, inserted in, a narrow, deep cavity. — 
 Calxh:, woolly, nearly closed, set in a regular, well 
 formed, deep" basin. Flesu, white, crisp, tender, 
 melting, juicy and of exceedingly pleasant favor. In 
 use from the middle of August until late in October, 
 and is an excellent fruit both for cooking and the 
 dessert. Its superior, for the season, I have not met 
 with. Tree, a rather moderate grower, with upright 
 habit, and said to be a constant and abundant bearer. 
 It can be had at some of the Chester County Nurse- 
 ries. DAVID TOWNSEND.
