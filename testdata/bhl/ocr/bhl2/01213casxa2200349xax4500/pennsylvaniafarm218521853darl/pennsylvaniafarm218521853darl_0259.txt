Hollinan's, an imported horse ; the grey stallion of 
 same breed, owned by Messrs. Styer & Weaver, and 
 a number of others, are very superior draught horses. 
 The two Norman horses we deem entitled each, to a 
 premium of eight dollars, being thorough bred and 
 possessing unusual muscular strength. 

The best stallion for quick draught was the "Eng- 
 lish Clifton," owned by Mr. J. Reed, of Dauphin 
 county, entitled to a premium of fifteen dollars. 

The second best stallion for quick draught was the 
 dun stallion, "Golden Eclipse," owned by Mr. Amos 
 Young, of Bucks county, entitled to a premium of 
 ten dollars. 

The best stallion for the saddle, "Tom Morgan," 
 by an imported horse owned by Mr. John Clarke, of 
 Philadelphia, entitled to a premium of fifteen dollars. 

The second best stallion for the saddle, "Black 
 Clifton," owned by Mr. Samuel Huston, of Cumber- 
 land county, entitled to a premium of ten dollars. 

The grey stallion owned by Mr. E. Lewis of Phil- 
 adelphia county. 

The bay stallion, owned by John Stout, of Phila- 
 delphia; the bay stallion owned by Messrs. Bear & 
 Maginnis, of Lancaster county; the well-bred horse 
 "Sir Charles," owned by Lucian Wilson, of Juniata. 
 The sorrel horse " Sir Henry, " owned by Mr. 
 Taylor, and a number of other well-bred horses of 
 the same class were presented, and were considered 
 as all very superior. 

The best stallion colt, between two and four years 
 old, is the deep bay of the "Lion" breed, owned by 
 Mr. John Mylan, of Lancaster county, entitled to a 
 preminm of ten dollars. 

The second best stallion colt, between two and

 titled to a premium of six dollars. 

The best horse colt, between one and two years 
 old, "Cobham," owned by Mr. Peter Brugh, of Fi-ank- 
 lin county, entitled to a premium of six dollars. 

The second best horse colt, "Wild Mettle," owned 
 by Mr. E. Trout, of Bedford county, entitled to apre- 
 mium of four dollars. 

The numljer of brood mares was limited, and, in 
 the opinion of the Committee, many superior to those 
 exhibited owned by members of the society were not 
 present. In our judgment, none of the first class 
 were offered. The best broodmare for" heavy draught 
 is the brown mare of Mr. Jacob Rohrer, of Lancas- 
 ter county, to which the Committee award the pre- 
 mium of ten dollars. 

The second best, the bay mare of Mr. David Styer, 
 of Lancaster county, a premium of six dollars. 

No superior mares for quick draught were exhibit- 
 ed. The best was a roan mare, owned by Mr. G. 
 Withers, of Lebanon county, to which a premium of 
 six dollars was awarded. 

Tne best Filly mare colt, between two and five years 
 old, is the dark brown Filly of Mr. A. Lauglilin, of 
 Cumberland county, a premium of eight dollars 
 OT'arded. 

The second best is the iron grey Filly, "Wild Met- 
 tle," owned by Mr. J. W. Beuhler, of Bedford coun- 
 ty ; a premium of five dollars awarded. 

Some fine horses, amongst them the Ijlack stallion 
 of Mr. Quinett, of Pittsburg, arrived too late to be 
 registered under the regulations. 

The stallions of heavy draught presented were nu- 
 merous, many of them approaching the first class. 
 A large number for quick draught, saddle and light 
 harness were exhibited, many of them, also, approach- 
 ing the first class. So as to render it extremely dif- 

ficult to determine to which premiums should be 
 awarded.

QUICK DRAUGHT AND SADDLE HORSES. 

The Committeeon Quick Draught and Saddle Hors- 
 es, respectfully report, that Wm. Griffith, of Dauphin, 
 and Samuel Williams, of Philadelphia, being absent, 
 â– John A. Beaumont, of Bucks, was appointed Chair- 
 man, and that the places of the absentees was sup- 
 plied by the appointment of Christian Kenongy, of 
 Lancaster county, and John P. Jenkins, of Philadel- 
 phia county. Thus constituted, the Committee pro- 
 ceeded to the performencc of the duties assigned 
 them. 

The exhibition of pairs of Carriage Horses, was 
 not as large as the occasion would seem to have re- 
 quired, as might reasonably have been expected, from 
 the marked competition in horses under other classi- 
 fications. 

Col. S. C. Stambaugh, of Lancaster, exhibited a 
 very superior pair of Carriage Horses, on the 2 1st 
 inst., but not having had them regularly entered, they 
 were not for that reason alone considered by the Com- 
 mittee in the awarding of Premiums. 

For the best pair of Carriage Horses, the Commit- 
 tee awarded to Jonathan S. Beekley, of Lebanon co., 
 the Premium of SIO. 

For the second best pair of Carriage Horses, the 
 Committee award to Wm. L. Smith, of Allegheny 
 county, the premium of $6. 

Charles P. Steinmetz, of Lebanon count}-, also ex- 
 hibited a pair of fine Carriage Horses. 

Quite a number of superior Geldings for quick- 
 draught and saddle, were exhibited single, and al- 
 though in the printed schedule of preiiiums, no pro- 
 vision would seem to have been made for this class, 
 the Committee call the omission to the attention of 
 the Executive Committee, and most rjspectfully re- 
 commend a premium of SIO for the 1)est quick draught 
 Horse, ( ) to John B. Edwards, of Lan- 

caster county, and a premium of six dollars for the 
 second best quick draught and saddle Horse, to Ben- 
 jamin Hershey, of Lancaster county. 

The Committee also took pleasure in noticing the 
 fact that J. 11. Strickler, of Lancaster county, ex- 
 hibited two superior quick draught and saddle hors- 
 es, and that Cyrus S. Ilaldeman, of Lancaster coun- 
 ty, exhibited a very fine and perfectly trained family 
 horse for single harness. 

F. S. Bletz, of Lancaster county, also exliibitsd a 
 very superior saddle and quick drauglit horse. 

The Committee also report that a number of gel- 
 dings between two and four years old, were exhibited, 
 and as they too would seem to stand in the predica- 
 ment of the class last mentioned, th^ coramittec re- 
 spectfully recommend a premium of SIO for the best 
 colt gelding to Samue. Huuston, of Cumberland co. 

The Committee beg leave also to remark, that Jas. 
 Lee, of Cumberland county, exhibited a very fine 
 three year old gelding, and Richard Andorson, of 
 Cumberland coanty, a three year old Filley. 

All of which is respectfully submitted.
