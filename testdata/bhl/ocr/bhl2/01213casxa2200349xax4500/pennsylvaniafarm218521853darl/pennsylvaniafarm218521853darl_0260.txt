HORSES, HEAVY DRAUGHT MULES AND 
 TEAMS. 

To the President of the Pennsylvania State Agri- 
 cultural Society. i u. tit i 

The Committee on Horses, heavy draught Mules 
 and Teams, make the following report, to wit: That 
 tbey have awarded to John Benson, for the best pair 
 of Mules, a premium of $8. To David Mast, lor the 
 best Jack, a premium of $8. , o • 

The Committee regret very much that the Society 
 have not directed premiums to be allowed for the 
 best and second best draught Horses, and presume it 
 must have been a neglect on the part of the Commit- 
 tee who arranged the list of Premiums. Wo, as a 
 Committee on that important branch of Agricultu- 
 ral interests, would respectfully recommend that a 
 premium of $8 be paid to Henry Baumgardner for 
 the best draught Horse. And, also to Samuel Ruby, 
 of York county, for the second best a premium of $5. 

Your Committee regret exceedingly that the compe- 
 tition in the exhibition of draught Horses, Mules and 
 Teams, has been so extremely limited, and would re- 
 commend to the Society, at its next annual exhibition, 
 to offer premiums that would be some inducement to 
 the owners of the kind of Stock to exhibit the same. 
 Wo would, therefore respectfully recommend thatthe 
 following premiums be offered for the next exhibition: 
 For the best team of five Horses, $15. For the sec- 
 ond best ditto, ditto, $10. For the third best ditto, 
 ditto, $5. For the best team of six Mules, $15. For 
 the second best ditto, ditto, $10. For the third best 
 ditto, ditto, $5 For the best pair of Plough and 
 Farm Horses, $10. For the second best ditto, ditto, 
 $5. For the best Cart and Dray Horse, $8. For the 
 second best ditto, ditto, $5. 

The above report is respectfully submitted.

CATTLE TWO YEARS OLD, AND UPWARDS. 

The Committee on cattle two years old, and up- 
 wards, would respectfully report that they have at- 
 tended to the duties assigned them, and in coming to 
 their decision, have given such time and attention in 
 their examination, as its importance demanded. 

Your committee were very much gratified to find 
 so large a number of fine cattle on the ground for 
 exhibition, but should have been pleased to find a 
 more general competition in some of the breeds of 
 cattle. Your committee feel the importance and 
 would urge the adoption of measures for the estab- 
 lishment and publication of a herd book for the State, 
 similiar to "Coate's" English herd book, in whieh to 
 enter the names of stock breeders, their stock pedi- 
 gree, &c., as well aa their issue from year to year. 
 Such a record would be invaluable to breeders, fur- 
 nishing a safe and easy source hereafter, of tracing 
 the pedigree of cattle brought for exhibition. It 
 would also furnish purchasers of stock important in- 
 formation. Six three year old Durham steers were 
 exhibited by Isaac Landis, of Lancaster county, fine 
 animals. No premiums being fixed to such stock, 
 they are recommended to the favorable consideration 
 of the Executive committee — premium awarded, $8. 
 We would also recommend the fine herd of cattle of 
 various breeds exhibited by General George Cadwal- 
 ader, to the attention of the Executive committee — 

{)remium awarded, $15. Your committee congratu- 
 ate the society upon the great Buccese which has so 

fjir attended this noble enterprise. The present large 
 and respectable display of stock and other useful ar- 
 ticles in husbandry, speaks well for the future, and 
 we hope that at no distant day the Pennsylvania 
 State Agi'icultural Society will rival, at least, any 
 other Agricultural Society in the Union The follow- 
 ing is a list of premiums awarded :
