It would have afforded your committee much more 
 gratification to have seen a more numerous display 
 for competition. They beg leave to use the freedom 
 to suggest that all who have any garden products on 
 coming occasions, should bring them forward freely, 
 as in many instances the prizes far eclipse the value 
 of the articles on which tliey are bestowed. There was 
 no article closely competed for, unless that of cabbage, 
 two other lots of which were within a shade of being 
 equal to the twelve that obtained the first prize. We are 
 indebted to the spirit of our fellow member, Peter 
 Bright, Esq. , for having brought to our notice the 
 great seedling potatoe, from the Wabash, Indiana, 
 called "seedling pink eye," There Avere seven cf 
 them, averaging 2 lbs each, and some have been known 
 to be as heavy as 4 lbs., and are in quality and pro- 
 ductiveness (as report says) equal to their size. 

All of which is respectfully submitted.
