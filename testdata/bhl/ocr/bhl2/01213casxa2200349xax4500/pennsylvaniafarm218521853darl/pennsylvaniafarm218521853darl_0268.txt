MECHANIC ARTS AND UNENUMERATED 
 ARTICLES, No. 29. 

To the President and Officers of the Pennsylva- 
 nia State Agricultural Society, now meeting at Lan- 
 caster: 

Your Committee appointed to examine articks un- 
 der Class No. 29, on 2d Class of Uuenuraerated Ar- 
 ticles, wonld respectfully report that they have atten- 
 ded to that duty, and beg leave to make the following 
 report : 

Two large Urns, marked on the list silver, but 
 which were plated, presenting no novelty, except per- 
 haps antiquity, deposited by Thomas E. Shull, of 
 Mifflin county. By Diffenbach & Kenneagy, Stras- 
 burg, six samples of Iron Railings. By John W. 
 "Wilson, of Lancaster, several specimens of Marb e 
 Work, for which we recommend a diploma. By C. 
 Keiffer, of Lancaster, one Cast Iron Sofa; one do. do. 
 Chair; one do. do. Tree Box; one do. d ;. Panel of 
 Fence; one Wrought Iron Gate. The gate was very 
 well made, and the castings good. We could not as- 
 certain whether the design was original or borrowed. 
 Recommend a diploma. By Thomas II. Burrows, of 
 Lancaster, two setts School Desks and Chairs, a di- 
 ploma. By Lewis Haldy, of Lancaster, one Tomb- 
 stone of Rutland Marble, a diploma. By Lewis 
 Bridge of York, Parlor Stove. By Alexander Brad- 
 ley, of Pittsburg, three Parlor Cottage Franklin 
 Stoves, two Cook Stoves, and one Coal Stove. The 
 Franklin Stoves were neat in design and workman- 
 ship, and the arrangement of the dampers and blow- 
 ers was very convenient and superior, and for them 
 we would recommend the first premium of $5. By 
 Wm. Brady, of Mount Joy, one case Mill Picks, Ax- 
 es, &c. The display was the best, the articles well 
 finished, and to all appearances such as would reflect 
 credit on any establishment, and for them we would 
 recommend a premium of $5. By Henry Brinkman, 
 of Lancaster, one Cooking Stove, most of it wrought 
 iron. We could, in the absence of the maker, dis- 
 cover no peculiar quality about it. By Geo. D. Sprech- 
 er, five stoves, very good articles. By Samuel Haines, 
 of Cumberland county, two Axes and one Hatchet; 
 these appeared to be good articles, and well formed, 
 though not so highly finished as others exhibited. A 
 diploma. By Russel & Geiger, of Lancaster, display 
 of Stoves, made by North, Harrison & Chase. Abbot 
 & Lawrence, of Philadelphia, a good display of well 
 made articles. By 1. C. Middleton, one dozen improv- 
 ed Knife and Scissors Sharpeners. 

AH of which is respectfully submitted.

PLOWING MATCH. 

The Committee on Ploughs and Ploughing, re- 
 spectfully report that they have attended to the duty 
 assigned to them, and have awarded the first premi- 
 um for a plough, to Prouty & Barrett, for their No. 
 55, of $8. The second premium to -Jesse Pauling, of 
 IMontgomery county, ?5. The third premium to Hall 
 & Spear, of Pittsburg, for their No. 10, of $3. The 
 fourth premium to Jacob Wenger, of Lancaster 
 county, of ??2. They have awarded the first premi- 
 um for plougning, to E. G. Gray, of $15. The second 
 to .Jolui Phxnk, of $10. The third to Robert II. 
 Blake, of $S. The fourth to Jonathan F. Garrard, of ;?2. 
 The whole of the work was done in a highly cred- 
 itable manner, and there was much merit in many of 
 the ploughs that have no premiums awarded to them. 
 _ The Committee would much like to be al)le to no- 
 tice these latter more particularly, but are at present 

unable so to do from press for time, the hour for the 
 promulgation of the presentment having arrived be- 
 fore your Committee had finished their labor. .

FIRE PROOF CHEST. 

The Committee appointed to superintend the test- 
 ing of the fire-proof qualities of Evans & Watson's 
 Fire-Proof Chests, respectfully report. That in pur- 
 suance of their appointment, they placed in one of 
 the above named chests, a large number of papers, 
 and after having locked the chest and secured the 
 keys, they saw piled around and upon it, about three 
 cords of dry wood. At 11 o'clock, A. M., fire was 
 applied to this, and at 2 J o'clock, P. M., the wood 
 being consumed, the chest having attained a white 
 heat, the coals were drawn away, and the chest suf- 
 fered to cool. On opening the chest, the papers were 
 removed, not entirely unscathed, but sound and per- 
 fect as when placed in the chest.

MEETING OF THE LANCASTER COUNTY 
 AGRICULTURAL, SOCIETY. 

At a meeting of the Lancaster County Agricultu- 
 ral Society, October 1st, 1852, the following report 
 was read and ordered to be published : 

The Fruit Committee of the Lancaster County Ag- 
 ricultural Society do report to the President and 
 members generally, That in the very pleasant duty 
 assigned them, of examining and testing fruit, they 
 have had one meeting since their last report, Septem- 
 ber 9th, 1852. The committee bad given public no- 
 tice of the time, with a request that persons having 
 good fruit, should exhibit specimens to the commit- 
 tee. But with few exceptions, their desire to make 
 known, and, as a consequence, disseminate more 
 extensively any new and good fruit, was not respond- 
 ed to with that ardor which the committee would 
 wish. Yet the committee believe, if their labors are 
 continued in connection with similar committees and 
 individuals in other sections, the "signs of the times" 
 give them hope that there are strong indications of a 
 more general appreciation of good fruit, and a desire 
 among the great mass of farmers and others, to pro- 
 cure and cultivate none but the most select. By the 
 few specimens presented, as well as from other sour- 
 ces, the committee are fully of the opinion that many 
 valuable seedling fruits remain in comparativo ob- 
 scurity throughout the county of Lancaster. To bring 
 these before the public, requires time, with aid and 
 assistance from all sections of the county, frequent 
 meetings of the committee at different seasons, to 
 test the various fruits of summer, autumn and win- 
 ter. 

At the present time, we find a stronger interest ex- 
 hibited all over the counti'y towards the acquisition 
 of good fruit, than at any former period — and we are 
 greatly encouraged in our labors by the cheering 
 prospect that, with the aid of individuals, commit- 
 tees, societies and pomological congresses, much 
 good will ultimately result to Pomology and Horti- 
 culture generally. 

Among the specimens presented, the committee 
 consider the following as worthy of a brief notice :
