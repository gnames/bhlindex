CHAPPELL'S IMPROVED FERTILIZER— Substitute for Guano. 

The subscriber would call the attention of the Farmers of Penn- 
 sylvania to the chemical compound or manure, manufactured by 
 him for the renovation of " worn-out lands," and known as 
 ''chappel's improved fertilizer." 

This'article is composed of the same materials as arc found by 
 analysis in the ash of plants. It consists of a mixture (in proper 
 proportions) of B'-Phosphate of Lime and Magnesia, (or bones dis- 
 solved in Sul|)hurie Acid,) Sulphates of Ammonia, Potash, Soda 
 andLim-", Animal Charcoal, Silicates of Potash, Alumina and Mag- 
 Tiesia, and, as these constituents indicate, is intended to restore to 
 the soil' all the inorganic materials abstracted by vegetation. It 
 has been ascertained that a soil containing a sufficient quantity of 
 these salts, is always fertile ; and their absence ct)ustitutes what 
 is called '■^Worn-out Land." The analysis of rich soils shows a 
 good supply, and poor land a deficiency. 

The inorganic matter abstracted from the soil by the growth of 
 different crops is the same, varying only in proportion ; it is there- 
 fore evident, that if we supply to the soil a sufficient quantity of 
 each material thus abstracted, we restote its fertility. 

The correctness of the above has been fully sustained by the use 
 of the Fertilizer, the last season. It has been used on poor land, 
 and twenty-five t') twenty eight bushels of wheat obtaiiie<l, with 
 a superior crop of clover. As a top-dressing on wheat, eight bush- 
 els additional yield has been realized. On the spring crops of corn, 
 oats and clover, the yield has been doubled It has been used on 
 tiie same field (as an experiment) with the best Peruvian Guano, 
 both on corn and oats, and the yield has resulted in favor of the 
 Fertilizer. The most respectable reference can be given of its 
 value and effects on p;)or lands. 

This article having been used with such favorable results, the 
 manufacturer now offers it to agriculturists, with the full confi- 
 dence that It will largely repay for the outlay, and that it is the 
 cheapest manure they can use. 

Oil very poor land, two barrels to the acre should be applied ; on 
 that in better condition, one and a half barrels. It is calculated, in 
 using two barrels, you supply to the soil sufficient salts for a rota- 
 tion. As a top-dressing, one barrel put on after a ram, or when the 
 land is wet, and in all cases near the surface and not ploughed in, 
 broad-cast and harrowed when practicable. The Ammonia in this 
 preparation is a Sulphate and therefore not volatile as in Guano; 
 the Bi-Phosphates and Sulphates being soluble, the rain dissolves 
 them, and they thus saturate the soil with prepared food, ready for 
 the nourishment of the plant; being rich in Sulphates, they are 
 powerful abSDrbents of Ammonia from the atmosphere. 

One fact peculiar to this compound is that such portion as may 
 not beabstraeted from the soil the first crop, remains in thegrouiid 
 until consumed by after vegetation One barrel of Chappell's Im- 
 proved Fertilizer contains as inueh Phosphate n/Limea.s is contain- 
 ed ill 3U0 ll>s Peruvian Guano; therefore, by the application of two 
 barrels (400 lbs ) to an acre, the ground is supplied with as much 
 phosphate of lime as if 400 lbs. best Peruvian Guano had been used, 
 and the Fertilizer is furnished at lees than half the cost. 

VVe add a few certificates. We could add nthers, but this mode 
 of advertising is expensive — these should be sufficient to recommend 
 the Fertilizer to the favorable notice of all farmers, desiring to 
 improve their lands. 

The f )lli)wing from gentlemen of high standing, testifies to the 
 action of the Fertilizer, compared with Peruvian and Patagoiiian 
 Guano. (From Cora. T. Ap. C. Jones, Washington.)

P. Stockton Chappell — Dear Sir : — I suppose I am indebted to 
 your kindness for a copy of the Baltimore Sun. of 17th March, 
 containing notice of transfer of " South Baltimore Chemical 
 Works" to you. I should have sooner acknowledged your atten- 
 tion, but was anxious to see a further development of the effects 
 of your Fertilizer before I wrote. You may recollect that about 
 a year ago I purchased the first Fertilizer, (a ton) with which I 
 experimented with barley and corn, at the time of planting, and on 
 wheat and grass as a top-dressing, all in compari-ion with Peruvian 
 and Patagonian Guano, at equal cost. The effect on the barley 
 was decidedly in favorof the Fertilizer beyond all question ; while 
 upon wheat, corn and grass, the difference was scarcely discerna- 
 ble on the growing crops. The grouiul on which the barley grew 
 lust year wasseededj with Florence wheat on the 3d dav of Octo- 
 ber, I8.il ; the grouii was in the finest heart, 200 lbs. of Peruvian 
 guona hiving been p'oughed in after fallowing, but before seed- 
 ing, which WIS done with Pennock's drill. The last dressing of 
 guano was carefully sown broadcast transversely to the spring 
 dressing of guani, and to the belt of the Fertilizer, through the 
 barley, which separated the Peruvian and Patagonian guano, and 
 the course of the drill crosses obliquely the belt of about sixty feet 
 on which the Fertilizer was used about a year ago. 

My wheat, like m)st wheat of the season, is but middling; my 
 land w.is ploughed verv deep, and, although it is high and rolling, 
 the wheat has suffered severely from a redundancy of moisture; 
 nevertheless, the wheat on the part on which the Fertilizer was 
 used at the time of sowing the barley, in April, 18oI, is not only 
 higher but stronger, has .a better color, and is in every respect more 
 promising than the wheat on either side of it. notwithstanding the 
 double dressing of guano to one of the Fertilizer. I have also ten 
 acres of corn ground in wheat, on which your Fertilizer was used 
 and sown in comparison with Peruvian guano aud repeated at the 
 time of sowing the wheat; the Fertilizer so far holds its own, and 
 should I live to see it, I will give youparticulars of the harvest 

The conclusions to which my mind is brought by the foregoing 
 experiments are: — 

First— Thatat an equal cost, with less labor, and far greater con- 
 venience in its application, your Fertilizer is fully equal to the 
 average quality of Peruvian guano when first applied, and much 
 more durable in its effects on after crops. 

Secondly — That six hundred pounds (two barrels) of the Fertili- 
 zer, incorporated with the soil with the harrow before seeding or 
 planting, is better than HOO pounds of Peruvian guano, to wh.'ch 
 the fanner is compelled to add, with very considerable labor, one 
 and a half bushels gypsum, the cost of which' will bring theguano 
 at the lowest rates, to $7.S0 

Whilst cost of 60U lbs. fertilizer, 

Difference in favor'of fertilizer. 

Very respectfully, &c.

 P. S. Chappell — Dear Sir: — In answer to your note of this date, 
 asking for my experience m the use of your Fertilizer, I have but 
 time to say, that two or three years ago I used but two or three 
 barrels by way of experiment Last year, I used upwards of sev- 
 enty, and this year I will drop it on every hill of corn that I plant. 
 My experience of its use on corn, in the hill, is most unquestiona- 
 bly and decidedly favorable. Very res|)ectfully. yours, fee.

To Dr. P. S. Chappell — Dear Sir : I have just returned from a 
 visit to Delaware, where I had an opportunity of observing the ef- 
 fects of your Agricultural Salts, in tiie production of wheat. They 
 were applied to two fields — one of twenty acres — the other of 
 twenty-eight. The former is uniformly good — on the latter, a part 
 has been damaged by the growth of blue grass, but niy iinpiession 
 is, the crop, on both, will be one-third greater than it would liave 
 been without the fertilizing article. Tlie grain has imt yet been 
 threshed out, and consequently the above opinion rests merely on 
 general observation of the crop immediately before harvest, but I 
 am satisfied it will not be found incorrect I think it very certain 
 you will have several orders for the Salts, from the vicinity re- 
 ferred to. Very respectfully, 

Your friend and ob't serv't, 

HENRY^V. D. JOHNS. 

Dr. Johns purchased, last fall, tliiftv barrels ; as he used it as 
 above on forty-nine acres, ni)t more than 1, barrels could have 
 been applied to the acre. 

I have used " Chappell's Fertilizer" upon potatoes with decided 
 benefit, and am now fully satisfied that it is the best and clieapest 
 manure I can use for that crop 

My first trial wis alongside of stable and guano manure; the 
 Salts gave me the best and largest potatoes. Where the Salts was 
 used, the land was thin, and on a hill side ; I used :ibout 1 j bbls. 
 t ) the acre in the furrow, with the'usual attention. My crop fully 
 came up to my expectations ; the potatoes were large, and of su 
 perior quality, and the crop fullv one-third greater than any of iny 
 neighbors, whose land wis much richer than the piece of land I 
 used for my potatoes. The same piece of land I have put down 
 in wheat ; the furrows can be seen distinctly some distance off — 
 showing that the Fertilizer is still acting in the soil. 

I shall use the Fertilizi/r this ye it on my potatoes, being fully 
 satisfied that it is the cheapest and best mannre that I can use for 
 that crop. Several of my neighbors intend using the Fertilizer 
 this year. I have paid great attention to the cultivation of potatoes 
 for the Baltimore market for many years, and Irom my e.xperience 
 of two seasons with the Fertilizer, can recommend it with confi- 
 dence upon that crop 

I will add that I sold mr potatoes at Sl,06 per bushel ; my 
 neighbors sold at 9oc — the difference in price owing to the differ- 
 ence 111 quality. Yours truly, Larkin Young.

Chester County, Pa., May 25, 1852. 

On the aoth of August, 1850. I applied l.^iO lbs. of your Fertilizer 
 on a fourth of an acre of poor laml , that had not been fanned for 
 forty years previous to the apolication of the Fertilizer. I had the 
 ground ploughed in April and strewed over it 10 bushels of lime- 
 and about the same of ashes, and chip dirt from wood yard, har- 
 rowed It well with cultivator, and when I put on the Salts F sowed 
 in Turnip Seed. Timothy and Clover and finished off with a brush, 
 The crops of Turnips was 70 bushels, that at 2,') cents brought 
 SI7,50. and at the rate of S70 per acre. Last summer (!f-5I) the 
 crop of good hay was 1,100 lbs , or at the rate of 2i tons per acre, 
 and now CMay, 1S.')2) the appearance of the grass on the same is 
 far better than it was last year. Many persons have been to see 
 this small, though satisfactory experiment, and are becoming con- 
 vinced of the benefits of your Fertilizer.
