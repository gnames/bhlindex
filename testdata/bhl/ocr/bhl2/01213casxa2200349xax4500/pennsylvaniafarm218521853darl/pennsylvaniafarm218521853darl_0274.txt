Bucks Couutj' Exhibition. 

In company with several agricultural friends, we 
 attended the annual Exhibition of the Bucks County 
 Agricultural Society, held at Newtown. The high 
 reputation which these exhibitions have always main- 
 tained, prepared us to expect something fine, and in 
 this we were not disappointed. 

On entering the enclosure, our attention was im- 
 mediately directed to the exceedingly neat and con- 
 venient arrangements for the exhibition. Every thing 
 was in order, and every officer at his post, ready for 
 the discharge of his appointed duties. Near the 
 western end of the enclosure stood the principal tent 
 or canvass, beneath which, fruits, vegetables, flowers, 
 and articles of domestic manufacture, &c., were ex- 
 hibited. This structure was 160 feet long, l>y about 
 40 feet wide, and was commodious, neat and taste- 
 ul. On the northern side of the enclosure, the sheep 
 and swine pens were arranged. The cattle were not 
 kept in stalls, as is usually the case, but were fasten- 
 ed to pannels, so arranged as to have an avenue of 
 at least twenty feet between, thus enabling the spec- 
 tators to view them most advantageously. Another 
 commendable feature in the arrangements, was a 
 large structure, intended for the accommodation of 
 the ladies, exclusively. Beneath its spacious roof, 
 comfortable seats were placed, so that the ladies, when 
 fatigued, could rest themselves in the shade. The 
 fencing, pens, &c., were whitewashed, giving to the 
 whole enclosure an appearance at once beautiful and 
 neat. 

The attendance was numerous for a county exhibi- 
 tion. At least fifteen hundred persons were on the 
 ground during the day, a large proportion of whom 
 were ladies. 

The limited time allowed us for observation, pre- 
 vented as full and complete a report of the exhibition 
 as we desired and intended giving. We saw enough, 
 however, to satisfy us that the farmers of Bucks coun- 
 ty were doing their duty. 

The display of fruits, especially that of apples, (for 
 vrhich Bucks county is famous,) was very fine. The 
 different varieties of apples exhibited, were choice, 
 not merely in point of size, but also in flavor. Amongst 
 them we uotiee some superior specimens of the Fall 
 Pippin, Flat Sweet, Royal Sweet, Fallawater, Maid- 
 ens Blush, Red and White Doctor, Newtown Pippin, 
 Farmer's Fancy, Summer Pearmain, Cider Apples, 
 â€¢ Cornell's Fancy, Jersey Pippin, and a host of others, 
 the names of which we do not recollect. The other 
 varieties of fruit, in season, were also fairly repre- 
 sented. 

The display of articles of domestic manufacture 
 did great credit to those engaged in getting them up, 
 and we earnestly commend the example of the ladies 
 of Bucks county to those of other counties in our 
 State. We were so pressed for time, that we could 
 not more than glance at this department, although 

the many elegant and useful articles it contained 
 merited a long and careful examination. Our atten- 
 tion was, however, directed to some beautifully execu- 
 ted colored crayon sketches and paintings, executed 
 by the daughters of our friend, William Stavely, Esq. 

The display of cattle was very fine, embracing 
 some choice animals, all in excellent condition, 
 Messrs, Adrian and J. C. Cornell exhibited a largo 
 number of fine animals, from their celebrated farms 
 There was a large number of other exhibitors of stock 
 of various kinds ; but having had the misfortune to 
 lose or mislay the notes taken on the ground, we are 
 compelled to forego the pleasure of presenting their 
 names. 

The display of implements was excellent. Amongst 
 them were some very ingeniously constructed ones, 
 from the manufactory of Mr. Buckman, of Pineville. 
 We hope to present illustrations of some of these short- 
 ly. In concluding this hasty sketch, for which we have 
 been compelled to rely solely upon our memory, we can- 
 not forbear an expression of thanks for the many kind 
 attentions extended us by our friends in Bucks. At 
 the same time, we congratulate them upon the grati- 
 fying success which has hitherto attended their ef- 
 forts to build up the cause of agriculture in their 
 county. 

Montgomery County Exhibition. 

Although pressed by engagements on every side, 
 we could not resist the temptation of visiting our 
 friends of Montgomery county, at their annual Exhi- 
 bition, and we are happy to say that our visit was, 
 as usual, a source of much pleasure to us. The ex- 
 cellent arrangement of the Exhibition grounds, a 
 detailed account of which was given in the Journal 
 last Fall, have been materially improved, and the 
 character of the Exhibition kept pace with the other 
 improvements. Wo thought it much better than that 
 of last year, in many respects. The display of cafr- 
 tle was certainly better, many of the animals being 
 of superior character. The largest contributors in 
 this department were the Messrs. Jones, of Consho- 
 hocken, whose display of dairy cattle, was certainly 
 creditable to them. As the notes of this exhibition, 
 taken by us, were contained in the same book with 
 those of Bucks, Berks, Philadelphia and other coun- 
 ties, (which book we have lost,) we hope our friends 
 will excuse the general character of our brief de- 
 scription. 

The display of implements was not as fine as last 
 year, although a number of excellent ones were ex- 
 hibited, but the meagreness of this department was 
 amply compensated for by the quantity *and excel- 
 lence of the articles exhibited in the department of 
 domestic manufactures and fancy articles. 

The roooms in the large building, appropriated tb 
 these articles, were filled to overflowing, with inge- 
 nious, elegant Q.nd useful articles, attesting the taste
