do not make sufficient lard or fat, but they would be 
 more properly called the citizen's. The fat and lean 
 are well mixed throughout the whole carcass, even the 
 side pieces, often rendered up into lard, have the de- 
 sired mixture of a"streak of fat and a streak of lean." 
 Their hams ?lxq plump and y?/i"cy, and just the size 
 for the housekeeper in the city; none too large for 
 the table. We slaughtered one fall, sixteen of pure 
 blood, weighing from 150 to 250, and the most beau- 
 tiful lot of meat we ever had, juicy, of a fine red co- 
 lor, and none of it too fat to be eaten. The Berk- 
 shires will seldom attain the weight of our Chester 
 county breed, but we always considered, from their 
 being so very easily kept, that the same food would 
 make more weight in the aggregate, than any oth- 
 er breed. Some objection used to be made to 
 them on account of their appearance in the market, 
 the skin showing the black spots, and not so white 
 as the white haired hog. This prejudice, however, 
 would soon pass off, as purchasers became acquainted 
 with the superior quality of the meat. 

Do any of our readers know where any pure Berk- 
 shires can be obtained. 

Subsoil Plowing. 

In our monthly notice of work for the Farm, this 
 is recommended; but as we consider it of the great- 
 est importance, will add, that we have proved it so 
 in our own practice. The best subsoil plow we have 
 used, we consider to be Roger's, and which can be 
 purchased at his establishment in Philadelphia, and 
 at the Agricultural Warehouse in West Chester. It 
 has several advantages, among which are that it stirs 
 up the whole width of the furrow, and is easily regu- 
 lated by the one handle, and which enables the plow- 
 man to walk on the hard ground,or land side, instead 
 of toiling through eight or ten inches of loose earth. 
 An engraving of it was given in one of the former 
 numbers of the Farm Journal. Subsoiling is one of 
 the improvements of the day; so simple in its theory, 
 and yet so effectual, that it must neccsarily become 
 general, with good as well as bad farmers; the object 
 of both being to extract from the soil remunerating 
 crops. The only wonder is, that it makes its way 
 to public attention so slowly. There is a mine of 
 wealth, laying dead and unproductive, beneath our 
 ordinary surface plowing, which only needs stirring 
 to the vivifying action of sun and air, to be immediately 
 available for the use of crops. The evidence in the 
 case is cumulative and positive. It has been fully 
 tried in various places, with satisfactory results, and 
 the reason of the thing is so obvious, that argumemt 
 would seem superfluous. To-be-sure, it involves ad- 
 ditional expense. This is not so important as the ques- 
 tion whether that expense is a profitable outlay, and 
 whether it will not return a compound interest. The 
 simple fact of an additional outlay for an extra team, 
 is not of itself an objection to meet the whole case. 

To be on the safe side, let two or three farmers join 
 in the purchase, and try a part of their fields intend- 
 ed for corn next spring, with the subsoil plow, and 
 we liave no doubt as to the results. The advantages 
 of deep digging and trenching, for the vegetable gar- 
 dens have been observed by all. The same princi- 
 ples and practice will apply to field culture. The near- 
 er we can approximate on the farm, to the culture of 
 the garden, in the depth of soil and fine pulveriza- 
 tion the better the success. 

Trees and Flowers of Japan. 

Now that the long talked of expedition to open the 
 ports of Japan to the commerce of the country has 
 sailed, it may reasonably be expected, that the botan- 
 ical treasures known to exist in that hitherto forbid- 
 den ground, may soon be brought to light, and the 
 country opened to botanical exploration. When we 
 consider that the climate is similar to our own, and 
 that many, perhaps most of the Japan trees and 
 plants are hardy here, and that some of our most 
 beautiful specimens are from that country, it is fair 
 to presume that a rich harvest is in store for our Bot- 
 anists and Florists, in the event of a treaty. AVe 
 have already, Paulonia-Inperialis, Salisburia-Adian- 
 tifolia, Cydonia Japonica, Ancuba Japonica, Crypto- 
 meria Japonica, Sophora, Dcutzia Scabra, and Graci- 
 lis, and many others, all perfectly hardy; and the 
 Camellia, which there grows wild and to the size of 
 a tree; Anemone Japonica, and others which stand 
 the open culture in our Southern States; all valuable 
 acquisitions. The Japanese are also said to be en- 
 thusiastic and skilful florists, and particularly suc- 
 cessful in dwarfing all kinds of trees, training and 
 clipping them into fantastic shapes, and have been 
 vei-y successful in grafting and dwarfing the pine fam- 
 ily. Like the Chinese, whose standard of beauty in 
 the human foot is having it artificially compressed into 
 the smallest possible size,8o the Japanese consider the 
 production of a dwarfed tree or plant, as the evidence 
 of skill, and model of beauty. The Botanical Regis- 
 ter gives an account of a dwarf tree being exhibited 
 at Jeddo, in a lacqucrd box, with 6ranc7jes,occupying 
 only two square inches. Uncivilized as we call them, 
 it is more than probable we shall get many new ideas 
 and learn some useful hints, even from the Japanese. 
 We observe the expedition carries out a locomotive 
 and railway cars. Magnetic Telegraph, and many 
 other productions of our superior civilization, calcu- 
 lated to "astonish the natives." It also numbers a- 
 bout 4000 men, and over 300 guns,mostly heavy ord- 
 nance. The steamers mount Paixhan shell guns, 
 mounted on revolving trucks, so as to sweep the ho- 
 rizon, and discharging shells of G8 to 120 lbs. each, 
 and long 42's." 

Such furniture as this, ia intended, and no donbt 
 will succeed in making a very decided impression, and 
 we doubt whether the Japanese will be able to resist
