Subsoil Ploughing. 

Plowing is one of the most important branches of 
 aoriculture — necessary even to its existence. The 
 improvement of practical agriculture, is in propoi-- 
 tion to the improvement made in the art of plough- 
 ing. The principles which chemistry has revealed, 
 may be made abortive — their results defective — by 
 improper ploiving. 

The object to be obtained by plowing is threefold: 
 1st, to pulverize the soil ; 2nd, to expose a great 
 depth of soil to the action of the atmosphere ; 3rd, 
 to hold the many fertilizing substances brought down 
 by rain and snow and absorbed by the soil. 

It becomes necessary to pulverize the soil, so that 
 the roots of plants may extend in all directions free- 
 ly, and to a great distance. The atmosphere coming 
 in contact with deep and well pulverized earth, im- 
 parts heat and moisture, and, acting upon the soil, 
 assists in liberating its salts, and in bringing it into 
 that condition which is the best fitted for the growth 
 of crops. 

A small proportion of water during rains more or 
 less heavy, sinks into the soil when shallow plowed ; 
 such soil is sooner affected by the drouth, and is dry 
 at a greater depth than deep earths, as may be shown 
 by an examination of shallow and deep plowing in a 
 time of drouth. Common plowing does not reach 
 sufficiently deep to accomplish all that is desired; but 
 deep plowing and its good results are effected by fol- 
 lowing the common plow with the subsoil plow. It 
 loosens the subsoil, and leaves it in that state that roots 
 can enter it, that air can permeate it, and water be 
 absorbed by it. A subsequent plowing, with the 
 common plow, can then easily intermix the surface 
 and subsoil. Plowing may thus be effected sixteen 
 to twenty inches deep, 

I have found from frequent examinations of the 
 roots of corn, wheat and oats, during the last four or 
 five years, that they are generally inclined to grow 
 downwards, some of the roots even straight down 
 until they reach the subsoil, then after penetrating 
 an eighth or a fourth of an inch, turn horizontally. 
 I traced a root of a wheat plant which had extended 
 sixteen inches nearly perpendicular, in less than 3 
 months after it had been sowed, on ground previous- 
 ly subsoiled. It is interesting to take the spade and 
 examine the roots of crops, at any stage of their 
 growth, in order to compare the effects of common or 
 shallow, with those of subsoil plowing. To see the 
 roots of corn pushing boldly downwards eighteen 
 inches in search of food, eight inches ef which has 
 never been penetrated except by the noble oak and 
 hickory, and occasionally by the searching taproot of 
 clover, as I have witnessed tlie past summer, affords 
 pleasure as well as instruction to the farmer, who 
 takes pride in fat swine or stall-fed oxen. 

I subsoiled three-fourths of an acre through the 
 middle of an eight acre lot, in June, 1846, for wheat. 
 The field was plow ed but once, and cultivated several 
 times previous to sowing the wheat. I am not able 
 to give the result accurately, in consequence of cut- 
 ting the grain with a reaper, by which, I was unalde 
 to keep the wheat separate. The difference was quite 
 perceptible at the time of harvesting ; it stood thick- 
 er on the ground, and the berry was of a better 
 quality than the adjoining, on ground not subsoiled. 
 In May last, I subsoiled one and a-half acres for 
 corn, in a field containing six acres. It had been a 
 timothy meadow for four years. The soil was clay 
 loam, subsoil a tenacious clay ; a part of the subsoil- 
 ed ground was a swale previously ditched, a part was 
 a ridge, the balance a wet swale, with a compact, 
 impervious subsoil. Twenty loads of unfermented 

manure was applied to the acre. It was plowed in 
 May five inches deep, and subsoiled nine inches more. 
 I saw no dilBFerence in the corn until August, which 
 was then very perceptible during the drouth of that 
 month. The corn upon the subsoiled part retained all 
 its beautiful freshness, bearing a healthy perpendic- 
 ular tassel, and having the appearance through the 
 day of having been refreshed with a shower of rain 
 the previous evening. That on the unsubsoilcdparts 
 yielded to the drouth, the tassels drooped and the 
 leaves became dry and rolled. After an examination 
 of the soil and subsoil about this time, with the spade, 
 the difference in the parts became no longer a mystery. 
 The earth was moist on the subsoiled portion, 
 within a fourth of an inch of the surface ; on the un- 
 subsoiled it was dry, to the depth of an inch, the bal- 
 ance below dryer than the former. In the one, the 
 subsoil was filled with corn roots in search of food 
 and -vyater ; in the other they were turned aside by 
 the .-ubsoil. The corn on the wet swale was as good 
 if not better than any other portion of the field. 
 Judging from the present crop, I am of opinion that 
 subsoiling this wet swale was an advantage to the 
 crop of one hundred per cent., notwithstanding the 
 objection raised by some, to subsoiling wet land with- 
 out ditching. 
 In consequence of an experiment by which I wished 
 to test two varieties of corn, Avhich crossed the field 
 in an opposite direction to that of subsoiling, I only 
 compared three rows of shocks, five rows in each 
 shock, each row of shocks gathered from twenty-one 
 rods of ground. The result was as follows : 

No. 1, not subsoiled, gave - - - 606 lbs. of ears. 
 " 2, 3 rows subsoiled, 2 rows not, 646 " " 

" 3, subsoiled, 676 " 

The subsoiled gave at the rate of 73 bushels to 
 the acre ; that not subsoiled, 65 bushels per acre : a 
 difference sufficient to pay for subsoiling. I consid- 
 ered the subsoiled part as having been previously 
 inferior for corn. I aimed to be accurate ; if there 
 was any difference in the previous condition of the 
 soil, or in estimating the results of the experiment, 
 it was in favor of the unsubsoiled portion. From the 
 observation of the effects of subs(jiling, so far as it 
 has been practiced by myself and others, my mind 
 has become settled in the conviction that subsoil 
 plowing upon most, if not all of the land of this 
 county, will prove very beneficial for corn and all 
 crops usually raised by us. 

I may be mistaken, but I fully believe, that sub- 
 soiling, thoroughly performed, will prove more profit- 
 able to farmers for the outlay than any other one im- 
 provement. I have never anticipated much improve- 
 ment from it, until after one crop of clover. Then I 
 expect a complete preparation of the soil for wheat. 
 It is unnecessary for me to describe with what ease 
 a clover root will penetrate the loosened subsoil, and 
 even go further in search of food, gaining strength 
 with every additional inch of depth, bringing the 
 salts of the lower strata to the surface for its use, 
 and afi'ording b}' its decay, when tui'ned under by the 
 plow, rich stores of food for wheat. In conclusion, 
 I would recommend subsoiling in the spring and fall, 
 or wiien the ground is wet sufficiently deep, at any 
 time in the summer. It does well for a summer fal- 
 low, if broken up early. It is beneficial to any crop. 
 The expense is aljout the same as for breaking up sod 
 ground. And finally, if this short and imperfect es- 
 .say shall persuade one farmer of this county to prac- 
 tice deep tillage with subsoiling, the object or the 
 writer will be attained. — N. Y. State Agricultural
