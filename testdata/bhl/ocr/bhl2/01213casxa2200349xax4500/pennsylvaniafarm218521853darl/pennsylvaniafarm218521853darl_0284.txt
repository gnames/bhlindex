CHOOSING MILCII COWS— FOWL FEVER. 

December, 

eight orders of the class. Each class possesses marks 
 differing in shape and size irom those of the other 
 classes; and tliese marks are easy to distinguish, on 
 mei'ely looking at them. In each class, the cows of 
 the first orders are the best of the class, and the 
 yield of milk is in proportion to the order ; so that 
 the two higher orders are the most productive, the 
 third and fourth orders tolerably good, and the oth- 

ers fiiUing off more and 

more, according 

to their 

grade. 

M. Guenon applied his system, in our presence, to 
 a number of cows which were presented to him a 
 second time : he made us remark their various signs, 
 which differed in size and shape, and were larger or 
 smaller, according as the cow was a good or bad 
 milker. He informed us that his system is equally 
 applicable to young animals, and that their future 
 qualities in regard to the production of milk can be 
 judged of with equal certainty. In corroboration 
 of this, he caused us to notice the same signs upon 
 calves three or four months old, and also upon bulls 
 destined for the next covering season. The cowherds 
 stated that the calves which had been assigned by 
 him to the first orders were from cows that gave a 
 great deal of milk. Upon two splendid bulls, of the 
 fine breed of Salers, which were of the same age, 
 and exactly alike in hair and size, M. Gu6non pass- 
 ed very different judgments; the one he pronounced 
 good, and assigned to the first order of his Flanders 
 class ; the other he pronounced bad, and assigned 
 to the fifth order of the Horizontal class.* He justi- 
 fied these judgments by very precise comparisons, 
 and made us remark the difference that existed in 
 the signs of the two animals. 

This day, the 26th of May, M. Guenon has made 
 new experiments at the Cattle Fair of the town of 
 Aurillac, in presence of several members of the Cen- 
 tral Agricultural Society, and of the Sub-Societies, 
 and of a great number of land-owners and agricul- 
 turists of Cantal and the neighboring Departments. 

The following is the manner in which your Com- 
 mittee have thought proper to proceed. Each cow 
 was examined separately by M. Guenon, who wrote 
 his notes upon her, and delivered the paper closed, 
 to one of us. Immediately after, another member 
 of the Committee questioned the owner of the cow, or 
 the person in charge of her, in regard to her daily 
 yield of milk, its quality, and the time during which 
 she continued to give milk after being got with calf 
 The answers were taken down in writing, and then 
 compared with the notes written by M. Guenon. 
 They were generally found to accord, and proved, to 
 the satisfaction of your Committee and of every one 
 present — all of whom attended with lively interest to 
 these proceedings — that M. Guenon possesses great 
 sagacity in judging of cattle, and that his method 
 rests upon a sure foundation. 

An incident occurred to confirm us in thisopinion. 
 A farmer played the trick of bringing up for exami- 
 nation a cow that had already been examined and 
 pronounced upon. The notes written by M. Guenon 
 on this occasion, accorded exactly, in every respect, 
 with those he had written on the former. 

The method of M. Guenon has not the merit of 
 being a brilliant theory. It rests upon facts and long 
 experience. It is only after repeated trials, and twen- 
 ty-five years of toilsome researches, that its author 
 has accomplished the task of establishing it. 

We are of opinion, gentlemen, that M. Guenon 
 ought to be encouraged by you in the publication of 
 a system which appears to us destined to exercise a 
 happy influence on the advancement of one of the 
 most important branches of rural economy. What 

immense advantages may there not result, particu- 
 larly in Auvergne, where the raising of cattle and 
 the manufacture of cheese constitute the chief branch 
 of industry, from a method which should enablq us 
 to distinguish, in a sure way, between good and bad 
 cows? By applying this system to calves and to 
 bulls, our stock would rapidly be raised to a high 
 point of excellence, and we should soon have in our 
 mountains none but cows of the best kind. 

In view of all these considerations, your Committee 
 have the hcmor to propose — 

1st. That there be awarded to M. Guenon, a gold 
 medal, with the effigy of Olivier de Serres. 

2nd. Tliat he be proclaimed a corresponding mem- 
 ber of the Societt/. 

3rd. To subscribe for tweniyfive copies of his icork, 
 for distribution among the Sub- Societies of the depart- 
 ment. 

4th. To cause this Report to be inserted in the Ag- 
 ricultural Propagator, and to transmit a copy to 
 all the Prefects and Agricultural Societies of France.

The Fowl Fever. 

It would seem by the following paragraphs, which 
 we extract from the New England Cultivator, that 
 the fowl fever has by no means abated : — 

At the late Boston fowl exhibition, in September, 
 three "Cochin Chinas" were sold at $100! A pair of 
 grey Chittagongs at $50! Two Canton Chinese fowls 
 at $80! The grey Shanghse chicks at $75! Three 
 white Shanghses at $64! Six white Shanghse chick- 
 ens $40 to $45; and these prices, for similar samples, 
 could now be obtained, again and again. 

Within three months extra samples of two years 
 old fowls, of the large Chinese varieties, have been 
 sold for $100 the pair ! ! Several pairs, within our 
 own knowledge, have commanded $50 a pair within 
 the past six months. Last week, we saw a trio of 
 white Shanghses sold in Boston for $44. And the 
 best specimens of Shanghces and Cochin China fowls 
 now being $20 to $25 a pair, readily, to purchasers 
 at the South and West. 

These prices do not equal, however, the sums which 
 have been recently obtained in England for fancy 
 fowls. The Cottage Gardner says: 

Within the last few weeks, a gentleman near Lon- 
 don has sold a pair of Cochin China fowls for 30 
 guineas, ($150) and another pair for 38 guineas, 
 $190. He has been offered £20 for a single hen; has 
 sold numerous eggs for one guinea, ($5) each, and 
 has been paid down for chickens just hatched, 12 
 guineas, ($60) the half dozen, to be delivered a 
 month old. One amateur alone has paid upwards of 
 £100 for stock birds. 

Jd^" Over thirty tons of Eggs were brought into 
 Sandusky, Ohio, on Thursday last, on the Sandusky, 
 Mansfield and Newark railroad. The Register learns 
 that they were all from one point, viz: Mansfield.
