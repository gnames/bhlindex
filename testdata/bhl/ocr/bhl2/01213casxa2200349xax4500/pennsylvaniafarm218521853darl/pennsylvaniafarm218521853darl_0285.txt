Taste of Turnips in Butter. 

About six or seven years ago, I saw it stated in a 
 provincial newspaper, to feed cows with turnips im- 
 mediately after being milked, and on no account to 
 give them any a short time before milking, prevent- 
 ed the milk or butter from tasting of turnips. The 
 method I pursue is this: Immediately after being 
 milked in the morning, they get as many turnips 
 as they can eat. During the day they are fed on hay, 
 and immediately after milking at night they get the 
 same quantity of turnips. The milk and butter are 
 very much admired by all who take them, both for 
 color and flavor, and I have often been called upon 
 to give a statement of our feeding by visitors. I 
 have several times given the cows turnips a short 
 time before being milked, just to prove the thing. On 
 such occasions the milk and butter tasted strongly 
 of tui-nips — [Gard. Chron.

At a Pomological meeting during the late State 
 Fair at Utica, and attended by Barry, Thomas, Ho-

 Growers, the following list was voted, as having prov-

 for Quince Culture, the varieties named, being both 
 vigorous and productive on that stock.

Cut Hay for Milch Cows. 

We copy from the New England Farmer, an exper- 
 iment by William S. Lincoln, on feeding the above : 

"My milking stock consisted of one cow, which 
 came in the 29th of last October, the two trial cows, 
 and one other which calved last April, and which is 
 expected to calve again the first of next April. Some 
 Some time before commencing this experiment, I was 
 feeding my stock — what would be called poor stock — 
 with hay, with an allowance of roots. I commenced 
 cutting this hay for all my stock, young and old, 
 (sixteen head,)occupyingme onehour and-a-half daily. 
 Almost simultaneously with feeding the cut hay was 
 an increase of milk very perceptible as it was milked 
 in the pail. An inquiry was made by my wife, who 
 in person takes sole charge of the dairy, as to the 
 cause of this increase. An evasive reply was made. 
 From day to day, the milk increased enough from the 
 stock I have described, to require the substitution of 
 6 qt. for 4qt. pans, which had been previously used. 
 I think I am within bounds in saying the increase 
 was over a pint daily, per cow, occcasioned, to the 
 best of my knowledge, solely by the use of cut hay."

 PHItADEtPHIA SURROUNDINGS. 

As long ago as one can remember, when a stranger 
 visited our city, his friends made it a point to drive 
 with him to the Woodlands, as one of the most at- 
 tractive spots in our vicinity. Fair-Mount and Laur- 
 el-IIill did not then possess their present attractions. 
 Girard College had not been dream'd of, and Bar- 
 tram's Garden had fallen out of mind, except with 
 the scientific few. 

Recently Dr. Dailington's book has awakened 
 public atttention to the spot which Bartram's name 
 and the visit of St. John De Cravecoeur make clas- 
 sical; and the estate of the Hamilton's after being 
 long neglected, has, under the good-taste and good 
 auspices of the Cemetery Company, had its beauties 
 developed, cultivated and improved, until it promises 
 to become one of our finest specimens of Landscape 
 Gardening. 

As the season of the year is with us, when such 
 places appear most interesting to all whose evening 
 sun verges to its Occident, let us take a glance at 
 them. 

After crossing the Permanent Bridge, turning south 
 from West Philadelphia, you find yourself on the 
 Plank road leading to Darby, and if it be in the even 
 tide of the year, soon come to where the falling leaves 
 say to you — memenfomori — It is"the Woodlands." and 
 as you drive through those pleasant grounds the in- 
 stincts of your nature re-echo the ever recurrino^ — 
 sisto viator. You have again and again to improve 
 these solemn injunctions — and admire the beauties 
 around you. Your thoughts, if rightly trained, af- 
 ter looking down, looking around and looking within, 
 are led to look up. Perhaps you may say to yourself, 
 well, after all these tasteful and beautiful memorials 
 of the dead, a simple green turf is the covering which 
 our mouldering clay should most covet for its narrow- 
 house surrounded by all that is alive and beautiful; 
 there is then no sculptured marble to awaken envy, or 
 eulogistic epitaphs to provoke inquisition, when "cor- 
 ruption says to the worm thou art ray mother." 
 Should surviving friends wish a more certain index 
 to the spot where your bones repose, let it be in the 
 simplest form possible, of some enduring material, 
 with an equally simple Hie Jacet. 

Eequiscai in Pace. 

What with the "eventide of the year," the wood- 
 lands is now peculiarly attractive as a last resting 
 place for the poor body when done with life. 

Leaving the woodlands, to find the old Bartram 
 Place, turn to the left a little below the "Sorrel 
 Horse" — crossing the railroad on a bridge where the 
 cutting must be at least thirty feet deep, and you find 
 yourself on the spot. Much of the original Bartram
