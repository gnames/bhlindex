December, 

Garden is on the vrcst of the railroad, which, in fact, 
 passes through near the middle of it. The original 
 dwelling-house is quite elevated. The moment you 
 enter the premises, through a gate, about one eighth 
 of a mile from the great southern road, the trees, 
 shrubs and plants all indicate that you arc approach- 
 ing classic ground; indeed, the double row of ancient 
 catalpas, one on either side of you, on leaving the 
 main highway, tells you the same thing, before reach- 
 ing the gate. "Walking over the grounds, the first 
 thing which surprises you is their extent. Your next 
 surprise will be at the vast number of interesting 
 trees, of an age and character indicating that Bar- 
 tram himself had planted and trained them — some of 
 prodigious size, some very rare, and many of extra- 
 ordinary beauty — the evergreens, particularly, loom 
 trp and attract jon. There, too, close by the 
 south east corner of the old mansion, stands the La 
 dy Petre Pear tree, with its thousand interesting as- 
 sociations. The present proprietor is entitled to the 
 public thanks for the genteel courtesy with which he 
 80 cheerfully accords to strangers permisson to range 
 over thesf interesting grounds, and for the facilities 
 which he has provided. All the most interesting 
 trees and plants are labelled in a fair hand, conspic- 
 uously, in a way to indicate both their botanical 
 character, and the name by wliich they are general- 
 ly known; His arrangements and improvements are 
 all in excellent good taste, presenting these interest- 
 ing memories of John Bartram to the best advan- 
 tage — bringing them out and not hiding them. The 
 walks, and seats and arbors, which every where 
 abound, combine true luxury, with a neatness and 
 simplicity which can hardly be surpassed. Every 
 where, you see evidence of the beftt care-taking, and 
 of an occupant who understands a'nd appreciates the 
 unrivalled precious things in the productions of moth- 
 er earth, of which he has become the proprietor ; and 
 the interesting associations connected with them, the 
 world over. There presents itself to you the verita- 
 ble mansion built by John Bartram's own hands, 
 (where Jowan Alexidouitz dined with him,) vener- 
 able for its age, but still solid, with scarce an indica- 
 tion of decay. Its window-frames carved out of solid 
 stone, while the pillars, and wide steps, and pave- 
 ment of the portico, are of the same enduring matg. 
 rial. The magnificent vines which cover its entire 
 front, add i\\Q picturesque to the double reality of its 
 green old age. Long may Mr. Eastwick's life be 
 spared, to keep alive as he does, every thing connectr 
 ed with the name of John Bartram, in the same taste- 
 ful, judicious and magnificent way with which he 
 has commenced. 

He is building for himself a residence upon eleva- 
 ted ground, entirely without the original premises 
 cultivated by Bartram as his garden. The traveller 
 has a glimpse of it in passing, by railroad. This 
 building is of an extent and style of finish, novel, cu- 

rious, and highly ornamental in its architecture, in 
 its tower and cupola, and in the character of the pre- 
 parations making for what are to be its surroundings, 
 which might, possibly, excite the envy of our million- 
 aires towards any other than a Philadelphia handi- 
 craf.s-man, whoso industry, energy, enterprize and 
 ingenuity have won from the Emperor of all the 
 Russias, the ample means which enable him to do so 
 much for the adornment of our own winding river, 
 and add new attractions to the many already exist- 
 ing in that interesting locality. 

Should these jottings down of a correspondent not 
 prove too deeply tinged by the influences of the "sere 
 and yellow leaf," nor yet again by devoted attach- 
 ment to the name of Bartram and the Horticulture 
 he left behind him, they are at your service.

 Additional Remarks ou the use of I<ime. 

Every reader of your valuable Journal must have 
 been pleased with the article in the November num- 
 ber, by Mr. G. Blight Browne: "on the theory of the 
 action of lime in agriculture." 

The views which he there gives are imexceptiona- 
 bly correct; and given in so short and clear a man- 
 ner that its perusal cannot be sufSciently recommend- 
 ed to all those who desire to have their ideas settled 
 on this subject. 

Most of the injurious efiects experienced from over- 
 doses of lime, must undoubtedly be ascribed to its be 
 ing used in the caustic state, or in that state in which 
 it exists immediately after being slacked; instead of 
 being firs* allowed to become perfectly carbonated by 
 sufficient exposure to the air. In the former case, if 
 slacked by water, it consists entirely of a combination 
 of lime and water, called the hydrate of lime, and if 
 air-slacked, of the same compound, with more or less 
 carbonate of lime. The hydrate of lime, in either 
 case, possesses strong basic or alkaline properties, by 
 which, as Mr Browne says, "if applied in doses a- 
 bove the amount necessary to saturate the acids in 
 the soil, it will prey upon the humus, to the damage ot 
 the growing crop," and even with Mr. Gowen's words, 
 "when his allotted means fail to appease his growing 
 appetite he icillfeed on the plants themselves." In the 
 latter case, after sufSciently long exposure to the air, 
 it is converted entirely into carbonate of lime, that is, 
 a combination of lime and carbonic acid, which has 
 none of the alkaline properties of the hydrate of lime, 
 but is earthy and neutral both in taste and other 
 properties, and may therefore be applied in almost 
 any quantity with impunity. 

What I would particularly point out in connection 
 with this matter, as it probably is the true cause o* 
 the different results obtained by diflerent experimen- 
 ters, is the different facility with which dlS'erent va 
 rietien of limo absorb carbonic acid from the air, and
