PRIZE ESSAY— ON ABORTION IN COWS. 

Abortion (from Aborior, to be barren) is the term 
 used to imply expulsion of the contents of the gravid 
 uteras of any animal before the usual period of 
 gestation is completed. This period, or time inclu- 
 ded between the process of fruitful connection of the 
 fem.ile with the male, and the act of natural parturi- 
 tion or birth of the young, differs in duration in va- 
 rious animals. In the cow the time of gestation is 
 commonly considered to be forty weeks. Much differ- 
 ence, however, is seen to exist in various cows; it is 
 no unusual circumstance for some to exceed this 
 period by one, two, or,even three weeks, and for others 
 to calve ten days or a fortnight before its expiration; 
 all these variations being perferctly consistent with 
 health both of mother and young. 

M. Tessier, in a report founded on forty years' ob- 
 servation, and presented to the Royal Academy of 
 Paris, says, that in 1131, cows which he observed, 
 the longest period of gestation was 321 days, or for- 
 ty-six weeks within one day; that out of 577 individ- 
 uals no fewer than 20 calved beyond the 298th day, 
 and that the shortest period was 240 days. Earl 
 Spencer, in the * 'Journal of the Royal Agricultural 
 Society of England" for 1839, considers the average 
 period of gestation, as noticed in 764 individual cows, 
 to be 284 or 285 days; but 210 calved after the 285th 
 day, three went to the 306th day, and one to the 
 313th. A cow pregnant with a male calf is more 
 likely to exceed the 40 weeks than she is with a fe- 
 male. This is shown in Earl Spencer's observations; 
 he found that among calves born between the 290th 
 and 300th day, there was a preponderance of males 
 in the proportion of 74 males to 32 females. It has 
 been found in the human female, as well as in the 
 cow, that the period of the first gestation is frequent- 
 ly shorter in duration than subsequent ones. This 
 probably depends on the uterus of a young female 
 not being adapted for that amount of expansion of 
 which it is rendered capable by repeated pregnancy. 
 Calves born before the end of the seventh month sel- 
 dom survive, even if born alive, and it is rarely desi- 
 rable that they should live if born before the end of 
 the eighth month, as their weakness and diminutive 
 size render them comparatively valueless. 

Although abortion is the term which the profes- 
 sional man employs to signify a premature expulsion 
 of the uterine contents, yet, as applying to the cow, 
 numerous other names are in daily popular use to 
 sigify this condition. Some of the most common are 
 these: — Slipping calf, slinking calf, picking calf, 
 casting calf, and icarping. 

Abortion in a cow may take place at any period of 

testation, but is most common between the 9th and 
 5th week. It may occur before the germ or ovum, 
 from which the future animal is formed, has assumed 
 any of it permanent characters, and when it is so mi- 
 nute and cellular in structure as to be hardly observ- 
 able to the naked eye. It maj'' also take place when 
 the embryo, or first rudimentary animal outline, is 
 barely recognised among the contents of the uterus, 
 and it may be deferred till the various members and 
 organs of the foetal body have attained more perfect 
 development. In the human female, if this expulsion 
 take place during the first sixteen weeks of gestation, 
 it is called abortion; if between the sixteenth and 
 twenty-eighth, it is termed miscarriage; if between tlie 
 twenty-eighth week and the full period, it is consider- 
 ed premature labour. This distinction in terms is 
 not observed in reference to the lower animals. 

Ettcnt of the Prevalence of Abortion. — From vari- 
 ous inquiries which have been made, and from the 

statements of travellers and other persons competent 
 to speak on the subject, it seems that among the vast 
 herds of wild cattle inhabiting the large tracts of 
 country on the continents of the old and new world, 
 abortion is unknown. In those mountainous districts 
 of our own country which we have visited, more es- 
 pecially in Wales and Scotland, where small black 
 cattle (although domesticated) are less artificially 
 treated than the cows of richer districts in other 
 parts of the kingdom, abortion, except as an acciden- 
 tal circumstance, is almost unheard of. It is also in- 
 teresting to notice, that the pregnant human female, 
 although exposed to the apparent hardships and dis- 
 comfort of a savage life, is very rarely subject to a- 
 bortion. Women, too, in our own and other countries, 
 in the lower ranks of civilized society, are, on the 
 whole, infinitely less liable to abortion than those 
 of their sex who participate fully in the luxuries and 
 artificial refinements of life. These facts are of great 
 interest, and, as we shall presently find, although 
 they do not prove what the causes of abortion are, 
 3'et, on the other hand, they instructively show(what 
 is of great value in medical evidence) that while one 
 class of animals is exempt from the operation of the 
 causes in question, we must expect to find that such 
 causes act, and are to be found in special connection 
 with some peculiar conditions under which the affect- 
 ed animals are placed. 

In every season, and under every variety of cir- 
 cumstance, there are occasional cases of abortion met 
 with in particular stocks of cows; but if there be a 
 continued recurrence of this year after year in the 
 same place, (as is, unhappily, often the case,) we 
 may generally find it connected with some local 
 cause. A cow which has cast her calf one season, 
 is very likely do the same in the pregnancy or year 
 succeeding. If several cows among a stock have cast 
 nearly at the same time, and if, on again becoming 
 pregnant, they are allowed to remain together and in 
 company with other pregnant cows, it very general- 
 ly happens that for the most part they not only abort 
 again, but more of their companions, advanced to a- 
 bout the same period of gestation, will slip calf like- 
 wise. Next year, if no precautions are taken, mat- 
 ters become worse; and in a few seasons more, abor- 
 tion, to a destructive and uncontrollable extent,is the 
 pest of the farm. Where this state of things has ex- 
 isted for years together, it is not an uncommon cir- 
 cumstance to find that the farmer will entertain the. 
 the most absurd opinions regarding its causes and 
 continuance. As a means of prevention, he will nail 
 h'Tse shoes over the doors of his cow houses; bury 
 the aborted calves with great ceremony, and under- 
 the observance of mysterious incantations; keep goats, 
 among his stock, or not allow his cows to take bulL 
 unless under a favorable "sign of the moon." A maa^ 
 wiio has observed a disease making yearly a steady- 
 arid destructive progress among his cattle, wiio nev- 
 er adopts a single effective precaution which science 
 and right reason suggest to prevent its extension, is 
 just the person to fall a victim to dangerous,aud even 
 superstitious ideas. 

Abortion occurs among animals of all ages, and 
 though sometimes most common in those pregnant 
 the first time, it is on the wiiole, (juite as frequent a- 
 mong cows which have had two or three calves. An 
 animal which does not become in calf until she is 
 four or five years of age, is more subject to abortion 
 than if she took the bull earlier. liakewell, the em- 
 inent breeder, was in the halMt of delaying putting 
 his cows to the bull until they were three years old, 
 and manv of them failed to carry their calves. (See
