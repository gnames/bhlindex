ABORTION IN COWS. 

OEcfiafit's- 

for months together have repeatedly failed to con- 
 ceive, i.lthough they have been regularly in heat and 
 have had connection with the male, are very liable to 
 abortion on conception taking place. 

"When a cow has taken the bull, and conception 
 follows, the oestrum, or heat, soon passes away, and 
 she settles down, to manifest no return of sexual ap' 
 petite during pregnancy. Some striking exceptions 
 to this rule, are, however, found, for we have known 
 cows, although in calf, display a desire for the male. 

The calves of some of the more primitive breeds 
 of cattle in this and other countries, are, at birth, 
 small in size when compared with some of those 
 borne by our ^'improved" animals. The milk yielded 
 by the native breeds, such as those inhabiting high 
 land districts in this kingdom, is comparatively small 
 in quantity, but rich in quality. These cows gener- 
 ally pass through the periods of gestation and partu- 
 rition with immunity from many diseases to which 
 higher-bred animals are during such times especially 
 liable, and for the most part bring forth their young 
 without that mechanical assistance which we are in 
 the habit of affording to the short-horned cattle. It 
 has, however, been found that, in order to keep pace 
 with the interests of the age, in a commercial, econ- 
 omical, and scientific point of view, the ingenuity of 
 man might be profitably turned to what is called the 
 improvement of breeds of cattle. The objects aim- 
 ed at in effecting this end are, by judicious admix- 
 ture of animals, to produce such stock as, combining 
 excellence of external form with milking and feeding 
 properties,8hall be most valuable for the requirements 
 of mankind. Any animal that is readily domesticat- 
 ed, and adapts itself to what may be called artificial 
 modes of life, is, in the course of years, under the 
 hands of man, made subject to important modifications 
 of external form, accompanied by intrinsic constitu- 
 tional changes. The cow affords an instructive il- 
 lustration of this fact; and while we can but confess 
 that some diseases effect our improved cattle, which 
 seldom occur among indigenous breeds, yet we must 
 also admit the great national advantage of that prac- 
 tical application of the science of breeding, which 
 has produced our choice animals of the present day. 

Symptoms op Abortion. 

If abortion take place in the early weeks of preg- 
 nancy, it is but rarely that any symptoms are observ- 
 ed which foretell its occurrence. The speedy return 
 of oestrum, however, soon makes the farmer aware 
 that the contents of the uterus have been expelled. 
 It is an interesting fact, and one worthy of attention, 
 that the sooner abortion occurs after conception, 
 the sooner also does oestrum succeed the abor- 
 tion. In some cases the two conditions appear to go to- 
 gether; and we shall often find, on observation, that 
 the periods of abortion correspond pretty closely with 
 â€¢what would be the periods of recurring heat if the 
 animal were not pregnant. Thus a cow will often a- 
 bort at the end of the third, sixth, ninth, twelfth 
 week, and so on; but except from accidental causes, 
 she does not so frequently abort in the intermediate 
 periods. 

If abortion take place within two or three months 
 of the natural period of gestation, it is denoted by 
 symptoms which, although modified, resemble those 
 indicating ordinary parturition. If it occur before 
 the expiration of the third month, the system of the 
 cow will not suffer much derangement; but if it hap- 
 pen at such an advanced stage of gestation as the 
 eixth or seventh month, it is productive of serious in- 
 jury, and frequently of great danger to the constitu- 
 tion and even life of the parent. 

Before every act of abortion, and at whatever pe- 
 riod it occurs, except, perhaps, before the third or 
 fourth week of gestation, there is a discharge of 
 brown glairy fluid and mucus from the organs of gen- 
 eration. If the embryo about to be expelled be very 
 small, this discharge may be so limited in quantity 
 as entirely to escape ordinary notice, and on that ac- 
 count it is highly important to be acquainted with 
 the appearances which it presents. At first it is 
 brown in colour, and of sufficiently thick consistence 
 to hang in slimy strings from the vulva. Afterwards 
 in consequence of containing a quantity of blood, and 
 possibly liquor amnii, it becomes thinner and redder 
 in colour. The discharge is caivsed by a breach of 
 the natural connections between the foetal membranes 
 and uterus, in consequence of which the fluid con- 
 tents of these organs, after escaping into the uterine 
 cavity, are thence expelled. During pregnancy, al- 
 most all cows have other occasional discharges from 
 the organs of generation, which must be distinguish- 
 ed from that just mentioned, inasmuch as their ap- 
 pearances are perfectly consistent with health. They 
 consist of a thick, colourless, transparent, and almost 
 inodorous secretion, sometimes very copiously sup- 
 plied by certain parts of the vagina and uterus in 
 the vicinity of the os uteri, and by their consistence 
 and tenacity assist in retaining the organ in a closed 
 condition. 

If the cow about to cast calf be in pasture, she 
 may seek to be alone, but on the whole she is not so 
 secluded in her habits as when at the full time of 
 gestation. Cows in the same stock will also smell 
 at her, as though some peculiar odor attracted their 
 notice. If advanced five or six months in gestation, 
 there is a sudden and slight enlargement of the ud- 
 der; and if she be yielding milk at the time, it will 
 be yellower in colour and greater in quantity than 
 before. The external organs of generation become 
 enlarged and loose in appearance, the ligaments 
 which connect the sacrum (rump bone) with the 
 bones on each side (ischia) are relaxed, but not near- 
 ly to the same extent as before healthy parturition. 
 In young animals pregnant for the first time, and a- 
 bout to abortjuone of the foregoing symptoms (except 
 the discharge) are so plainly seen; in fact they are 
 seldom detected by those in ordinary attendance on 
 cattle. Hemorrhage, (or copious flooding of blood,) 
 although so frequent and dangerous a precursor of a- 
 bortion in the human being, is not common in cat- 
 tle. 

The above symptoms may require a few days for 
 their development, or they may be prolonged over a 
 week or more; but if the peculiar discharge contin- 
 ues, and increases in quantity, we may be certain 
 that abortion is at hand. The immediate approach 
 of the event is shown by the animal becoming evi- 
 dently, uneasy, by her shifting from place to place, 
 resting alternately on one hind foot and then the oth- 
 er, twisting the tail, lying down and speedily rising, 
 arching the back and straining, quickened breathing, 
 and accelerated circulation. The symptoms and pro- 
 cess of abortion generally occupy less time and at- 
 tract less notice than those accompanying healthy 
 parturition. 

When abortion is caused by mechanical injuries, 
 such as blows, strains in leaping, concussion in run- 
 ning, and so forth, the foetus is suddenly passed into 
 the neck of the uteras and vagina, and retained 
 there several days. During this period, especially 
 the early part of it, the cow is continually straining 
 and suffers a great amount of irritative fever. In 
 some instances part of the foetus, as its head, neck, 
 or legs, will protrude from the vulva throughout the
