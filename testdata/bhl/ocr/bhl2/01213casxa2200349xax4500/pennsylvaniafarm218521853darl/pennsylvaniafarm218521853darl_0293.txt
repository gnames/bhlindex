may be found about the farm, such as refuse straw 
 and corn stalks not used for bending, weeds, potato 
 tops, turf or sods, leaves whenever they can be con- 
 verted into the foods of plants, should be carefully 
 husbanded, to add to the produce of the farni. Proj> 
 er attention to this is the very starting post in good 
 farming, and will enable a farmer to nearly double 
 the average quantity of his crops per acre, with the 
 same amount of labor as before given. 

Liquid Manures.— This part consisting mostly of 
 the urine of cattle and horses, is, by farmers gener- 
 ally allowed to run to waste, being considered but of 
 little account. In Flanders, where are found the 
 best farmers in the world, the urine of a cow is con- 
 sidered worth $10 a year, so highly is it esteemed. 
 It is found that there is voided by a cow in a year 
 13,000 lbs. of urine, of which 900 lbs. is solid mat- 
 ter, 400 urea, a substance yielding a large quantity 
 of ammonia, and 230 ammonia. {Johnston.) 'The 
 urine of the cow has been analyzed in several States 
 by Sprengel, with the following results in 1,000 parts: 

Water, 926,2 Urea, 400,00 

Ilippuric & lactic acid; 6,1 Mucus, 2,00 

Carbonic acid, 2,1 Ammonia, 2,1 

Potash, 6,6 Soda, 5,5 

Sulphuric acid, 4,0 Phosphoric acid, 0,7 

Chlorine, 2,7 Lime, 0,6 

Magnesia, 0,4 Silica, 0,4 

Alumnia, oxide of iron and oxide of icanganesa, 0,1 

Here then, every farmer who keeps a cow or an 
 ox, can have a manure equal in value to the best of 
 the much lauded guano, if he will only take the 
 proper steps to preserve it from waste; and estimated 
 at the value of guano, would be worth, if the whole 
 could be saved, §20 a year. 

It being evident that the urine of animals Is quite 
 as valuable as the solid excrements, the next step is 
 to preserve it from waste. Something must be used 
 to take it up and hold it in suspension. For this 
 purpose, black mould swamps and the muck from 
 marshes must be our main dependence. In truth, 
 we need desire nothing better. The former is fit for 
 use as soon as obtained, but the latter needs to be 
 dug and exposed a year, to the action of air and frost 
 to fit it completely for use. Those muck beds which 
 are formed by deposits from the annual overflow of 
 rivers, are generally fit for use after an exposure of 
 a month or two. But it would be better to use fresh 
 muck even for the absorption of liquid manures, 
 than to allow them to run off and waste. There is 
 however, ordinarily no necessity for this. Muck 
 may be decomposed in four to six weeks, by a very 
 simple process. Take three bushels of quick lime, 
 fresh from the kiln, and one bushel of salt, or in this 

{)roportion. Dissolve the salt in water and slack the 
 ime with it. Mix thoroughly, turning in every oth- 
 er day for ten days. Then draw up your muck and 
 deposit a layer upon the ground, and give a good 
 sprinkling or the lime ; then another layer of muck, 
 and another sprinkling of lime and so on. A power- 
 ful decomposition will soon ensue. After three or 
 four weeks it may need to be shoveled over, when 
 you will have a fine, black pulverulent mass, which 
 will not only absorb the liquid portions of the ma- 
 nure, but will, itself be the source of some of the 
 most important food of plants. Care must be ob- 

more lime should be added until it is brought into a 
 state fit for use. It should be turned over as before 
 stated, every other day for ten days, and then mixed 
 at the rate of four bushels to the cord. This plan is 
 given by Prof. C. W. Johnson, and it is found to be 
 the most economical and profitabe mode of preparing 
 cold, organic matters, for application to soils." — Am.

I have found lime which is to be 
 used for manure greatly benefitted by slacking it 
 with salt water, and then spread upon the ground in 
 the usual way. I have never seen an article written 
 on this subject; but still it may not be a new idea with 
 me. As you said you would like communications on 
 any form, I therefore take the liberty of sending this, 
 which, if you think worth a place in your Journal^ 
 you are welcome to it. 

I remain in haste.

The great advantage of slacking lime with salt wa- 
 ter, spoken of above, is no new thing. Salt consists 
 of chlorine and soda, and is decomposed by the lime, 
 giving rise to the new compounds, carbonate of soda 
 and chloride of lime. The carbonate of soda .hus 
 formed, has been found very efficacious in soils a- 
 boundingmuch in vegetable matter,which it combines 
 with and renders soluble for the use of plants, and 
 also in the speedy decomposition of inert vegetable 
 substances, such as leaves, corn-stalks, &c. 

Don't Expose your Stock. 

Liebig, the distinguished German Chemist asserts, 
 that "Our clothing is t<t be considered nearly in the 
 light of an equivalent for a certain amount of food." 
 In all situations where the body is kept warm and 
 comfortable by the protection of suitable garments, 
 the demand for food, in order to sustain the natural 
 functions of the system, will be loss than where the 
 protection is scanty, or but ill adapted to subserve 
 the purpose for which it is designed. Now, this ob- 
 servation applies with no less force to the manage- 
 ment of domestic animals, than to the management 
 of ourselves and our children. A cow, forced to 
 stand exposed to the weather in inclement seasons, 
 to repose on the cold ground, or a barn or hovel where 
 the piercing blasts have free access, necessarily re- 
 quires a far larger amount of food than one carefully 
 sheltered and provided with a comfortable stall and 
 bed. The difference in the amount of food consum- 
 ed by animals treated in the different styles above 
 indicated, has been demonstrated by actual and re- 
 peated experiments, to be from twenty-nine to one 
 hundred per cent, in f.ivor of the latter ! But this 
 is not all. Exposure torpifies and emasculates the 
 system, and opens the door for the introduction of 
 many a fearful disease. An animal habitually ex- 
 posed to cold, usually falls away. If a cow, " she 
 shrinks her milk," if an ox, he will experience a loss 
 of vivacity, and become stupid and inert, and but fee- 
 served not to use more water than is necessary to [ bly prepared to answer too exorltitant drafts made 
 dissolve the salt, as the lime will not take up a larg- upon his muscular powers under the j'oke. "A mer- 
 er quantity. In case too much water is applied, ' ciful man is merciful to his beast, "-i^c///7ier<t.4r/'za/i.
