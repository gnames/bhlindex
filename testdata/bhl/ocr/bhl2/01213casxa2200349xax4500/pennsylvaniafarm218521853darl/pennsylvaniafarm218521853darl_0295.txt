[With the'view of keeping the farmers and breed- 
 ers of our own State posted up with respect to tho 
 owners of high-bred stock, and as a matter of refer- 
 ence hereafter in tracing pedigrees; we extract from 
 the Cultivator the account of Vail's cattle sale, near 
 Troy, with prices and names of purchasers. It 
 w'U be seen that several of them are now owned in 
 our own State. The hint thrown out in one of the 
 reports of our State Exhibition, that there should be 
 a State Hen Book, is well worthy of attention. With- 
 out an official register is made and kept of thorough 
 bred stock and their issue, there is constant danger 
 of imposition. Those gentleman who have shown 
 their liberality in purchasing pure bloods, at high 
 prices, are especially interested in this,aud to prevent 
 grades being palmed off under false representations. 
 The present high prices of Durham stock are a groat 
 temptation to this, and it ghould not be forgotten that 
 the only safety of purcha>ers is in a well-authentica- 
 ted pedigree, running back through a line of ancestry 
 sufficiently long to confirm the blood. Many of our 
 grade animals are beautiful in figure, often equal to 
 the thorough bred, but there is no certainty in their 
 ijsue, and they cannot be relied upon for bi*eeding.j
