Method of Curing Prize Hams. 

The following reeeipe for curing prize hams, after 
 the manner practised in Maryland and Virginia, has 
 been published before. It is seasonable again, and 
 its usefulness will commend it to those interested in 
 the kind of knowledge it imparts. 

T. E. IIamhleton's Recipe, 1st Premium. — To ev- 
 ery 100 pounds pork, take 8 pounds of G. A. salt, 2 
 ounces saltpetre, 2 lbs. brown sugar, Ik ounces of 
 potash, and 4 gallons of water. Mix the above, and 
 pour the brine over the meat, after it has laid in the 
 tub some two days. Let the hams remain six weeks 
 in brine, and then be dried several days before smok- 
 ing. 1 have generally had the meat rubbed with 
 tine salt when it is packed down. The meat should 
 be perfectly cool before packing. 

J. Glenn's Recipe, 2nd Premium.— To 100 pounds 
 pork, take half a bushel and half a peck of salt, 3 
 pounds of saltpetre, 3 pounds sugar, and 2 quarts 
 mjlasses. Mix — ^rub the bacon with it well; keep 
 on for three Aveeks in all; but at the end of nine days 
 take out the hams, and put those which were at the 
 top in the bottom. 

R. BuooiiE, Jr.'s Recipe, 3rd Premium.— One 
 bushel line salt, half bushel ground alum salt, one 
 and a half pounds saltpetre to to the thousand pounds 
 pork, left to lie in pickle four weeks, hung up and 
 smoked with hickcry wood until the rind becomes 
 a dark brown. 

C. D. Sunglupf's Recipe, 4th Premium— To 100 
 pounds green hams, take 8 pounds ground allum salt, 
 2 pounds brown sugar, or molasses equivalent, 2 
 ounces saltpetre, 2 ounces pearlash, 4 gallons water ; 
 dissolve well, skimming off the scum arising on the 
 surfiice. Pack the hams compactly in a tight vessel 
 or cask, rubbing the fleshy part with fine salt. In a 
 day or two pour the above pickle over the meat, tak- 
 ing care to keep it covered with the pickle. In four 
 or sixweeks, according to the size and weight of the 
 hams, (that is to say, the longer period for heavy 
 hams,) hang up to smoke, hock up, smoking with 
 green hickory wood. I have put up hams for the 
 last twelve or fifteen years by the above recipe, with 
 uniform success, equal at all times to the sample now 
 presented. 

To the above we add the following, which we, as 
 well as many ot'iers, have very satisfactorily proved : 

For every 100 pounds of meat, take 5 pints of g lod 
 molasses, (or 5 pounds of brown sugar,) 5 ounces 
 saltpetre, and 8 pounds rock salt ; add 3 gallons of 
 water, and boil the ingredients over a gentle fire, 
 skimming off the froth or scum as it rises. Contin- 
 ue the boiling until the salt, &c., is dissolved. Have 
 the hams nicely cut and trimmed, packed in casks 
 with the shank end down, as the pickle will thus 
 strike in better. When the pickle, prepared as above, 
 is cooled to blood heat, pour it over the hams. They 
 may lie in pickle from two to six weeks, according to 
 the sizeof the pieces or the state of the weather, more 
 time being required in cold than in warm weather. 
 Beef or mutton hams intended for smoking and dry- 
 ing, may be cured according to this mode, and will 
 be found excellent. 

_ Much of the goodness of hams depends on smok- 
 ing. They should be hung at such a distance from 
 the fire as not to be heated. They should also be hung 
 up with the shank end downward, as this will pre- 
 vent the escape of their juices by dropping. Small 
 hams, wanted for immediate use, will answer with 
 two weeks' smoking, but larger ones, and those want- 
 ed for keeping, should be smoked four weeks or more. 
 In addition to the above, we add the following. 

which we have tried, and believe to be the best of 
 all, and is quite a common method in Chester county, 
 By it all the juices and virtues of the ham are saved, 
 none absorbed, by the pickle : 

Lay the hams on a plain board, and as an average 
 quantity, but which may be increased or lessened 
 according to size, rub in well, and spread on the sur- 
 face one pint fine allum salt, and one tea-spoonful 
 saltpetre. Nothing more will be required than to let 
 them lay till time to smoke, which will be in six or 
 eight weeks, and hang up with shanke end down. 
 If the salt should be absorbed, some more may be 
 rubbed on. 

The liObos Islands and Guano. 

The following from "Dickens' Household Words," 
 eclipses all previous estimates we have seen as to 
 the amount of Guano at the Lobos Islands. Wheth- 
 er correct or not there is at least no immediate dang- 
 er of the supply running short. Our own difficulties 
 with Peru as to her right to the Islands, which was 
 questioned by the late secretary of State, have been 
 all settled, and her title definitely acknowledged. It 
 is probable the price of Guano, will be about the 
 same as heretofore. 

"The three Islands lie nearly due north, and south 
 the breadth of the passage between them being about 
 a mile in one instance, and two miles in the other. 
 The south island is as yet untouched, and from a vis- 
 it I paid it, I should suppose it to contain more guano 
 than is found in either of the others. The middle is- 
 land, at which we traded, has been moderately work- 
 ed, but the greatest quantity of Guano is taken 
 from the north island. In their general formation 
 the islands are alike. They all rise, on the side 
 next the main land, in a perpendicular wall of rock; 
 from the edge of the precipice, the guano then slopes 
 upwards to the centre of each island, where a pin- 
 nacle of rock rises above the surface; from this point 
 it descends to the sea by a gentle declivity, the guano 
 continuing to within a few feet of the water. Each 
 Island has, at a distance, the appearance of a flatten- 
 ed cone, but they have all been originally broken into 
 rocky hills and valleys. The deposits of guano hav- 
 ing gradually filled up the valleys, and risen above 
 the rocks, the cuttings of the guano diggers vary 
 from a depth of eighty or a hundred feet, to merely 
 a few inches. 

"The guano is regularly stratified; the lower strata 
 are solidified by the weight of the upper, and have 
 acquired a dark red color, which becomes gradually 
 lighter towards the surface. On the surface it has a 
 whitey-brown light crust, very well baked by the sun; 
 it is a crust containing eggs; being completely hon- 
 eycombed by the birds, which scratch deep, oblique 
 holes in it to serve as nests, wherein eggs, saldora 
 more than two to each nest; are deposited. These 
 holes often running into each other, form long galle- 
 ries with several entrances, and this mining system is 
 so elaborately carried out, that you can scarcely put 
 a foot on any part of the Islands without sinking to 
 the knee. 

"Though the Islands are not large — their average 
 circumferance being about two miles — the accumula- 
 tion of guano is almost incredible. Calculations as 
 to the probable quantity must, on account of the va- 
 rying depths of the deposits, be very uncertain. I
