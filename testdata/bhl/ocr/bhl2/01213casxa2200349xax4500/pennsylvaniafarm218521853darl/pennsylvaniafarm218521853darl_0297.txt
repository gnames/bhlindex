remember making an average of the depth, and de- 
 ducting therefrom a rough estimate that the three 
 small Islands alone contain upwards of two hundred 
 and fifty millions of tons of pure guano, which, at 
 the rate of supply which has been going on during 
 the last five or six years, would require about one 
 hundred and eigfhty years for removal, and at its En- 
 glish value — which, after deducting freight, is about 
 j£5 per ton — would be worth twelve hundred and fif- 
 ty millions sterling. This is exclusive of vast quan- 
 tities which have been used by the Peruvians them- 
 selves;" 

WORK FOR THE MONTH. 

Farm. 

Before ground is too frozen, and while teams are in 
 better condition than they will be next Spring, plow 
 and subsoil, especially on heavy lands, the fields 
 for coming crops of corn; attend to stock in barn- 
 yard; provide sheds for shelter; fodder judiciously 
 with straw, corn-fodder, and occasionally hay; re- 
 membering it is easier to keep them in a thriving 
 condition, than to get them into it. Cows and young 
 stock should be well cared for in well ventilated stables. 
 and supplied with a few carrots, bee ts,or turnips each 
 day ; use the card frequently. Have water always at 
 band, and two or three lumps of rock salt in yard 
 for stock at pleasure to lick. Economise hay and straw 
 by use of straw-cutter. Corn fodder should also 
 be cut, before feeding, and if no steamer is at hand, 
 empty the tough end of the stalks, or buts, which will 
 generally be refused by the cattle, into a large hogs, 
 head, into which pour boiling water, and cover the 
 top. After being softened by this process feed, with a 
 little bran or meal sprinkled over. Have manure, as it 
 gathers in barn-yard, collected under a rough shed in 
 centre of yard. Provide some soil, or muck from 
 swamps, which mix through it as heaps is forming, 
 and give occasionally a sprinkle of plaster. Prevent 
 drainage passing off, by collecting liquid in a pit at 
 one end, which should occasionally be pumped up, 
 aud poured or watered over the surface. Manure 
 saved in this way is worth at least fourfold more in 
 spring, than where it is scattered ovor yard, and ex- 
 posed to weather. Collect and house carefully all 
 tools and farming utensils. Open the mouths of drains 
 and ditches. Avoid turning stock into pasture fields 
 in soft weather. Secure corn cribs from mice. Haul fu- 
 el when ground is frozen. Give plenty of litter, either 
 straw or leaves from woods, to all stock, cattle, hors- 
 es, sheep, and swine. For the latter boil small pota- 
 toe"-', pumpkins, and any refuse vegetables. 
 Fruit Orchard. 
 Attend to general directions of last month. Bank 
 up the earth around your trees to keep off mice. Dig 
 in manure, or guano when ground is not frozen. Take 
 advantage of open weather, to prepare for spring 
 planting, by deep yjlowing and subsoiling. Where 
 the object of pruning in young trees is to promote 
 growth, now is the proper time. The amount of fjod 
 collected by roots through winter is thus confined to 

remaining branches, instead of being distributed 
 through tree and lost. 

Flower Garden. 

The principa work for garden in this month, will 
 be cleaning up borders and decayed plants and weeds, 
 renewing walks, tieing up to stakes and protecting 
 half hardy plants and shrubs. Running roses should 
 be secured firmly to their stakes or trellisses, to pre- 
 serve them from being broken by storms. Cliromatel- 
 las, Solfatares and such like, not perfectly hardy, 
 should be well covered with straw or cedar boughs. 
 Teas and other dwarf varieties may be protected 
 with cedar boughs tied together at top. Mulch well 
 all roses and plants with short manure. Tie up juni- 
 pers and other bushes with straggling branches. 

Persons wishing early blooming plants in spring, 
 may keep them through winter in cold frame. Dig 
 out a hole a foot deep of size required, and fit in a. 
 box, sloping to the south if possible, two feet deep at 
 back, and 18 inches in front, bank up earth from 
 the hole on outside, and lay a bed of coal ashes in bot- 
 tom, to make drainage and prevent ingress of worms. 
 Cover with sash, and protect in severe weather with 
 straw mats and shutters. Verbenas, Primrose, Poly- 
 anthus, Pansies, Petunias, &e., will keep nicely in 
 this way, and bloom early. Forward annuals in 
 pots by placing them in frame early in spring. 

See that plants in windows are not killed with 
 watering. The only rule for this is appearance of 
 soil in pots, water only when it appears dry. Keep 
 them near light and turn round occasionally. The 
 farther plants are from light give the less water,changc 
 water in hyacinth glasses, every week or ton days. 
 Vi getable Gardens. 

Attend to directions of last month. Finish cov- 
 ering with straw or litter, everything that needs pro- 
 tection. Commence composting manures, so as to 
 prepare them for spring use. Attend to arranging 
 and securing all such seeds as will be required for 
 spring planting. 

Address to the Farmers of Pennsylvania. 

We, the undersigned, Brewers and Malters of the 
 City and County of Philadelphia, embrace the pres- 
 ent apportunity of offering a few facts for the con- 
 sideration of the Farmers of Pennsylvania, in regard 
 to the demand that exists for Barley, thereby hoping 
 that their attention may be directed to its cultivation. 

Within the county of Philadelphia, there is annu- 
 ally consumed for the purposes of Brewing, about 
 sixhundrcd ihou.mnd hushcls of Barley, supplied 
 from the State of New York, which has sold in Al- 
 bany, its general depot, the past three years at an 
 average price of from seventy- five to ninety cents per 
 bushel, which, by comparison with the prices of oth- 
 er grains within the corresponding period, has yield- 
 ed a much larger profit to the cultivator. The de- 
 mand is continually increasing. About equal quan- 
 tities of the two and four-rowed are used, and the so 
 called spring barley is much preferred to the winter 
 grain for tlie purpose of Malting. 

The State of New York now produces an annual
