is sufficiently gathered, it is taken out and placed on 
 a triangular table — the base of which is lower than 
 the apex — on wliich is placed a fluted cone, having 
 its apex affixed to the apex of the table, after the 
 manner of a ball andsjcket. This cone is rolled 
 over the butter occasionally, turning up the edges 
 until the butter milk is completely worked out. Then 
 the salt is worked in, after which, it is set away in 
 coolers, until the next morning, when it is again tho- 
 roughly worked on the table, weighed in half pound 
 lumps, and printed in a box print. I send my butter 
 to the Baltimore market, where but ten pounds have 
 been sold below 25 cents per lb. this season.

Wai.ker's Method. — This was made in a well ven- 
 tilated milk cellar. The most entire neatness is ob- 
 served in every thing connected with it. The cream 
 skimmed before the milk thickened, stirred frequent- 
 Iv till sufficient to churn, which must done slowly. 
 When well gathered, washed in cold water and salt- 
 ed to the taste. A very little saltpetre added to that 
 designed for keeping. S. M. Walker. 

J. F. Garrard's Metuod. — In compliance with 
 your request, I herewith transmit you the mode ol 
 manufacturing butter, such as exhibited by the un- 
 dersigned. In the lirst place, I would say it was 
 made from six Durham cows in the following manner. 
 The milk, as soon as taken from the cows, is strained 
 into stone milk pans, about four inches deep, where 
 it is allowed to stand twenty four hours ; it is then 
 skimmed with as little milk as possible and put into 
 a stone crock, and kept cool and sweet. When 
 churned, and the milk worked out of it, which is done 
 entirely with the butter paddle, (we do not wash our 
 butter,) a sufficient quantity of the finest quality of 
 salt is added and thoroughly wroked in. It is then 
 printed as per sample. Respectfully Yours, 

JoxA. F. Garrard. 

N. B. — We use a churn of ray own getting up. It 
 IS called "Garrard's Revolving Barrel Churn." We 
 have churned in it forty pounds of butter from four- 
 teen gallons of cream at one time, in thirty minutes. 

Coates' Method of Making Cheese. — The nights 
 milk which is intended to be warmed, is strained in- 
 to a large copper boiler, and put into one of Molls' 
 Orange county furnaces, and water is put into the 
 kettle. The fire, consequently, does not come near 
 the milk, to scorch or affect it in the least. The remain- 
 der oi the milk is strained into a tub or vat, where 
 the morning's milk is also put, and the heated milk 
 is also poured into the tub, so as to have it as near 
 the temperature that milk is, when drawn from the 
 cow, as possible. The rennet is then put into it. The 
 amount depends entirely upon its strength. It is 
 then all thoroughly stirred tog'Hher, and allowed to 
 stand for half an hour, when the curd is cut up with 
 a curd cutter, and in half an hour is ready to have the 
 whey dipped in the boiler, for the purpose of scald- 
 ing the curd. It must not be hurried too much in 
 this process, else you will diminish the amount of 
 curd. The hot wh'>y is then poured on to the curd 
 and allowed to remain until it will squeak when 
 slightly compressed by the hand. After this is dip- 
 ped off, a pail of pure cold water is poured upon it, 
 and remains until the whole is cooled. It is then put 
 into a sink and salted; a teacup being allowed for 
 15 ounces of curd. It is then put into the press, and 
 in half an hour is turned, and then remains for 24 
 hours, when it is taken out, and a bandage is then 
 nut on, and it is pressed in a heavy press for 24 hours, 
 and is then taken to the choose house, and is greased 
 and turned daily. C. Q. Curtis,

Process of Manufacturing Cheese as Furnished 

BY Job Hayes, of Chester Co., Pa. — The milk, im- 
 mediately after being drawn from the cow, is strain- 
 ed into large tubs, and a sufficient quantity of rennet 
 added to curdle the milk. When curdled, it is bro- 
 ken up fine with the hand, and then let stand for 
 about half an hour, when the whey is drained off. It 
 is then broken up with the hand, and a sufficient 
 quantity of salt added to make it palatable, when it is 
 placed in vats and subjected to pressure in proportion 
 trt the size of the cheese, for 48 hours, being turned 
 four times while pressing. Next, they arc placed 
 upon shelves in a dry and airy room, and turned and 
 greased daily. 

The object throughout, with the manufacturer, is 
 to imitate nature. 

Report of the Committee on Domestic Wines, Boun- 
 ces, and Cordials, at the late State Fair. 

The Committee on Domestic Wines, &c., respect- 
 fully report, that they carefully examined and tested 
 samples of the different Wines, Cordials, and Ciders 
 exhibited at the Fair. 

The Crabb Apple Cider of Mr. II. G. Ilerr, of Lan- 
 caster county, is sweet and pleasant to the taste, and 
 so highly charged with gas, as to merit the appella- 
 tion of "sparkling." It retains, in a great degree, 
 the flavor of the fruit, but as Mr. Ilerr declined to 
 communicate his recipe, the Committee do not feel war- 
 ranted in recommending it as a beverage, nor can 
 they, in the absence of all information from him, un- 
 dertake to say whether or not it would be economi- 
 cal and advisable to prepare it for general use. 

Mr. Joseph Konigmacher, of Lancaster county, ex- 
 hibited Mountain Crab Apple Cider, which the Com- 
 mittee recommend as a mild and pleasant drink. 

The Cider of Mrs. Horst, of Lancaster county, is 
 clear and strong, and although eight years old, is &d 
 sound and sweet, apparently, as when first made. 

The Currant Wine of Jacob B. Tschnety, of Litiz, 
 Lancaster county, possesses much of the flavor and 
 odor of the fruit. 

The Wines manufactured from Catawba and Isa- 
 bella grape, by John M. Summy, of Lancaster coun- 
 ty, are rich, fine, and luscious. They can fairly be 
 classed among the good kinds of sweet wine. 

Mr. Jacob B. Shuman, of Lancaster county, ex- 
 hibited some Cherry Bounce, and a variety of domes- 
 tic Wines. His Blackberry, Elderberry, and Cur- 
 rant Wines, are excellent domestic Wines. 

Mrs. Wealthy Ilale, of Bradford county, exhibited 
 some Currant Wine, t ree years old, which, although 
 free from all alcohol, except that formed by the fer- 
 mentation of the wine itself, is sweet, smooth and 
 fragrant. Mrs. Ilale puts in a ten gallon keg ten 
 quarts of currant juice, and thirty-three pounds of 
 maple sugar, and then fills the keg with warm water. 
 In a few days it begins to ferment. After it has 
 worked itself clear, she lets it stand in a cool place, 
 three or six months, when she botles and seals it 
 well. A few good raisins may be added to each 
 bottle. 

Mr. N. Longworth, of Cincinnati, Oliio, exhib- 
 ited some sparkling Catawba, and sparkling Isabel- 
 la Wines, both possessing a fine bouquet, and fairly 
 comparable with many of the brands of Champagne. 
 As a rich and fragrant domestic Wine, the Commit- 
 tee consider it entitled to rank in the first class. The 
 Committee award a premium of $3 to Mr. Long- 
 worth, for the best domestic Wine. 

They award a premium of $3 to Mr. Jacob B. Shu- 
 man,ot Lancaster county, for the best Cherry Bounce,
