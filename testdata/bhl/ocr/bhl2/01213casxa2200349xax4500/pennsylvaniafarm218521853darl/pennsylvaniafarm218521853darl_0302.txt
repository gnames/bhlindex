IMPORTANT TO FARMERS I 

THE farmers who make the most money are those who take 
 advantage of all improvements in agricultural implements or 
 stock, so as to receive in return for their labor as large a 
 yield as possible. The truth of this assertion will be admitted by 
 every one. The only question then, the farmer has to decide when 
 about to purchase a new implement is, which is the best T To 
 those in want of a Wind Mill or Grain Fan, 

Baniborougn's Improved Fauniiijj Mill 
 is eonfidentlyoflered as the very ts.vt article of the kindthat can be had 
 itsadvantagea over all other Fans can be told in a few words, viz ; 
 it will do more and belttr work inle.^s time and with less labor than any 
 other description of fan ever offered to the public, /n proof of this 
 statement, l refer to the eight thousand farmers in the United 
 States who have used my fans, and to the proceedings of the vari- 
 ous State and county AgricullUiul Societies held within the last 
 six years, at which my Fan was, in all ca.tes, awarded the highest 
 premiums over numerous competitors ! A large number of silver 
 medals and diplomas can be seen by calling at my shop

 ed : 

Lexington, Missowi, Nov. 24, 1851. 

Mr. Bamborongh— Dear sir : 1 see by the reports of the diffe- 
 rent Agricultuial exhibitions that you have been getting more pre- 
 miums and honors for your celebrated patent grain fan. And why 
 should you not ? You surely are justly entitled to any that were 
 awarded you. In my opinion, the equal to your fan is no where 
 to be found, much less its superior. The millers say to all the 
 farmers who bring in their wheat 'that it is not very clean ; that 
 they ought to get a mill like / got of you to clean their wheat, for 
 we have no use for rolling screens or smut mnchines,for any grain 
 cleaned on the mills /got of you. JOHN T. NICHOLAS. 

P. S— / am now making out a bill to send to you for a large 
 number of your fans, as soon as the navigation opens. J. T. N.

TO FARMERS— SALINE FERTILIZER. 

This preparation is designed to furnish the soil the various min- 
 cal or inorganic miiterials abstracted from it by plants in the pru- 
 eress of vegetation. 

It contains a large proportion of the salts of potash soda and 
 ammonia, combined with Bi-I'hosphate of Lime, Animal Charcoa) 
 and other fertilizing matter ; the whole forming a highly concen- 
 trated manure. 

In thus offering a new article to the attention of farii.eis, the re- 
 lative value of which remains to be tested by experience, it is de- 
 sired not to venture upon any assertions respecting it, calculatei 
 to excite expectations, which, perhaps, might not be realized ; 
 knowing, however, that the principal constituents of this com- 
 pound have been proved to be highly valuable separately, it it 
 confidently believed that tbeir combination in proper proportions in 
 the ''Saline Fertilizer" will foimau excellent manure. 
 DIRECTIONS FOR USE. 

The Fertilizer should be applied at the rate of two barrels to the 
 acre, and spread broadcast on the surface 

If, on opening the barrels, the salts should be found adhering- to- 
 gether in lumps, they should be broken, say with the back of a 
 shovel, upon a floor or smooth surfaee, and, if convenieiit,a little 
 geod dry mould may l.e added, and well mixed before spreading 

For wheat or rye one barrel per acre may be used before sow- 
 ing, and lightly harrowed in, and the other applied as a top dresa- 
 iiig early in the spring, at the commencement of the first thaw. 

Upon grass it should be sown broad-cast, and. if possible, when 
 the ground is wet, or when there is a probability of rain, to dis- 
 solve the ferlilizing salts : generally late in the fall or early in the 
 spring, will be found to answer best. 

Upon corn, it would perhaps be advisable to apply one barrel in- 
 the hill and one broad-cast. 

If added to the manure or compost pile, the Fertilizer will doubt* 
 less incresse greatly the efficacy of the mixture. 

The experience of Agricu turists will probably auggcst other 
 modes of employing it. as soon as they become satisfied of its utili- 
 ty. It should not, however, in any case be mixed with quick-lime 
 which will cause a loss of ammonia, nor should it be buried deeper 
 iu the soil.
