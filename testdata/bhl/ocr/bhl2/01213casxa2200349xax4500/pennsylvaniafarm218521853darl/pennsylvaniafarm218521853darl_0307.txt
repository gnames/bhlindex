be taken by our State Society at its approaching 
 meeting. Something of the kind seems required 
 grapes to New York, and which bring from $6 to $9 
 per 100 lbs. He thinks there is room for 20 vine- 
 yards in the same locality as his own. The yearly 
 consumption of grapes in Paris is said to be ten mil- 
 lions of pounds. C. A. Cable, of Cleveland, has an 
 orchard of 100 cherry trees, which has yielded in one 
 year, over $1000. A farmer near Darby, Pa., has 20 
 apple trees of two varieties, occupying half an acre, 
 which have produced 300 bushels, and yielded a pro- 
 fit 1225. R. J. Hand, of Monroe county. New York, 
 has sold $440 of Northern Spy, and Roxbury Rus- 
 set, from a single acre. A single orchard in Rocking- 
 ham county, New Hampshire, of two acres, produces 
 anunally, 800 bushels of first-rate winter apples. In 
 Orange county, N. Y., over $300 worth of plums have 
 been sold from one-quarter of an acre. The Rey- 
 bolds, of Delaware, have nearly 1000 acres in peach 
 trees, and have sent 5000 baskets in a single day lo 
 market, and have realized in one year, $20 to $30,000 
 clear of expenses. An acre of ground in strawber- 
 ries, with proper culture, can be made to yield 100 
 bushels. A friend of ours in New Jersey, has mar. 
 keted in Philadeldhia the present season, over 200 
 bushels, at 12 J to 25 cts. per quart. The Patent Of- 
 fice report states that in 1848, in 17 days, 4,572 bush- 
 els of strawberries were sold in New York, 514 bush, 
 els in a single day. Over 80,000 baskets, equal to 
 833 bushels, and weighing probably 25 tons, were 
 brought to the city in one day by the Erie Railroad. 
 Of raspberries, Charles Downing, nurseryman, near 
 Newburg, N. Y., states that one of his neighbors 
 sold $300 worth from one-third of an acre, one sea- 
 son, and from 3 acres realized a net profit of $1,500. 
 They were of the true Red Antwerp. The culture of 
 Gooseberries is also very profitable, and we have 
 heard, the present season, of nearly $300 worth being 
 sold from little over half an acre. As regards pear 
 culture, the field is almost wholly unoccupied, and 
 since the introduction of the Pear on Quince; obviat- 
 ing to a great extent the liability to blight, occupying 
 but little ground, and making quick returns, we be- 
 lieve it to be as much, if not more profitable than the 
 others. One of our friends in N. Jersey informs us he 
 planted out '6 years ago, 300 dwarf pear trees, which 
 averaged him this season one peck each, and at ten 
 feet apart, they occupy less than one acre of ground. 
 We do not know w:iat the wholesale price was, but 
 we know they were retailed at second hand from 12J 
 to 25 cts. each; less than half of this would realize 
 $600 to the acre, and of course the product will an- 
 nually increase. Many persons are deterred from 
 the Fruit business, by the length of time before the 
 trees come into profit. This depends entirely on the 
 attention they receive. Apple trees may be ten or 
 twelve years before fruiting, or they may be made to 
 produce a bushel each in five years from the plant- 
 ing. Dwaif pears often bear the first year they are 

put out, thus making almost immediate returns. We 
 have known of a dwarf pear tree in Philadelphia 
 the present season to have produced five to six bush- 
 els. The cultivation of the ground between the 
 trees where orchards are planted, and the planting 
 of the smaller fruits, root crops, &c., will often 
 not only repay all expenses, interest on land, &c., 
 till the larger trees come into bearing, such as Ap- 
 ples, Pears, Plums and Cherries, but will in many 
 localities, cover the cost of the land also. A full 
 grown apple tree will yield from ten to forty bushels. 
 Four hundred bushels may be considered a reason- 
 able estimate for an acre. We close this article, 
 which is much longer than we intended, by advising 
 all disposed to go into the fruit business, to procure 
 one of Downing's, Thomas', or Barry's Fruit Books, 
 for directions as to selection of varieties, planting, 
 pruning and general management. 

Agricultural College and a Model Farm. 

We learn from the American Farmer, that the re- 
 quisite funds, $50,000, have been raised to establish 
 an Agricultural Department in connection with Del- 
 aware College, Delaware, and that efforts are now 
 making "to secure the services of one of the best 
 Agricultural Chemists in the country," as one of 
 the Professors. It is also contemplated to establish 
 in connection with the same, a model and experi- 
 mental farm. 

The State Agricultural Society of Maryland at ita 
 la'e fair, have also advocated "that a memorial be 
 addressed to their Legislature for the endowment of 
 a Professorship of Agricultural Chemistry, to be 
 connected with St. John's College, Annapolis." â€” 
 The public spirited men of these two states, without 
 reference to party politics, appear to be unanimous 
 and earnest on this subject. It seems already secur- 
 ed in Delaware, and there is every probability that 
 Maryland and other states will soon follow. Is Penn- 
 sylvania going to be behindhand? Are our farmers 
 so far ahead of those north and south of them, that 
 no instruction is needed? Is the theory and practice 
 of agriculture in Pennsylvania already perfect, and 
 are the great fundamental principles, which lie at 
 the root of all good farming, everywhere and in all 
 countries, better understood here than in our sister 
 states? Does our land produce its greatest capabili- 
 ty, with the least labor, expense and impoverishment? 
 Are our agricultural machinery and implements 
 more perfect than elsewhere? Is our live stock- 
 throughout the state, cattle, horses, sheep and swine, 
 poultry, of the best and most improved breeds? Un- 
 less these questions can all be answered affirmative- 
 ly, we also need a model and experimental fj\rm, 
 and an Agricultural Professorship; and it is to be 
 hoped that some decided action on the subject may
