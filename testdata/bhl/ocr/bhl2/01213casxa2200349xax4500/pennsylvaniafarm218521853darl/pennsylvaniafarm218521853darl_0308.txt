EDITORIAF^STATISTICS OF STOCK. 

January, 

by the times, and the example around us. It would 
 result in a vast amount of good, to the substantial 
 interests of the state, augmenting aggregate and in- 
 dividual wealth, and we cannot think the necessary 
 legislation would be refused, if the subject were well 
 understood, and a suitable report prepared in the 
 Legislature. As itwould be for the purpose of putting 
 money into the pockets of the people, not to take it 
 out, the action ot their representative.- would be sus- 
 tained without doubt at home. Attached to a model 
 and experimental farm of the kind we allude to, 
 there should be an Agricultural Chemist, competent 
 to analyze soils, for the benefit of the farmers of the 
 whole state, who might also at certain seasons, visit 
 the different county associations, and deliver lectures 
 on scientific and practical Agriculture, on Geology, 
 Mineralogy and Botany, so far as they are connected 
 ■with the same, and who should be required to col- 
 lect agricultural statistics and make annual reports, 
 as to the modes of culture pursued in various sections. 
 The model farm should be the repository for the re- 
 ception and cultivation of new and foreign plants, 
 seeds, vegetables, &c. New implements should be 
 tested there and reported upon. Experiments in the 
 culture of various crops should be accurately made, 
 and their adaptation to our soil, climate and relative 
 profit for particular localities, made public for the 
 general benefit. Careful experiments should be made 
 with the various improved breeds of animals, the 
 best and most profitable reared, and placed within 
 the reach of purchasers, who could visit the farm, 
 and obtain reliable information as to their respective 
 merits. This ■« ould be a very valuable feature of it. 
 The model farm should also contain an arboretum 
 of our own and foreign plants, trees and shrubs, open 
 at all times to the public, and scientifically arranged, 
 and also should have an experimental ground for 
 testing the different kinds of fruit, and their adapta- 
 tion to our soil and climate. The experimental gar- 
 den of the Horticultural Society of London, contains 
 900 varieties of fruits, and upwards of 1500 have 
 been tested there. 

Without consultation with any one, it strikes us, 
 these are some of the benefits to be attained by leg- 
 islative action on the subject of agriculture and the 
 establishment of a model farm, and we much hope 
 the present session of our legislature will not close, 
 without the initiatory steps being taken to bring it 
 about. 

Statistics of Stoch: iu the United States. 

The following is from the Journal of the United 
 States Agricultural Society, and it contains much of 

interest. 

Poultry and Eggs.— Fowls like the warm south- 
 ern aspect, where they can huddle together in the 
 sun during the middle of the day. Provide them 
 such a place, and plenty of food, such as corn, bar- 
 ley, wheat, cobmeal, mixed with scalding water or 
 hot potatoes, with occasional feeds of the flesh of 
 young calves, plucks of sheep, and constant access 
 to pure water, gravel, old mortar, oyster or clam shells 
 and bones, all broken finely, and they will yield eggs 
 in abundance through the cold weather .-iV. U. Farm r. 

Horses.— If it should be necessary to place every 
 farmer in the Union on horseback, there are 4,325,- 
 G52 horses in the country, for their service. Ohio 
 has the honor of rearing and keeping more horses 
 than any other state : the whole number reported be- 
 ing 463,398. New York had 447,014, Pennsylvania 
 330,398, and Kentucky 315,581. 

The improvement of four and a half million horses, 
 worth at least ^200,000,000, is an object worthy of 
 more attention than it has hitherto received. State 
 and County Agricultural Societies have done some- 
 thing, and the high price of good animals more, to en- 
 courage the breeding and rearing of superior road- 
 sters, and good horses of all work. But the years of 
 service rendered by a majority of them are fewer than 
 they ought to be in this country. To prolong their 
 lives, and increase their value, their natural wants, 
 constitution and diseases must be more studied, and 
 better understood by those that own and use them. 
 We ought to excel all other nations in the number 
 of fine horses, for we possess unequaled advantages 
 for producing them to any desirable extent. 

Asses and Mules. — Of these useful animals the 
 census gives only 529,070 in all the States and Terri- 
 tories. New Mexico had 8,654, and only 5,079 horses; 
 Tennessee is the largest producer of mules, reporting 
 75,903 ; Kentucky had 65,609 ; Alabama 58,895, and 
 Georgia 57.379. 

The gro'W'ing of mules is profitable, and the busi- 
 ness has been considerably extended within the last 
 two year?. 

MiLcn Cows. — The number of cows exceeds the 
 estimate that we have had occasion to make of this 
 kind of farm stock, in all the states except New 
 York, where the returns are below what we expect- 
 ed from the number given by the State census of 1845. 
 The whole number of cows in the United Stotes two 
 years ago, was 6,991,946, Of these New York had 
 931,324 ; Ohio, 544,499 ; Pennsylvania, 530.224, and 
 Georgia, 334,223. 

Cows differ more in value for milking purposes than 
 is generally supposed. Thousands fail to pay their 
 way, and are a positive tax on their owners ; while 
 a first rate milker yields a large profit on the food 
 consumed. How to banish all indifferent and worth- 
 less kinds, and fill theirplaces with superior animals, 
 is a question for the intelligent growers of neat stock 
 to consider. Deterioration is practiced bya hundred 
 farmers where improvement is duly studied by one. 
 As a general thing, cows and their offspring must be 
 better kept before any decided change for the better 
 is attainable. High quality in ancestral blood avails 
 nothing in the veins of a starved calf. Without good 
 keeping the breeds of stocks are ntterly worthless. 

Working Oxen and other Cattle. — We are not 
 informed to what age young steers must attain be- 
 fore they are entitled to rank as "working oxen ;" or 
 whether, in case they have never been subjected to 
 the yoke, they are excluded, no matter what their 
 years, from the catalogue of "working cattle." We 
 suspect that entire uniformity in reporting "working 
 oxen" and "other cattle," has not been observed in 
 all the states. Be that as it may, the latter number 
 10 265,180 ; while the former are set down at 1,698,- 
 261. By adding together the milch cows, working 
 oxen and other cattle, it will be seen that the aggre- 
 gate of neat stock was 18,355,387 head. New York
