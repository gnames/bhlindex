STRAWBERRIES— TABLE— SHEEP. 

Januart, 

know that my crop was more superior the past sea- 
 son than formerly; from a piece of ground measur- 
 idg GO feet by loo, we ])icked, on May 26th, about 
 25 quarts; on the 28th, 150 quarts; May 31st, 400 
 quarts; June 2d, 250 quarts; June 4th, about 200; 
 June 6th, about the same quantity ; at this time M^e 
 suffered with drought which I should think cut the 
 crop one-fourth short to what might have been expec- 
 ted. From beginning to end we picked fruit from 
 the same ground for three weeks; from 30 to 40 qts. 
 was the hist picking. 7th. IIow it stands the climate ? 
 I have never seen Alice injured in the least by winter 
 frosts, and I know of no strawberry' that stands the 
 heat and drought as well. 8th. Mode of cultivation ? 
 When convenient, prefer spring planting. I plant 
 my plants from 8 to 12 inches in the rows, and 24 in- 
 ches between the rows. I often plant between crops 
 of early cabbage. I hoe through them the following 
 summer, keep them clear of weeds, and crop off the 
 runners as fast as they make; the following spring I 
 throw in some kind of trash to keep fhe fruit from 
 the ground. Tanners' bark is the most convenient 
 thing that I can procure; it appears to answer the 
 purpose very well.

The importance of improving our flocks, ought to 
 attract the attention of every man in America who 
 understands the meaning of the word improvement. 
 Those who do not understand its meaning, will still 
 continue to sh.ar those little scrubby animals called 
 sheep, with bare bellys and hairy backs, getting 
 fleeces weighing at most, not over two and a-half lbs. 
 on an average, and of a quality almost as worthless 
 as that which a certain notorious character ol)tained 
 at the shearing which gave a great cry but little wool. 
 To those who delight in reading what improvement 
 has done, we commend the f dlowing letter: 

"Believing the subject of wool growing worthy of 

some attention, I take the liberty to send you a wood 
 cut engraved from a daguerrotype view of a group of 
 French Merino Sheep, lately imported by William 
 Chamberlain of your city, and myself. 

The buck Matchless represented, is three years old, 
 and weighed on the first of March last, 261 pounds. 
 His fleece, sheared last June, of one year's growth, 
 (after suffering the usual loss on the sea voyage,) was 
 twenty pounds twelve ounces. This buck I consider 
 equal to any that I saw while in France ; and as to 
 thickness and fineness of fleece, shape and constitu- 
 tion, he is acknowledged, by all who have examined 
 him, to be equal to any of the breed.
