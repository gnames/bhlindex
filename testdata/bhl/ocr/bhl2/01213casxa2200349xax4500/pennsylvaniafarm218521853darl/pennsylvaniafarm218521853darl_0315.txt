ABORTION IN COWS.

and the due presorvation of thia depends partly on 
 a quiescent state of the rest of the system ; hence 
 the cow, during pregnancy, is more th in usually 
 docile. Sume persons are of opinion that the imag- 
 ination of a pregnant animal is easily acted on by 
 impressions which, at other times, would scarcely 
 produce any effect, and many cases can be adduced 
 which show that sudden fright and intense mental 
 emotion have been followed by abortion. 

When a pregnant cow, then, is so situated that she 
 can smell the odor arising from another cow which 
 has aborted, we may reasonably expect that the sen- 
 sation so produced will, irom what has been stated, 
 be attended with peculiar consequences. The circle 
 of nervous influence, which establishes a connection 
 between the organs of smell, the brain, and the ute- 
 rus, -will be influenced thereby, and the nterus, from 
 the predisposing nature of its condition and functions, 
 especially responds to this peculiar stimulus. Irri- 
 tation applied to nerves, induces action in organs to 
 which such nerves pass, and, in the present instance, 
 action, as a result of nervous excitement, is induced 
 in the uterus, which organ continues from time to 
 time to act upon its contents till they are expelled. 
 Thus we conceive it is that odors arising from cows 
 casting calf induce abortion in others of their preg- 
 nant companions, and by adopting this explanation 
 we can account for the apparently contagious nature 
 of abortion, without admitting that it is cnntagious 
 in reality. Other odors of an offensive kind are be- 
 lieved by some (and we think, with good reason,) to 
 cause abortion. Cattle will often collect in numbers 
 around places containing decomposing animal and 
 vegetable matter, and by bellowing and tearing the 
 earth with their feet and horns, will betray a high 
 degree of excitement ; this, especially to pregnant 
 animals, cannot fail to be injurious. 

Over-feeding seems sometimes to cause abortion, 
 by promoting such a state of system in a cow as is 
 unfavorable to the healthy development of the foetus. 
 It is not animals in a plethoric habit of body that 
 are best adapted for breeding ; indeed, it is a common 
 remark that fat cows have generally smaller calves 
 than those not in such high condition. Large quan- 
 tities of rich and stimulating food may favor the de- 
 position of fat in a pregnant cow, but her circulating 
 blood by being highly charged with nutritious mate- 
 rial, becomes less adapted for the requirements of 
 foetal subsistence. In some parts of the country, 
 where cattle are fed on low, marshy ground, or on 
 land yielding rank and succulent herbage, such as 
 grows on meadows occasionally flooded, abortion will 
 occur to a great extent. It seems hereto be induced 
 by the irritating or stimulating action which the her- 
 bage of these localities exercises on the bowels, which 
 action, being of prolonged duration, ultimately influ- 
 ences the uterus. There is great sympathy, (so call- 
 ed) between the uterus and digestive organs; they 
 lie in close connection with each other, are formed 
 of the same kind of muscle and membranes, and are 
 supplied with blood-vessels and nerves from the same 
 common centres. Among organs in the animal frame 
 so related, there is always a strong disposition to be- 
 come affected, each in its own way, by much the same 
 common causes of disease, provided those causes act 
 with sufficient intensity. An opinion obtains in some 
 localities, that abortion is produced by cattle drink- 
 ing the water of particular streams and springs 
 which contain an undue amount of mineral materi- 
 als. Some waters are known not to agree with ani- 
 mals, more especially with man and the horse, and 
 it is quite possiljle they may exercise an injurious ef- 
 fect on cows also, but whether any waters which cat- 

tle will usually drink are really capable of producing 
 abortion, observation and fair experiment have not 
 yet, in our opinion, sufficed to prove. It is very rare 
 indeed, that cattle, if left to themselves, will eat any 
 kind of plants which produce injurious effects on the 
 system ; their exquisite sense of smell and instinc- 
 tive knowledge cause them to avoid deleterious vege- 
 tables as food. We know of no cases in which abor- 
 tion was fairly traceable to the action of the acrid or 
 poisonous plants. 

Treatment of Auoktiox — This is to be consider- 
 ed under two heads; first, iha preventive, and, second, 
 the remedial treatment: the former is to be enforced 
 when certain symptoms present themselves, which, 
 as has been before shown, threaten abortion, and is 
 also to be applied to prevent extension of abortion 
 among healthy animals. The remedial treatment is 
 to be employed in cases of actual abortion. 

1. Preventive Treatment. — If there are grounds for 
 believing that abortion is caused by mechanical inju- 
 ry, the owner of cattle must exercise strict vigilance 
 over those to whom he intrusts the management of 
 his stock. He must provide against them being apt 
 to suffer from leaping, as they are liable>) do when 
 mischief or other inducements tempt them to break 
 their fences. It a pregnant cow has "hoove," the 
 veterinary surgeon or person in attendance must 
 adopt the most summary way of liberating or neu- 
 tralizing the gas. Every cow should be separated 
 from he'r companions immediately after she has cast 
 calf, and placed in such a situation that all commu- 
 nication with them by means of smell or otherwise, 
 may be prevented. She must be well supplied with 
 bedding, which is to be kept clean by frequent chang- 
 ing. Care must be taken that the discharges do not 
 coUect about her, and if the placenta is retained, 
 means must be used to neutralizethe odor arising 
 in consequence of its decomposition. The ani- 
 mal must be kept in a cool, pure atmosphere, and 
 supplied with food and water in moderate quantity. 
 It will be observed that many of the above precau- 
 tions, which are here advised as moans ol prevent- 
 ing extension of smell subsequent to abortion, are 
 also highly useful as means of remedial treatment. 

Strict attention must be paid to the cows among 
 which the aSected animal was kept, in order that the 
 premonitory symptoms of abortion m-y at once be 
 noticed if they occur. The peculiar colored dis- 
 charge, which has been before alluded to, is always 
 to be taken as an indication of danger, and if, in ad- 
 dition to its appearance, there is a visible sudden 
 increase in size of the outer organs of generation and 
 udder, beyond what the period of gestation would 
 warrant, we would have little reason to doubt that 
 abortion will take place if means of prevention are 
 not employed. The animal must be copiously bled, 
 placed in a situation where she can be kept perfectly 
 quiet, her diet must be moderate and of such a qual- 
 ity as will favor an open condition of the bowels. 
 No purgative medicine must be given; — the irritation 
 which this creates would increase the abortive ten- 
 dency. Our object here is to tranquilize the system 
 and the uterine excitement, and to attain this end 
 we may advantageously administer sedative medi- 
 cine. None is better than such a formula as the fol- 
 lowing: '2 07,. of tincture of opium, and 2 oz. of ni- 
 trous aether, mixed in an imperial qi>art of gruel, 
 and given daily, or so long as circumstances seem to 
 require it. Cold water may be copiously applied to 
 the external parts of generation several times daily. 
 We often find that if the, above simple means are 
 timely and energetically employed, the symptoms of 
 abortion entirely disappear.
