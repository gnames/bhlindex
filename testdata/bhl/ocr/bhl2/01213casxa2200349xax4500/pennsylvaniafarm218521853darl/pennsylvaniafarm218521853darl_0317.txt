ABORTION IN COWS.

unhealthy inflammatory condition of the lining mem- of lime, and inject a diluted form of the same into 
 brane of these organs, and, from the irritation thus } the vagina ; this, with a plentiful supply of clean 
 established, it is not unusual for the cow to become fe- 1 litter, will in some measure, overcome the effluvia al- 

verish, refuse her food, and rapidly fall off in condi- 
 tion. 

The foetus is to be securely buried as soon after 
 abortion as possible. All persons agree in the pro- 
 priety of adopting such a practice, but a sinjrular 
 difference of opinion exists with regard to the propri- 
 ety of removing the cleansing, or of suffering it to 
 remain. Those who advocate letting it remain, ad- 
 vise that the passages containing it sliould be kept as 
 clean as possible, and that antiseptic preparations 
 should be used to destroy the offensive odor which it 

ways present in these cases. Some formers smear 
 the walls and wood work of their cowhouses with tar 
 and melted pitch, to counteract, or, as they think, to 
 prevent the smell alluded to ; there is no harm in 
 adopting such a practice, but there is little amount 
 of good derived from it in comparison with that at- 
 tendant upon taking the cleansing away, rigidly sep- 
 arating the affected animals from others, and other- 
 wise treating them as here advised. 

"Cleansing drinks," so called, are extensively pre- 
 scribed by farriers and druggists in various parts of 

generates. They seem to imagine that danger which ! the country, under the idea that such compounds in 

they cannot describe is likely to arise if mechanical 
 means are employed to remove it. A person, how- 
 ever, who understands the anatomy and functions of 
 the organs concerned, is fully aware that such an idea 
 is fallacious, and knows that, unless under some pe- 
 culiar circumstances, he can take the cleansing away 
 with perfect safety. It is suraly better to do this 
 than subject the cow to the well-known inconvenien- 
 ces of its retention. In order to satisfy himself of 
 she propriety of removing it, the operator, after hav- 
 ing the cow securely held, washes out the vagina with 
 warm water ; he then introduces his hand, well oiled, 
 to feel if the os uteri is sufficiently open to allow it 
 to pass into the uterus ; if so, there is not the slight- 
 est danger in attempting to take the cleansing away. 
 Should any part of the membranes be hanging from 
 the vulva, they must be taken hold of by the other 
 hand, twisted several times round, (so as to render 
 them less liable to break,) and pulled at gently. By 
 thus stretching them the operator is better enabled to 
 feel with his hand in the uterus where the attach- 
 ments between it and the cleansing are situated. He 
 gradually passes his hand round the interior of the 
 uterus and loosens the points of connection, com- 
 mencing at the entrance and proceeding to the horns 
 of the womb, to one of which the cleansing is main- 
 ly attached. He may require to exercise some degree 
 of pulling or separating force with the hand thus em- 
 ployed, and should be careful not t ) tear the cleans- 
 ing more than he can possibly avoid ; it is always bet- 
 ter to remove it at once (if possible) than piecemeal. 
 When the hand can be passed into the uterus, and 
 if decay of the cleansing be not too far advanced, 
 there are very lew cases in which we cannot remove 
 it by exercising due precaution. After extraction 
 has been accomplished, the uterus should be gently 
 but well syringed with tepid water, among which a 
 small quantity of chloride of lime may be dissolved. 
 A competent operator incurs no risk of injuring the 
 uterus, for all the necessary force of manipulation is 
 applied to the attached points of the cleansing. 

Some persons who have objections to the above 
 mode of j roceeding, in consequence of the extremely 
 offensive stench, the disgusting nature of the dis- 
 charge, or from an erroneous idea of injurious conse- 
 quences which they suppose likely to ensue, attach 
 weights to the cleansing, in order, as they imagine, 
 to drag it away. The force thus applied mostly caus- 
 es the membranes to break inside the vagina, and not 
 being determined to the real points of attachment, 
 is seldom of much benefit ; moderate pulling force, 
 occasionally applied by the hand, in a horizontal di- 
 rection is much preferable, although but rarely ef- 
 fective in bringing the cleansing away. If the pred- 
 judice of the owner bo such as not to allow of any 
 mechanical interference for its removal, and if he be 
 not incorrigibly careless and ignorant, ho may wash 
 the cleansing repeatedly with a solution of chloride 

some way or other promote expulsion of the cleans 
 ing. These drinks are, for the most part, composed 
 of stimulating aromatic ingredients, combined with 
 purgative and diuretic medicines. They are seldom 
 productice of any good effects beyond those which 
 depend on their purgative action, whilst their aro- 
 matic and resinous properties very frequently render 
 them highly injurious, by acting directly on a class 
 of organs previously irritated, and probably in a 
 state of inflamation. A dose of saline purgative 
 medicine, such as half a pound to a pound of Epsom 
 salts, with an ounce of ginger, and half a pound of 
 treacle, mixed in a quart or three pints of meal gru- 
 el, is frequently of service, and forms about the on- 
 Iv "cleansing drink" which the non-professional man 
 should trust himself to administer. It the animal bo 
 really weak and in low condition, half a pint to a pint 
 of good ale may be combined ^vith the drench here 
 recommended. If the bowels are already sufficiently 
 open to forbid the use of laxative medicine, ale with 
 treacle-gruel may be given instead. Ergot of rye 
 is- much relied on by some, as causing expulsion of 
 the cleansing. We have not found it to be a medi- 
 cine to be much depended on in this respect. It has 
 been given in two-drachm and half-ounce doses to 
 pregnant rabbits and bitches daily, for weeks togeth- 
 er without producing any perceptible uterine action.

If the placenta is retained, and the hand of the op- 
 erator cannot be introduced into the uterus, in con- 
 sequence of contraction of the os uteri, and if no part 
 of the cleansing can be taken hold of, the calf-bed 
 must be syringed with warm water, by means of a 
 suitable instrument, which the veterinary surgeon, 

for the most part, is alone competent to use. It ia 
 improper to attempt removal of the cleansing, as be- 
 fore advised, if the hand cannot be introduced into 
 the uterus by applying a moderate degree of dilating 
 pressure, or if the cleansing is so firmly attached as 
 not to give way to the application of reasonable 
 force. 

After some cases of abortion, as well as after some 
 of ordinary parturition, the cow is affected with se- 
 vere straining, or bearing down, called after-pains. 
 These will, in cases of abortion, sometimes continue 
 for several days, and induce a highly feverish state 
 of system in the suffering animal. They are occa- 
 sionally accompanied by a discharge of blood, and 
 are mostly observed when the cleansing is entirely 
 retained in the uterus, and apparently depend on the 
 already irritable calf-bed suffering under additional 
 excitement induced by the dead weight and peculiar 
 position of the cleansing, now to be regarded as a for- 
 eign body, and which it is desirable to expel. After 
 ordinary parturition, these straining efforts are some- 
 times so energetic, as to cause "throwing down" of 
 the uterus. Although this accident seldom occurs
