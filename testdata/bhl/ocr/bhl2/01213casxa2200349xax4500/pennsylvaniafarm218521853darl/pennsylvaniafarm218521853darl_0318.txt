ABORTION IN COWS. 

January, 

after abortion, in consequence of the small size of 
 the OS uteri and outer passages, yet, for the relief of 
 the animal, it is desirable that, if possible, these pains 
 should be overcome. Two or three ounces of tincture 
 of opium and two ounces of nitrous aether may occa- 
 sionally be given in a quart of warm gruel. The 
 hand should be introduced to ascertain if th) oleans- 
 in<>- be loosened, and, as is sometimes the case, entan- 
 eled upon itself near the neck of the uterus; if itcan 
 be removed, or even drawn towards the vagina, strain- 
 ing mostly ceases. 

A cow, after abortion, should be fed on good food, 
 but of such a quality as will induce a lax condition 
 of the bowels ; boiled barley or linseed, cooked roots, 
 as turnips and carrots, form excellent diet. If, from 
 prolonged straining and other causes of irritation, she 
 is so feverish as not to feed at all, she must be offer- 
 ed plenty of drink, and if she will take flour or lin- 
 seed gruel, sweetened with treacle, we need be under 
 no great anxiety regarding her not feeding. Provi- 
 ded she will neither eat nor drink, we must (during 
 the time our best endeavors are directed to the remov- 
 al of the real cause of irritation and fever) support 
 her by administering gruel with a horn or bottle. 
 The stimulating drenches of the farrier and cowleech 
 must be strictly avoided; if any tonics or mild resto- 
 ratives be really needed, the using of them can only 
 safely be intrusted to the veterinary surgeon. 

When abortion is caused by mechanical injuries 
 Budienly inflicted, the uterus sometimes begirs to 
 contract, and forces the foetus into the os uteri and 
 vagina, before these organs have been sufficiently di- 
 lated to allow its free expulsion. The cow may even 
 continue straining for days, and all her eflforts only 
 seem to impact the fcetus still more firmly, and some 
 part of it, as the he id, neck, or feet and legs, will, 
 for this period, protrude from the vulva. In some 
 cases, her strenth becomes exhausted, and she may 
 die undelivered. This untoward event more partic- 
 ularly occurs to young animals, where the passages 
 to the uterus have not acquired that capacity which 
 they attain during the process of natural parturi- 
 tion. The assistance of an experienced practitioner 
 is required here, and, for the safety of the mother, he 
 frequently finds it needful to dissect a ay the foetus 
 piecemeal. In some cases, firm and judiciously ap- 
 plied pulling force will be sufficient to eflect its ab- 
 straction ; in others, an incision may be made with 
 a suitable knife along the lower part of the belly and 
 chest of the foetus, the viscera of these cavities re- 
 moved, then, by drawing it at its head and legs, the 
 sides of the bady are compressed, and delivery is ef- 
 fected. 

"Cross births," or "false presentations,'" seldom in- 
 terfere with delivery in abortion occurring at an ear- 
 ly period of gestation, but if it be del.ayed until with- 
 in six or nine weeks of the time of natural parturi- 
 tion, they sometimes prevent expulsions of the foetus. 
 False presentations with abortion aie often more dif- 
 ficult to rectify than when they occur at natural par- 
 turition, and in cases of this kind the aid of an ex- 
 perienced and dexterous practitioner is required, 
 whose best care is needed to ensure the cow's safety. 
 If she had been straining for some time, and the li- 
 quor amnii is partly evacuated without any appear- 
 ance of the foetus, the hand of the operator must be 
 introduced to ascertain its position. The presenta- 
 tion is almost always unnatural if the fcetus is not 
 expelled within a reasonable time after rupture of 
 the membranes, yet in some instances, although the 
 "water-bag has burst, the cow is cruelly allowed to 
 pass several days under labor-pains, without attempts 
 being made to relieve her. This is culpable neglect, 

for delay of this kind always increases the danger 
 and difficulty of delivery, and retards recovery. On 
 introducing the hand it is possible that the os uteri 
 may not be sufficiently open to allow the necessary 
 manipulation ; such being the case, steady attempts 
 may bo made to dilate it, and sufficient time allowed 
 for the purpose. If the pains are very severe, an 
 occasional dose of laudanum may be given to relieve 
 them ; chloroj'orm is highly efficacious in promoting 
 the same end. Some persons advocate bleeding, but 
 this is a remedy which, under all circumstances of 
 the case, we would rarely advise. Other practition- 
 ers recommend the application of extract of bella- 
 donna and other sedative substances to the os uteri; 
 their benefioial action, however, is very doubtful. We 
 believe that cautious, continued attempts at dilata- 
 tion, by expanding the hand in the contracted part, 
 affording due time for the efforts of nature herself, 
 and the administration of tinct. opii, as advised, 
 are the safest and most efficient means of pro- 
 moting an enlargement of the os uteri. When 
 the opening is sufficiently increased in size, the 
 presentation, if false, must be rectified, and the foetus 
 tak^n away. The methods of remedying these pre- 
 sentations must be left to the practitioner, and are 
 chiefly the same as those required in like cases at- 
 tendant on ordinary parturition. When delivery is 
 completed, the cleansing must be taken away by 
 adopting the method before advised for its removal. 

After abortion, even in cases where the cleansing 
 has been expelled, a discharge of a peculiar kind 
 usually flows from the uterus for several weeks suc- 
 cessively. It is different in character from the natu- 
 ral lochia, and if so copiously secreted a^ to interfere 
 with the comfort and health of the animal, we may 
 advantageously counteract its ill effects by occasion- 
 ally syringing the uterus with tepid water and dilu- 
 ted solutions of the chloride of lime. Sulphate of 
 iron in half-ounce doses, finely powdered, and given 
 twice daily among a mash, will be found a very use- 
 ful tonic; it also seems to possess some effect in ar- 
 resting the discharge and in restoring the mucous 
 membrane of the uterus to its healthy tone. 

Cows, and especially young ones, which have abort- 
 ed, and have had great difficulty in delivery or in 
 getting rid of the cleansing, are frequently a long 
 time before they will again "take bull." This indis- 
 position for sexual connection with the male, indu- 
 ced by injuries which the uterus has sustained and 
 the shock which the system as a whole has received, 
 is best overcom*^ by giving tonic medicines, using 
 every possible local application to restore natural tone 
 in the uterus, and especially by allowing plenty of 
 good food, air, and exercise. Inflammation of the 
 uterus sometimes succeeds abortion ; it is induced 
 most frequently by the rough usage to which the 
 uterus is occasionally subjected, and is known by the 
 animal becoming feverish, being off her feed, breath- 
 ing quickly and laboriously, arching the back, strain- 
 ing, and voiding considerable quantities of brownish- 
 looking fluid, tinged with blood, which, in advanced 
 stages of disease, is mixed with portions of the inner 
 lining of the uterus, emitting a highly offensive 
 odor. 

In treating this affection the uterus must be fre- 
 quently but gently syringed with tepid water ; hot 
 sacks or cloths wrung from hot water must be laid 
 on the loins ; the bowels must be kept gently open 
 by means of mild laxative medicines if required, 
 and plenty of tepid water or gruel must be given to 
 drink. When a favorable change is about taking 
 place, the uterine discharge becomes lighter in color, 
 and eventually assumes the character of pus ; return
