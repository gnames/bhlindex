of the appetite speedily fellows, and a rapid abate- 
 ment of the fever is also obvious. This disease, when 
 owing to a considerable rent or tear in the uterus, is 
 generally fatal in a day or two. 

There arc some few cases in which death succeeds 
 abortion in a remarkably short space of time, and 
 seems to come on without any apparent cause. It 
 ■will, however, generally be found that in instances 
 of this description the cow has been roughly han- 
 dled, has been many hours and may be days, in pain- 
 ful laboi", has had little nourishment afforded, and 
 was, perhaps, constitutionally weak in the outset. 

Practice of Shoeing Horses. 
 By Charles Percival, Veterinary Surgeon, Roy- 
 al Artillery. 

Mr. Editor — Sir : I have lately been devoting 
 much attention to shoeing, and flatter mysell that 
 the horses under my care are as well shod as any in 
 her majesty's service. 

The shoe I found in use here was made concave 
 next to the foot, and flat on the ground surface, than 
 which, in my opinion, nothing can be worse. This 
 shoe I have had reversed, making the latter as con- 
 cave as the foot will possibly admit of, leaving only 
 sufficient room between the shoe and the foot for the 
 pricker to pass freely round, to remove dirt, &c. To 
 the heels of the shoe I have given an inclined plane 
 outwards on the foot surface, with three nails on the 
 inside and four on the outside. The heels, instead 
 of being cut off straight, are well sloped, and about 
 the same thickness as the toe. The shoe one third 
 as thick at the heel as the toe, recommended by the 
 late professor, the majority of our horses could not 
 travel in. There are many pernicious practices 
 which smiths in general, if leit to themselves, fall 
 into, viz : 

Mutilating the frogs by improper cutting. I have 
 at length got my farriers to understand, that the on- 
 ly part of the frog which ever requires cutting, un- 
 less ragged, is the point, to prevent the sensible frog 
 being bruised between it and the coffin bone. 

2. Infiicting serious injury to the crust, by an im- 
 proper use of the rasp, but especially the coarse side 
 of it. 

3. In fitting the shoes, by cutting too much out of 
 the crust at the toe, to admit the clip. The shoe is con- 
 sequently set too far back, instead of being fitted full 
 to the crust, and afterwards rasping away the crust, 
 making the foot in fact, to fit the shoe, instead of the 
 shoe to fit the foot. This is a faulty practice, and 
 very seriously so, which smiths in general are very 
 apt to fall into ; one, too, which renders the crust 
 shelly, for that part into which the nails are driven 
 from time to time, is in this way rendered weak. 

4. In turning shoes, smiths in general do not at- 
 tend sufficiently to bevelling or sloping the edge of 
 the shoe, from the foot to the ground surface, which 
 I consider of great importance, especially if horses 
 are given to cut or interfere in their action. 

5. Cutting the heels of the shoe off straight. This 
 is also a very bad practice. If well sloped, like a 
 shoe for hunting, to which there cannot be afty ob- 
 jection, they are less li.able to be pulled off by the 
 hind shoe catching in them, and contribute more to 
 the safety of both horse and rider. 

6. Leaving the inner edges of hind sJioes at the toe 
 sharp, which, if rounded, will in a great measure pre- 
 vent overreaches, as well as render the fore shoes less 
 liable to be pulled off by their catching in the heels 
 of the former. Squaring the toe of the hind shoo 
 for horses that forge, or "carry the hammer and 
 pincers," aa it is termed, leaving the horn projecting 

over the shoe, is, in my opinion, good as a general 
 rule, not only preventing that unpleasant noise, but 
 rendering horses less liable to overreach and pull off 
 their fore shoes, provided, however, attention be paid 
 to rounding the inner edge. 

7. In rasping the under part of the clinches, far- 
 riers are yery apt to apply the edge of the rasp im- 
 properly to the crust, forming a deep groove round 
 the same, which cannot but be injurious to the foot, 
 and, together with taking away too much of the crust 
 in finishing off the foot, must have a tendency to ren- 
 der it shelly. Curving the shoe at the toe, after the 
 French fashion, where horses go near the ground, I 
 am very fond of; but I cannot see any advantage in 
 it as a general practice. — Veterinarian.

Adaptation of Crops to Market. 

The farmer who is wide a.vake to his business 
 should watch, as we'l as follow, the markets. He 
 should know what crops will sell well. So far as he 
 can form a probal)le or approximate opinion on this 
 point, he should conform his cultivation to it. In 
 some places, lie can produce milk to advantage; in 
 others, butter or cheese. Again, he may be so situ- 
 ated that neither of these articles will pay him so 
 good a profit as some others. Here his main crop 
 will be hay, there fruit; here potatoes, there squash- 
 es and other vegetables. 

A farmer in Beverly, last year, raised on two and 
 a half acres of land 18,000 cabbages per acre, the 
 nett receipt of which averaged him $J50. Another 
 f^irmer, in Danvers, cultivated an acre of land with 
 sage, and realized the handsome profit of $400. The 
 cultivation of the onion in this latter town gives em- 
 ployment to many hands, and ia the source of largo 
 profits. 

Other examples might be cited to illustrate the im- 
 portance of adapting crops to the markets, such aa 
 the production of the smaller fruits in the neighbor- 
 hood of cities. It is not the crop on which the farm- 
 er himself sets the highest value that should be rais- 
 ed by him, but the crops he can produce at the least 
 expense, and sell to the greatest pr.)fit. 

Some farmers are fearful of loss, if they diverge 
 from the beaten track. They go on, therefore, culti- 
 vating the same products, an! often on the same 
 fields, as did their fathers. Other fiirmers seem to 
 entertain the opinion that unless they raise the heav- 
 ier products — corn, and potatoe-^, and grain, and hay 
 — thev are no longer farmers, but a sort of market 
 gardeners. 

But away with such idle fears and foolish notions I 
 Let our farmers study their true interests. Lot them 
 not stand still while others are going ahet d. Let 
 them be up and doing something to supply the wants 
 of the towns and cities in their vicinity; and not the 
 necessities only, but the tastes also. Let them raise 
 flowers, even, if it will pay a profit! Why not? Tho 
 taste for flowers is an innocent and rational one; why 
 should it not be gratified? 

There arc many articles not yet cultivated to any 

extent among us, that may doubtless be raised to 

advantage. For example, some vegetable product, 

such as the castor oil bean, might be introduced and 

raised, to afford an oil for a domestic light, or for 

mechanical purposes. Whale oil cannot be produced 

fast enough to supply the demand. Some substitute, 

I drawn irom mother earth, will doubtless be soon in 

troduced. Sunflower seed might, perhaps, be found 

' to answer. But we must leave the subject for the 

j present, hoping soon to resume it. — Plough, Loom
