grounds for the Public Squares which are now its j 
 chief ornaments, is well worthy of imitation through- 
 out the State. Independent of the increased value j 
 for residences of adjacent property, their exceeding | 
 beauty, and advantage in respect to health; there is | 
 ailso, we think, a high moral influence of no mean 
 importance on the population of a Urge city, exerted j 
 by these open spaces, tastefully laid out and inter- : 
 spersed with fine trees and shrubbery, llyde Parke, 
 in London, consists of 800 acres. Regents Park of 
 330, with its Royal Botanic and Zoological Garden, 
 the latter of 20 acres. Fifty thousand petiple, of all 
 classes,of a fine afternoon, often resort to these parks 
 for health, recreation or pleasure, and the extent of 
 their beneficial influence can hardly be estimated. 

In addition to her public square already planted. 
 West Chester, with a population of 3000 inhabitants, 
 is supplied throughout with pure spring water,thrown 
 up to the reservoir, in one corner of the square, and 
 which is the highest ground in the Borough. The 
 streets and public and private buildings are lighted 
 with gas. It contains a new CoHvt House, costing 
 near $60,000, with six majestic cast iron columns of 
 the Corinthian order, in front, with onen space all 
 round it, planted with trees; a Bank, of pure white 
 marble, with pillars of the Doric order, a HoHicultur- 
 al Hall, costing $6000, in the Norman style, the 
 second only in the Union, built by a Horticultural 
 Society for Horticultural purposes, a Cahiad of na- 
 tural science, containing the best collections in the 
 State, out of Philadelphia; a Jail, built within a few 
 years, of substantial construction, and the first for 
 solitary coufinemout, of any interior county in the 
 State or country, and seven large buildings for pub- 
 lic worship, including a large Catholic chapel just 
 erecting. The site of the Borough is on elevated 
 ground, nearly 500 feet above tide-water,and overlook- 
 ing one of th<3 most beautitul and best cultivated ag- 
 ricultural districts in the Union, We have already 
 one Railroad connecting with the Columbia Railroad, 
 und a CROWING attachment to Philadelphia, now 
 progressing to completion, in the shape of a Direct 
 Railroad, which will bring us within twenty-six miles 
 of it, and less than one hour apart, and which 
 it is expected will be reciprocated by many of its 
 citizens, and business men, adopting West Chester, 
 as their permanent residence, so soon as it is comple- 
 ted. In addition to the above. West Chester is ccl- 
 brated for the excellence of her schools. In addition 
 to several small ones, it contains three large Board- 
 ing schools, all well filled and flourisiiing. That of 
 A. Bolmar is widely and favorably known over tlie 
 Union, many of our public men having been educat- 
 ed under his care, and his .scholars coming, many 
 of them, from the S juthcrn States, Mexico, and the 
 West Indies. His building is large and imposing, 
 and in the general management of the school, system 
 of thorough instruction, conveniences and comforts 

in and out of doors for the students, its grounds well 
 planted with fine evergreen and Deciduous trcc8,some 
 of large size, and in its large and well kept garden, 
 is acknowledged to be the best private establishment 
 in the United States. There is attached to it a farm 
 of over 100 acres of excellent land. The fine herd 
 of Durham cows, and other superior stock, the Farm 
 buildings, cow house, conveniences for boiling food 
 for stock, and the neat and successful management of 
 the Farm, shall be adverted to at another time. 

We had intended only to speak, in this article, of 
 the Public Square at West Chester, but these other 
 matters have unintentionally leaked out, and as they 
 are generally secrets known only to a few, we let 
 them go forth, and are willing to compare notes with 
 any other town in Pennsylvania of twice the size. 

*There are 238 trees and shrubs in the Square, 
 comprising about 160 distinct species. 

The following account of the successful removal of 
 large trees, and of a kind too, more than usually 
 difficult to transplant, even when small, is extracted 
 from a recent number of Ilovey'e Magazine. As it 
 lias been, done, and at a comparatively small expense 
 for trees *'30 to 40 feet high," and with a variety gen- 
 erally deficient in much fibrous root, we consider the 
 success, in this case, the most remarkable we have 
 heard of in this country, 

'Dear Sir: — The accompanying shellbarks — well 
 ripened; as you will find them — grew, this season, 
 upon a tree which my brother and myself transplant- 
 ed twenty-one months ago, i.e., in January, 1851. 
 The tree was moved, at the same time with three 
 others, a distance of two miles, by what is called the 
 frozen-ball method of transplanting. It is now in a 
 fine healthy condition, and, with the others, — all of 
 whicli are over thirty feet, and one of them forty feet, 
 in height, — serves at once for ornament and shade. 
 Upon our new place, they produce a fine e3ect in 
 taking oS" and relieving the inevitable rawness of a 
 recent settlement. 

Thinking that a simple statement of these fact« 
 might encourage others to do likewise. I have written 
 these few lines. Knowing — as no one better does 
 than you — the great diffK-ulty of transplanting our 
 hard-wooded forest trees, particularly the oak and 
 several speci; s of the hickory, you will concede t at 
 our experiment h;is been eminently successful. The 
 expense of tiansplanting did not exceed twelve dol- 
 lars p-.ir tree. 

Do not r»'gard this on my part as a piece of boast- 
 ing, but simply as a word of encouragement to those 
 who arc compelled to h)cate tliem.selves and their 
 household gods upon a naked j^pot of earth. The 
 statement, yo\i perceive, is of what ha.tbt'en done, not 
 what may If done. What has nrtvalhj transpired, it 
 seems to me, is worth a great deal more to j'our read- 
 ers than speculations in regard to what is possible to 
 be done 1 

Truly your friend,
