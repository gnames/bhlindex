Oyster Shells for Fruit Trees. — A correspon- 
 dent writes to the Germantown (Pa.) Telegraph, as 
 follows : 

One of the most effectual applications I have ever 
 maile to fruit trees in an old and barren situation, is 
 a compost in which finely broken oyster shells were 
 the principal ingredient. The shells have generally 
 a large per centage of saline matter attaching to 
 them, in a fresh state, with some animal matter and 
 much lime. By breaking them and mixing them 
 with wood ashes, nnd spreading it thickly around old 
 trees, and almost immediate and decided improve- 
 ment will take place. 

Young Stock. — These should not be left entirely 
 •without grain during winter. The raw materials for 
 the formation of muscles, bones, &c.,are not contain- 
 ed in sufficient quantities in the long provender used 
 for winter feeding. — [ Working Farmer.

CULTURE OF CRANBERRY VINES. 

The variety cultivated mostly in England are har- 
 dy and prolific. 

They can be raised on upland on rather moist 
 loom — but do the best on low, damp or moist Meadow 
 Land, with a little sand put around the plant. 

They may be planted out IJ to 2 feet apart each 
 way. 

Two feet apart, it will take 10,000 plants to the 
 acre; if on low ground it should be pared, plowed, 
 or burnt over to take out the grass or weeds, and cul- 
 tivated for one or two years, until they cover the 
 ground. The yield after that is from 150 to 250 
 bushels per acre. They are usually gathered with 
 a Cranberry Rake, to be found in any Agricultural 
 Store. 

It is not necessary to flow Meadows in order to 
 make them productive. 

PRICES— Under 500, fifty cents per 100; under 
 5,000, forty cents per 100; over 10,000, thirty cent* 
 per 100. For sale by
