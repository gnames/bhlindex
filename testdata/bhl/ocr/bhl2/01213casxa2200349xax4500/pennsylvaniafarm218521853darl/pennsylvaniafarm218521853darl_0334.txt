IMPORTANT TO FARMERS ! 

HE farmers who make the most money are those who take 
 advantage of all improvements in agricultural implements or 
 stock, so as to receive in return for their labor as large a 
 yield as possible. The truth of this assertion will be admitted by 
 every one. The only ([uestiou then, the fanner has to decide when 
 about to purchase a new implement is. which is the best ? To 
 those in want of a Wind Mill or Grain Fan, 

Bamborougu's Improved Fanning Mill 
 is confidently ottered as the lerj/tc.-t article of the kind that can be had 
 itsadvantages over all other Fans can be told in a itw words, viz : 
 it will do more and belttr ivuilc in le.\s time and Willi less labor than a ny 
 other dcsciiption of fan ever iiffcred to the public, ^n proof ol this 
 statement, / rel'cr to the eight fliousand farmers in the United 
 States who have used my fans, and to the proceedings of the v»ri- 
 ous State and county Agricullu.al Societies held within the last 
 six years, at which my Fan was. in all cases, awarded the highest 
 premiums over numerous competitois I A large number of silver 
 medals and diplomas can be seen by calling at my shop

 ed :

Mr. Bamborough--Dear sir : 7 see by the reports of the diffe- 
 rent Agricultuial exhibitions that you have been getting more pie- 
 miurns and honors for your celebrated patent grain fan. And why 
 should you not ? Vciu surely are justly eiititledtoanyth.it were 
 awarded you. In mv opinion, I he equal to your fan is nowhere 
 to be found, much /ess its superior The millers say to all the 
 farmers who hrin;; in their wheat 'that it is not very clean ; thvt 
 they ought to get a mill like /got of you to clean their wheat, for 
 we have no use for rolling screens or smut machines, for any grain 
 cleanedon the mills /gotof you. JOHN T. N/CHOLaS.

TO FARMERS— SALINE FERTILIZER. 

This preparation is designed to furnish the s lil the various min- 
 cal or inorgauie m iterials abstracted from it by plants in the pro- 
 eress of vegetation. 

It contains a large proportion of the salts of potash soda and 
 ammonia, combined with Bi-Hhosphate of Lime, Animal Charcoal 
 and other fertilizing matter ; the whole forming a highly concen- 
 trated manure 

In thusoffering a new article to the attention of fariners, the re- 
 iative value of which remains to be tested by experience, it is de- 
 sired not to venture upon any assertions respecting it, calculate! 
 to excite expectations, which, perhaps, might not be rcslized ; 
 knowing, however, that the principal constituents of this com- 
 pound have been proved to be highly valuable separately, it is 
 confidently believed that their combination in proper proportions iu 
 the '•Saline Fertilizer" will formau excellent manure. 
 DIRECTIONS FOR USE, 

The Fertilizer should be applied atthe rate of two barrels to the 
 acre, and spread broadcaston the surface 

If, (m opening the hariels. the salts should be found adhering to- 
 gether in lumps, they should be broken, say with the back of a 
 shovel, upon a tloor or smooth surfaee, and, if convenient. a little 
 gcod dry mould may I e added, and well mixed before spreading 

For wheat or rye one barrel per acre may be used bel'orc sow- 
 ing, and lightly harrowed in. and the other applied as a top dress- 
 ing early in the spring, atthe commencementof the first thaw. 

Upon grass it should be sown broad-cast, and if possible, when 
 the ground is wet, or when there is a probability of ram, to dis- 
 solve the ferliliziiig salts : generally late in the fall or early in the 
 spring, will be found to answer best. 

Upon corn, it would perhajis be advisable to apply one barrel in- 
 tlie hill, and one broad cast. 

If added to the manure or compost pile, the Fertilizer willdoubt* 
 less incresse greatly the efficacy of the mixture 

The experience of Agricu turists wiil probably suggest other 
 modes of employing it. as soon as they become satisfied of its utili- 
 ty. It should not, however, in any case be mixed with quick-lime 
 which will cause a loss of ammonia, nor should it be buried deeper 
 iu the soii.
