The Srst concludes plaster is of no use, and 
 80 informs his friends and neighbors that he has tried 
 it fairly, and it is money thrown away. All within 
 his influence are thus discouraged from using plas- 
 ter. His neighbor tells a different tale, shows its 
 good effects, and plaster becomes a jmnacca for im- 
 proving land. One of our best farmers, who has 
 been in the habit for many years, of applying con- 
 siderable quantities of both lime and plaster, tells 
 us that on one occasion, where the plaster fell short 
 of going over the entire field, leaving a whole land 
 across it untouched, this part could be observed at a 
 distance by its increased luxuriance over the rest, 
 indicating there was an excess of sulphate of lime, 
 already in the soil, and that more produced a posi- 
 tive injury. The same discrepancy is found to ex- 
 ist with respect to lime and barn-yard manure, little 
 or no advantage often resulting from their application 

ular crops. The different results in these ca- 
 ses, is owing to the variable composition of the soil, 
 and we refer to them as an illustration of the impor- 
 tance of analysis — as indicating what is deficient, 
 and enabling us to supply it. Because a certain 
 manure has failed or succeeded under certain circum- 
 stances, is no more proof that it will do the same in 
 every other soil and situation, than that because the 
 Laplander can digest whale oil and tallow candles, 
 the same articles are suitable food for residents of a 
 tropical climate. The organic food of plants, con- 
 stituting over 90 per cent., is derived chiefly from the 
 atmosphere; the remainder, or inorganic constituents, 
 solely from the soil, and these, although in such 
 small proportions, are equally necessary with the 
 others. The following tables, giving the composition 
 of several of our cultivated crops, will be found 
 useful : 

it wants, so as to form the basis of improvement. 
 We consider it thus far as certain as mathematics, 
 and its great importance, to the skilful farmer, cannot 
 be too highly estimated. Plants, like animals, seem 
 to have their instincts for certain kinds of food, and 
 differ in their powers of selection and assimilation ; 
 the ash of different varieties, never exhibiting, on 
 analysis, the same composition. No substitutes will 
 answer. Hay, for instance, exhausts the soil of silica, 
 lime, potash. No application of soda, magnesia, or 
 chlorine, which it contains in very small quantities, 
 will supply this deficiency. 
 It does not seem to us necessary that farmers should 
 qualify themselves to analyse their own soils. The 
 practical part of farming is amply sufficient to occu- 
 py their whole time, without attention to the labora- 
 tory. An analysis will not often be required more 
 than once, but we hold it to be indispensable to cor- 
 rect and profitable management, that they should, 
 in all cases, know the constituents of their soil, be- 
 fore they can judge what fertilizers are wanting, or 
 in what quantities they should be applied. 

In Maryland, a State Chemist is employed on a 
 fixed salary, to analyse soils without expense to the 
 farmer. There has been no liberality of this kind, 
 as yet, in Pennsylvania, but we hope there soon will 
 be. We have heard there is an agricultural chemist 
 in Philadelphia, of some experience in this way, but 
 we do not at present know who he is or where to be 
 found. If any of our readers have this information, 
 we shall be obliged by hearing from them, as our 
 farmers are making inquiries of us on this subject. 

The theory of rotation is founded on the fact that 
 every kind of plant requires its specific food, the 
 amount of which is of course diminished by the pro- 
 duction of every subsequent crop of the same kind. 
 Although analysis may sometimes fail of giving the 
 exact proportions, it may be relied on safely for in- 
 ^icatinc' the general character, what it has and what

Cuttiug Corn-fodder. 

Enos Smedley, of this county, and of many years' 
 experience as a dairyman, informs us of his great 
 success the present winter in keeping his cows on 
 corn-fodder, cut and crushed by a horse-power and 
 machine. His plan is to cut off a foot or eighteen 
 inches of the butts before putting it through the ma- 
 chine. This is worked on the barn floor, with a one 
 horse power, and the cut fodder discharged through 
 a funnel into the entry below, contiguous to the cow 
 stables. Here it is emptied into a l.irge box made 
 for the purpose, and holding about 34 bushel baskets 
 full. This is well mixed up with an equal number 
 of quarts of meal, and the whole slightly moistened. 
 He has 34 cows fastened up in separate stalls, and 
 one bushel.heaped up, is found sufficient for a cow at a 
 feed and they are ted twice a day, eating it up clean. 
 Under this management they are improving finely, 
 and wintering as well as they usually do on the best 
 hay. 

One sheaf of fodder cut up, making two good feeds, 
 is worth here, about three cents, making 21 cents per 
 week. Sixteen quarts of meal per week for each cow 
 is worth 32 cents. Total for keep of cows each, per 
 week, 53 cents. This is cheap wintering, and a strong
