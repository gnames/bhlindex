SALT FOR ANIMALS.

purpose of obtaining salt, so necessary to their well 
 beinji;. Our cattle have not the use of an intelligible 
 epecch, but "actions sometimes speak plain as 
 ■words," and the actions frc({iie-at\y manifested by cat- 
 tle for salt cannot be misunderstood. They mean, give 
 us salt; the cravings of nature require it, and most far- 
 mers believe the fact. Therefore, some good farmers 
 always keep salt in troughs, under cover of a shed, 
 where their cattle have access to it through the year. 
 In such cases, it is probable the cattle just take what 
 is necessary, no more, no less. Others give salt to 
 their cattle, sheep, &c., once a week ; whether this 
 ia as often as is necessary, (especially in the early 
 part of the pasturing season, when the grass is ten- 
 der and succulent,) admits of some doubt. Besides, 
 they may eat too much at such times fi)r their health, 
 and the weaker ones may not obtain their share. 

Chemical analysis long ago taught us that the 
 bones of animals were cliiefly formed of phosphate 
 of lime ; but it was not known till the publication of 
 a work on animal physiology, by Professor Liebig, 
 some three or four years ago, that the chloride of 
 sodium, (common salt,) and phosphate of soda were 
 invariably found in the blood, and that the phosphate 
 of potash and the chloi'ide of potassium were of con- 
 stant occurrence in the juice of the flesh. These 
 facts pi'ove that these substances are indispensable 
 for the healthy process carried on in the bhjod, and 
 in the fluid of the muscles. Says the Professor, — 
 "Proceeding on this assumption, the necessity for 
 adding common salt to the food of many animals is 
 easily explained, as well as the share which that salt 
 takes in the formation of blood, and in the respirato- 
 ry process. It is a fact now established by numer- 
 ous analysis, that the ashes of inland plants, grow- 
 ing at a certain distance from the sea, contain no 
 soda, or only traces of that base. The potashes of 
 inland countries rarely contain any carbonate of so- 
 da, while the ashes of the same plants, growing in 
 maritime countries, near the sea-coast, contain phos- 
 phate of soda and common salt ; therefore, the food 
 of animals is not in all places of the same quality 
 or composition, in respect to the two bases, potash 
 and soda." 

"An animal feeding on plants which contain phos- 
 phates of other bases, along with some compounds of 
 Boda or sodium, produces in the body the phosphate 
 of soda, so Indispensable to the formation of the 
 blood. But an animal living Inland, obtains In the 
 weeds, herbs, roots and tubers which It consumes, 
 only salts of potash. It can produce, from the phos- 
 phates of lime and magnesia, by decomposition with 
 the salts of potash, only 2-tJiosjj7iaie of potash, the 
 chief inorganic constituents of its flesh, but no plios- 
 pJiate of soda, which is a compound never absent In 
 (healthy) blood. When, in inland countries, the 
 food docs not contain common salt enough to pro- 
 duce the phosphate of soda necessary for the forma- 
 tion of the blood, then more salt must be added to the 
 food. From common salt is produced. In this case, 
 by mutual decomposition with the phosphate of pot- 
 ash, or with earthy phosphates, the phosphate of so- 
 da of the blood. 

"The phosphate of soda is Indispensable to the 
 normal constitution of the blood, and that the pro- 
 cess which go on in that fluid cannot be replaced by 
 phosphate of potash, seems to me to be an opinion 
 fully justified by the properties of these two salts." 

It seems to me, there can be no doubt In the mind 
 of any one, of the correctness of the views of Profes- 
 sor Liebig, in regard to the utility of supplying farm 
 stock with salt, In sections of the country remote from 
 the sea-board, especially when we take hia views in 

connection with other familiar and well-established 
 physiological facts. 

Phosphoric acid and lime are indispensable in the 
 formation of the bones of animals, and no other sub- 
 stances will answer that purpose. If the hay or grass 
 upon which a milch cow is fed. Is deficient in phos- 
 phoric acid and lime. Instinct points out a remedy ; 
 the cow takes to eating bones, to supply the deficien- 
 cy of the bone earth In her natural food. If she can- 
 not obtain a sufficiency of phosphates for her milk, 
 and to supply the daily waste going on in her bones 
 and other portions of her system, emaciation and 
 weakness follow, and some;times death, from what is 
 called the "bone disorder," A certain remedy for 
 this disease Is found In giving to the cows the fine 
 bone-dust from the button-mould factories. A gill a 
 day, given to a milch cow for a few weeks, will cure 
 her of a propensity to eat old bones, and restore her to 
 health and strength. There Is no theary about this, 
 It Is a matter of fact. I have procured several bar- 
 rels of the bone saw dust from the button factory at 
 Brighton, as a medicine for the cows of farmers and 
 others In this vicinity ; and the past summer I fur- 
 nished to a number of farmers the ground mineral 
 phosphate of lime for the same purpose, and with 
 equally good results. Lime is the principal mineral 
 ingredient In the formation of an egg shell. If a hen 
 is shut up, and fed wholly on food containing no lime, 
 she may occasionally lay an egg, but it will have no 
 shell. A hen can no more generate lime than she 
 can gold or silver ; nor any more transmute any oth- 
 er mineral substance Into lime, to form her egg-shell, 
 than she can produce the new three cent pieces of 
 coin from gravel stones. Sulphur Is a prominent 
 constituent of the yoke of an egg, that is derived 
 from the food upon which the bird subsists. No oth- 
 er substance will supply its place In the formation of 
 the perfect egg, and "any bird which can organize a 
 perfect egg, without a particle of sulphur to enter In- 
 to the composition of Its yoke, can create p.nJ lay a 
 little world, with all Its Inhabitants." 

The blood of animals is made up of globules, some 
 of which are white, and others red; the red globules 
 owe their color to the oxide of iron. In those diseas- 
 ed states of the blood In which the red particles are 
 deficient in quantity, the functions of life are lan- 
 guidly performed ; by the administration in medicine 
 of the salts of Iron, the florid color of the blood and 
 complexion is restoi'ed, and the general state of the 
 health is improved. Probably, from some disarrange- 
 ment of the assimilating vessels In those persons 
 whose blood is deficient In coloring matter, the ves- 
 sels do not take from the food sufficient Iron ; there- 
 fore. In such cases. It is given direct, and In larger 
 quantity than is usually found in the food, and with 
 good results. 

Common salt Is a combination of muriatic acid with 
 soda, an element, (in connection with certain acids,) 
 so necessary to a healthy state of the blood. Clover, 
 red-top and herd-grass, grown near the ocean, con- 
 tain so much salt as to render the salting of the cat- 
 tle fed upon It unnecessary, while the same kind of| 
 grasses grown here, some GO or 70 miles inland. Is so 
 deficient in soda, that it becomes a matter of much 
 consequence that our cattle should be supplied with 
 salt, for a certain amount of soda, from some source 
 or other. Is required in the blood, and required, too, 
 by a law more Immutable than that of the Modes and 
 Persians. 'TIs this law that induces the "salt hun- 
 gry" cow or horse, to lick, for the half hour together, 
 an old cask that has been used for saltmg meat.—
