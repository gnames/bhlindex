Sowing Corn for Fodder.

M. Editor: — I observe in a late number of the 
 Michigan Fanner, an inquiry for the best mode of 
 raising corn for fodder, and having tried several dif- 
 ferent ways, the results may be of benefit to others. 

A common, and a very objectionable practice, is to 
 sow broadcast. This requires at least four bushels 
 to the aero, and even with this amount of seed, the 
 growth is not dense enough to keep down the weeds, 
 and as a consequence, the ground is left in a foul 
 condition. 

The best way is to sow in drills. First plow and 
 harrow the ground, as if for corn or potatoes ; run 
 furrows in one direction, with one horse, about three 
 feet apart; with a hand-basket of corn on the left 
 arm, walk rapidly along-side of the furrow, strewing 
 the seed with the right hand, at the rate of about fifty 
 grains to the foot, which will be about two bushels 
 and a half to throe bushels per acre. A little prac- 
 tice will enable any one to do this evenly and expe- 
 ditiously. The seed may be covered in the best man- 
 ner, by means of a one-horse harrow, a one-horse 
 cultivator, or a two-horse harrow, passed lengthwise 
 with the furrows. Two men will thus put in five or 
 gix acres in a day. 

The only subsequent culture needed, is to pass a 
 one-horse cultivator between the rows, when the corn 
 is about a foot high. No hoeing is required. Its 
 growth will soon cover the whole ground, and all 
 weeds, no matter how thick they may be, will be 
 completely smothered and destroyed ; and when, at 
 the close of summer, the crop is removed, the ground 
 will be left as smooth and clean as a floor. No crop 
 have I ever seen equal to this, for reducing grassy, 
 weedy soil, into mellow condition, in a single sum- 
 mer. 

If the crop stands erect, it is most conveniently 
 cut with a stiff scythe. A little practice will enable 
 the workmen to throw it all in an even swath, with 
 the heads in one direction, so as to admit of easy 
 binding in bundles. If much thrown down by storms 
 it must be cut with a corn cutter. When bound, it is 
 to be put up in large, substantial shocks, to stand 
 several weeks, or till winter, unless the ground is to 
 be sown with wheat, in which case, the crop must be 
 drawn off, and deposited to dry, elsewhere. 

Every beginner spoils his first crop, by its heating 
 in the stack. Even after drying several weeks, there 
 is moisture enough in the stalks to cause violent fer- 
 mentation. The only mode of preventing this disas- 
 ter, is either to leave the shocks on the ground till 
 winter, or to build very small stacks, with throe rails 
 placed upright together at the centre, for ventilation, 
 and applying plenty of salt. 

Fodder thus grown, and well cured and salted, is 
 greatly preferred by cattle, to hay. A neighbor 
 thinks three tons are as good as four tons of good 
 hay. It should be grown so thick, that the stalks 
 will be quite small ; then they will be wholly eaten 
 by cattle, and none lost, 

I have tried different quantities of seed per acre, 
 and find that a much less rate than about tliree bush- 
 els, is attended with a diminished crop, although the 
 stalks may be taller. One bushel per acre, will yield 
 but little more than half as much. 

I usually obtain, on land that will yield thirty or 
 thirty-five bushels of corn per acre, from four to six 
 tons per acre of dried fodder. Counting all expenses, 
 including interest on fifty dollars per acre for the land, 
 the dried fodder, as an average for five or six years 

East, has cost me about one dollar and a half per ton. 
 [ay is usually sold here for six or seven dollars a 

ton, and sometimes for ten. Yet it is astonishing 
 how reluctant our farmers are in adopting the corn 
 fodder cultivation. I hope the farmers of Michigan 
 may set a better example of economy. 

The best variety of corn appears to be that which 
 will afford the greatest number of stalks to the quan- 
 tity of seed sown. Coarse fodder is not as good as 
 fine. A rather moist soil is best, as immense quan- 
 tities of moisture are thrown off by such a mass of 
 leaves. 

Besides the cheapness of this crop, and the great 
 ease of its cultivation, it possesses the following ad- 
 vantages: 1. It may be sown after the hurrying 
 work of spring is accomplished, or at the end of 
 spring, or early in summer. 2. It may be harvested 
 after the wheat and hay crop are secured, or during 
 the comparatively leisure season at the close of sum- 
 mer. 3. Not yielding any grain, it does not exhaust 
 the soil, and is, perhaps, the best crop to precede 
 wheat. 4. It is an admirable crop for smothering 
 and destroying weeds and grass. 

A brief glance at the advantages of the general 
 cultivation of this crop, may not be out of place. The 
 value of the annual hay crop in the United States, is 
 about one hundr'sd millions of dollars. Those who 
 have already adopted the corn-fodder crop, winter 
 their cattle at less than half their former expense. 
 Would it, therefore, be extravagant to believe that 
 one quarter of the present expense in the use of hay 
 throughout the country, would be saved by its gene- 
 ral use ? Yet one quarter is about twenty-five mil- 
 lions of dollars yearly — enough to endow agricultu- 
 ral schools, and build railroads by the score — and is 
 well Avorthy of some exertion for its introduction at 
 large. — Michigan Farmer. t.

Within a few years past, several publications, pur- 
 porting to treat upon the rearing and management of 
 domestic poultry, have been issued from the Ameri- 
 can press. Some of these works are more re-issues 
 of foreign authors, while others assume an air of 
 originality, and profess to guide and instruct the far- 
 mer in all the d tails and management of an Ameri- 
 can poultry yard. With a single exception, however, 
 any one or all of these publications may be read by 
 the farmer, and he will close the volume with the 
 feeling uppermost in his mind, that tlio information 
 most desired, has not been obtained. True, he may 
 have read with some degree of interest the origin 
 and history of numerous varieties of "fancy fowls," 
 (which seems to make up the sum and substance of 
 most works on poultry,) but in this roal-izing age, the 
 farmer turns to his books for a more reinunerativo 
 kind of information. lie expects to be told how to 
 make his poultry profitable, and when he can see for 
 himself by the facts and figures of an experienced
