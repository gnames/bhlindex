POULTRY HOUSES.

yard can be made as profitable as any other branch 
 of farming, he will be likely to treat them with the 
 same consideration that he docs his more costly De- 
 vons and Durhams. 

In the book before us there is more of the right 
 kind of information for the poulterer, than in any 
 publication that has heretofore come under our no- 
 tice. The author, C. N. Bement, is eminently a 
 practical man, and the name of the author alone, is 
 an ample guaranty that his neat little volume is pre- 
 cisely what it professes to be — a practical treatise on 
 j^he rearing and management of domestic poultry. 

With many years experience in the management of 
 his own extensive poultry yards, he is enabled to give 
 his readers the actual facts and figures in regard to 
 profits and expenses, the most economical kinds of 
 food, and many other important results to be obtained 
 only by close personal observation and experience. 
 But, we will let Mr. Bement speak for himself, and, 
 as a convenient poultry-house is the first and most 
 important, we might add, indispensable arrangement 
 for the successful poulterer, we will select two of his 
 best plans — the first, somewhat costly and ornamen- 
 tal, the other cheap and plain : 

OUR OWN POURTRY HOUSE. 

The above figure represents the front and elevation 
 of rather an extensive and costly establishment, 
 which Avould be very convenient, and add much to 
 embellish the premises. The buildings at the ends 
 are intended for laying, hatching, and roosting apart- 
 ments. Tlie cupulas on the tops are finished with 
 blinds, for the purpose of ventilation as well as or- 
 nament. On tlie bottom of the cupolas, and inside 
 of the building, should be a door, hung on hinges, 
 with a cord attached passing through a pulley, so 
 that it may be closed or opened at pleasure, to ven- ] 
 tilatc when required. In the gable ends, if facing ! 
 the south, dove cotes may be formed; or they may 
 be made in the roof, as in the figure. 

The long building with windows in front, connect- 
 ing the two extreme ones, is intended for a storm- 
 ?iouse, chicken saloon, or walk, for exercise in the win- 
 ter, as well as a retreat from storms, feeding, basking, 
 gravel, sand, lime, &c. ; being made wai-m by filling 
 in with brick, or lathed and plastered, and the roof 
 should be thatched with straw. The front should be 
 ten feet high, roof sloping to the north. The win- 
 dows are intended to admit heat in winter, as well as 
 light. If only for a storm-house, the windows may 
 be omitted, and the front finished in the form of a 
 shed. It will be found very convenient for feeding 
 and watering, as well as fur gravel, ashes, lime and 
 eand. Boxes fur nests may also be placed there for 
 laying and hatching. By partitioning it off, two va- 
 rieties of fowls may be kept separate ; or one side 
 may be appropriated for turkeys and guinea-hens, 
 and the other to the gallinaceous tribe. Doors from 
 each should open into the yards, which should be of 
 considerable size ; say, at least half an acre for two 
 hundred fowls, as room and space in the air is neces- 
 sary for their iiealth, when they are not permitted 
 the range of the barn-yard. The yard should, if 
 possible, be a little sloping, that it may dry, as mois- 
 ture is a most destructive enemy to poultry. It should 
 be enclosed by a fence, at least seven feet high, with 
 long, sharp pickets, and the timbers on which the 
 pickets are nailed, unless some distance below the 

top, should be on the outside, to prevent the fowls 
 perching on them, as they seldom attempt to fly over 
 a fence without alighting. When first confined, if 
 they have been used to roam over the premises, they 
 will show some impatience, which soon wears awaj', 
 if everything else is made agreeable to them. It 
 may, however, be necessary to clip the wings of some 
 of them, when first introduced, particularly if taken 
 from the barn-yard, where they have always had 
 their liberty. My fowls are so attached to the yard 
 that they are unwilling to leave it, even when the 
 gates are open — the efi"ect of education. 

The buildings at the ends should be thirteen feet 
 square, and thirteen feet posts. We name this size, 
 as there would be no waste of timber, being just the 
 length of the boards and joists. If not too near the 
 dwelling-house, so that there would be danger of fire 
 from sparks, we would recommend to have the roof 
 thatched with straw, as being much warmer in win- 
 ter, and cooler in the summer, and when well done, 
 it forms a light and durable roof, and will last for 
 twenty years. It should, however, be made very 
 sloping, in order to carry ofi" the water more readily, 
 A hole one foot in diameter, about two feet from tlie 
 ground, with a door, either to slide, or hung on hing- 
 es at the top, which may be held open by means of a 
 cord, should be made in each department, for the 
 fowls to pass in and out, and to confine them when 
 necessai-y. There should be no floor in the first story 
 to prevent the fowls from coming to the earth ; and 
 the litter should be often removed, and the bottom 
 sprinkled with lime, at least once in each week. 

In the second story, there should be a tight floor 
 under the roosts to catch the droppings of the fowls, 
 by which means the apartment can bo kept much 
 cleaner, and the manure may be saved and sold to 
 the morocco dressers, for which they readily pay eigh- 
 teen cents per bushel; or it may be gathered for 
 manure, which, with the exception of pigeon's dung, 
 is said to be the strongest of all animal excremeuta 
 — it is home-made Guano. This will add an item to
