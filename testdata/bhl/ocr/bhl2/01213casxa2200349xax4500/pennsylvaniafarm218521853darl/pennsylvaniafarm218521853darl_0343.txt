the profit of keeping fowls, that has heretofore been 
 entirely overlooked. 

The roosts should commence on one side, at the 
 top, near the plate, and slope down^.vards, at an an- 
 gle of about 45 degrees, like a ladder, to vrithin eigh- 
 teen inches of the floor. The spars for the roosts 
 should be about two inches square, with the corners 
 taken off, and placed eighteen inches apart horizon- 
 tically, for the fowls, and at least two feet for the tur- 
 keys, so that they may not incommode one another 
 by their droppings. No flying is necessary in this 
 form of a roost, as the birds ascend and descend by 
 eteps. It is recommended by some writers, to have 
 the spars or cross-pieces for roosting, of sassalras, 
 two inches in diameter, with the bark on, which is 
 said to be a protection from vermin — in which, how- 
 ever, we have no faith. 

The lower story is designed for the laying and 
 hatching apartment. When we first erected our poul- 
 try house, we tried ranges of boxes similar to those 
 generally made for pigeons, placed against the sides 
 of the walls for nests — but experience, the best of 
 teachers, proved it Avas erroneous, especially when 
 hatching; for when the setting hen left her nest to 
 procure her food, drink, &c., one of the other hens 
 would espy the eggs, and pop in and lay her egg. In 
 the mean time, the hatching hen would return and 
 find her nest occupied ; and finding it no easy matter 
 to eject the intruder — as possession, with hens, like 
 men, is considered nine points of law — would seek 
 the first nest she could find with eggs, and settle her- 
 self there very contentedly. The consequence was, 
 the other hen, after depositing her egg, would leave 
 the nest, and the eggs would cool and spoil. There 
 is another difficulty. If vermin should make their 
 appearance, there is no way of getting at them or 

cleansing the nests ; to remedy *^his, we had separate 
 boxes made and hung around the sides, and placed 
 in the corners, which can be removed when hatching, 
 or cleaned and freed from vermin when necessary. 

The foregoing plan, though "rather costly," as the 
 author remarks, is very complete in its arrangements. 
 We had a building erected from this design — 90 feet 
 by 13, brick walls, shingle roof, plastered inside, the 
 wood-work thoroughly coated with Chester county 
 mineral paint, and the establishment furnished with 
 laying boxes and feeding hoppers, after Mr. Bement's 
 designs, as described below — the cost of the whole 
 being $500. The "storm-saloon" has some seventy 
 feet of glass front, the temperature in which, without 
 artificial heat, averages about 40 degrees in ordina- 
 ry winter weather. During the extreme cold of last 
 winter, when the mercury ranged at Zero, the water 
 in the saloon was frozen. Along the back wall of 
 this saloon we have a row of laying-boxes, fifty in 
 number, which will accommodate at least 300 hens, 
 as they prefer laying several together in the same 
 nest. This building will accommodate about 500 
 fowls — we have some 400 in at present, without being 
 at all crowded- 

The "New York Poultry House," figured below, 
 of the same capacity, can be erected at one fourth 
 the cost, and will answer every purpose for those who 
 are not disposed to indulge in a more "fancy" estab- 
 lishment.

After detailing the conveniences and manner of 
 construction of several establishments, we come now 
 to a very simple, complete, and to our mind, a very 
 efficient fowl-house, as given by a correspondent un- 
 der the uignature of 11., in the American Agricultu- 

rist. The writer says, "The accompanying plan and 
 references render a particular description unneces- 
 sary. The north, oast and west sides of the house 
 are of brick; the floors are of cement to keep out 
 rats.
