But, except in the case of very porous rocks or ac- 
 cumulations of earthy matter, these surface waters 
 rarely descend to any great depth, and hence after 
 sinking through a variable thickness of subsoil, we 
 come, in general, to earthy layers, in which little 
 vegetable matter can be detected, and to which the 
 lime, iron, and magnesia of the superficial covering 
 has never been able to descend. 

Thus the character of the soil is, that it contains 
 more brown organic, chiefly vegetable, matter, in a 
 state of decay — of the subnoil, that the organic mat- 
 ter is less in quantity and has entered it chiefly in a 
 soluble state, and that earthy matters are present in 
 it which have been washed out of the superior soil — 
 and of the subjacent mass, that it has remained near- 
 ly unaffected by the changes which vegetation, cul- 

ture, and atmospheric agents have produced upon the 
 portions that lie above it. 

From what is here stated, the effect of trenc i and 
 subsoil ploughing, in altering more or less materially 
 the proportions of the earthy constituents in the sur- 
 face soil, will be in some measure apparent. That 
 which the long action of rains and frosts has caused 
 to sink beyond the ordinary reach of the plough is, 
 by such methods, brought again to the surface. When 
 the substances thus brought up are directly beneficial 
 to vegetation or are fitted to improve the texture of 
 the soil, its fertility is increased. Where the contra- 
 ry is the case, its productive capabilities may for a 
 longer or a shorter period be manifestly diminished.

Farmers' Boilers. 

We insert engravings of two patterns of boilers for 
 boiling and steaming food for stock, with the results 

below of some experiments, showing the advantages 
 of cooked over uncooked food. They maybe obtain- 

ed at any of the agricultural warehouses, at pri- 
 ces varying from $G 50 to ?25 00, according to 
 size. This mode of preparing food for stock, is part 
 of the improved system of farming, which farmers 
 must come to, if they regard their own interesta. 
 There is no doubt about this. It is only a question 
 of time. The sooner it is adopted, the greater the 
 profit.

 Prof. Mapes — Dear Sir: — Enclosed you have an 
 account of my recent experiment, made at your re- 
 quest, in feeding cattle with cooked feed, di'C. 

I selected two pair of cattle from among eight pair, 
 which were similarly conditioned, and which I had
