I have often remarked with what seeming confi- 
 dence some of the learned gentlemen who undertake 
 to analyse a sample of soil for the sum of five dollars, 
 to he paid by a confiding farmer, report the result of 
 their labors, and then vouchsafe to give their advice 
 founded on the analysis. In the April number of 
 1852, of the Working Farmer, is contained one of 
 those singular productions from the pen of Prof. J. J. 

Mapes. 

The learned Professor first states the result of the 
 analysis as follows :

If we assume that an acre of ground contains 
 30,172 bushels of soil,each bushel weighing 90 pounds, 
 we will have 2,715,480 lbs. of soil, and if it contains 
 45-100 of lime, we will have 12,200 lbs. of lime to 
 the acre, (equal to IGO bushels.) But we see by the 
 second column, that the learned Prof, has set down 
 the required amount at 3-100, or in other words, at 
 81,404 lbs. We then must supply 09,204 lbs., which 
 would be no less than 1,080 bushels of lime. 

Experience has taught the farmer that a dose of 
 fifty bushels of lime will be a sufficient dressing for 
 almost any land. If such is the case, this soil already 
 contains more than three times the re(j[uired amount. 
 By the analysis, this soil contains 102 busliels to the 
 acre, and yet the learned Prof, says that lime is de- 
 ficient. 

The reader will perceive that no care has been 
 taken, in making this analysis, to ascertain in what 
 state this 102 bushels of lime already in the soil ex- 
 isted. No attention is paid to its state of combina- 
 tion. We have carbonic acid, .81, more than enough 
 to saturate the whole of it. If this lirac was then a 

carbonate, surely any small addition such as is usu- 
 ally made, would not be of much utility. But here' 
 in is the difficulty. These examinations, (for I wil 
 not dignify it by the name of an analysis, when any 
 gentleman devotes no more than five dollars worth of 
 time and labor to it,) are entirely useless, and only 
 calculated to load persons into error. If the rcadei* 
 will add up the sum of the constituents, he will find 
 that they produce 99.80, and that the learned gentle- 
 man reports to have found a trace of magnesia. 
 This latter is to account for the 20-100 missing in the 
 sum total. The operator must have acquired an ex- 
 traordinary degree of exactitude in his chemical 
 manipulations, to have been able to arrive at such a 
 result, without compiling it from many trials, and 
 averaging the errors. But at five dollars no man can 
 make the salt that it would take to his bread, even 
 to make one analysis of a soil, much less to make 
 twenty, and by averaging the difierences, be able to 
 bring it out like a balance ^heet, with nothing Car- 
 rie 1 to profit and loss. To ascertain any proportion 
 below 1-100, requires the most delicate kind of man- 
 ipulation, and is attended with much labor, and can 
 only be relied on when repeated trials have been 
 made. 

If the 10:^. bushels of lime already in this soil are 
 insufficient, it is not because that amount of lime 
 would not answer the purposes of agriculture, but 
 because the lime was in combination with something 
 that hindered it from subserving the purposes which 
 I have already laid down in a former article. The 
 gentleman who so positively lays down that it is de- 
 ficient in lime, does not appear to have taken any of 
 these matters into consideration. If I am correct in 
 my views, the soil may require lime, notwithstanding 
 the presence of even 3-100, provided such lime is com- 
 bined so as to render it useless to the soil. But much 
 less than one-half of one per cent, of lime combined 
 with carbonic acid will be found to be sufficient. As 
 to any man under the advice of a consulting agricul- 
 tural chemist, being induced to put lime enough on 
 his land to bring it to 3-100, I have nought to say, 
 but that in my neighborhood it would make quite a 
 sensation. 

Some of the most fertile alluvial land in Ohio con- 
 tains but a shade over one-half of one per cent, of 
 lime, but this lime is a carbonate.

 out of grain by using salt. Sprinkle a little fine salt 
 on the bottom and around the sides of the bin as you 
 fill up, and over the top when full. Wheat kept in
