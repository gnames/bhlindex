PENNSYLVANIA SEEDLINGS— GUERNSEY LILY.

Fig. 3, Smokehouse apple. This is the favorite of 
 this section of country, and is esteemed, wherever 
 known throughout Pennsylvania, for its being so long 
 in use, uniformly fair appearance, and abundant and 
 regular bearing. It is a very crooked grower, both 
 in trunk and branches, with dark-colored wood. The 
 original tree grew on the farm of William Gibbons, 
 in Lancaster county, near his smoke-house, whence 

its name. Many fruit growers in this State, if con- 
 fined to only one variety, would select the smoke- 
 house. Size above medium, oblate, regular, mottled 
 and striped with red on a yellow ground ; stalk -} to 
 I inch long, slender ; calyx closed, set in a wide and 
 shallow basin ; flesh yellowish white, rich, aromatic, 
 fine sub-acid flavor. Ripe in October, and will keep 
 for several months.

Messrs. Editors: — 

Your interesting reference to 

the many interesting things which Horticulturists 

might expect from Japan, induces mo to copy and 

«end you the following. I find it in the Appendix to 

Berry's history of the Island of Guernsey, published 

80 long ago as 1815: Have we this flower? 

D. 
 The Guernsey r,ily. 

This beautiful flower, known throughout England, 
 by the name of Guernsey Lily, and cultivated to 
 such perfection in this island, where the natural 
 soil is so congenial as to require but little of the gar" 
 dener's care,is nevertheless a native of Japan,brought 
 into Guernsey by the effect of accident, more than a 
 century since, when a vesssel from Japan, having 
 gome roots of this flower on board, being cast away 
 upon this island, they were washed on shore, and 
 buried in the sand, where they remained unobserved 
 till the beauty of the flower attracted the attention 
 of Hon. Charles Ilatton, (son of Lord Ilatton, then 
 Governor of the Island,) a great florist as well as 
 botanist, who knew the value of the prize, had them 
 carefully transplanted, cultivated the plant himself, 
 and sent roots of it to many botanists and florists in 
 England, where it is much admired, and has to this 
 day continued a great favorite, and is now generally 

known after the name of the Island, which has cer- 
 tainly been its foster-mother, but mentioned under 
 the name of Narcissus Japonicus rutito flore,by Cor- 
 natus. Narcissus of Japan, or Guernsey Lily, by 
 Eoclyor,in his Kalendarum Ilortense; Amaryllis Sar- 
 nieusis, by Linncus; and by different authors by va- 
 rious names. I was favored with a long descriptive 
 account of this flower,in a work written by Dr. James 
 Douglas, printed in London in 1725, called Lilium 
 Sarniense, wherein every particular is scientifically 
 treated upon; but as their technical terms can alone 
 amuse the learned florist and botanist, I shall refer 
 them for this minute detail to the work itself, and 
 content myself with some few particulars respecting 
 the general nature and cultivation of this plant, 
 which cannot fail of being acceptable to all. They 
 have a light earth made with dung and sand, and a 
 little lime rubbish with it does very well, it keeps 
 the root sound; for if the earth be too stiff or wet, 
 you may keep them for many years before they b'ow. 
 If they are in pots, they should be put in the house 
 in winter, to keep them from the severe frosts, which 
 are apt to rot the roots. The time of moving them is 
 when they have no leaves on the root, that is from 
 June to August; those that come with six leaves sel- 
 dom fail blowing the next year, and never bloom till 
 the plant has attained that number of leaves. They 
 need not be put into fresh earth above once in two or 
 / three years. By this method of management, Fair-
