lyx is rounded, the flowers have nearly always color, 
 whilst those of the Tea Roses, (with which this class 
 ia in close relationship) are, with few exceptions, 
 pale white or yellowish. It is also to be observed, 
 the flowers of the Bengal Roses are very seldom 
 scented. Examples: Bengale Ordinaire, Cram jisie 
 Superieure, Prince Eugene, Eugene nardy,Beaucar- 
 min da Luxembourg, Augustine Hersan, &c. 

Class?. — Tea Roses — The branches have a very 
 smooth bark, and have not many thorns. Tlie 
 leaves are glossy, and the flowers appear on the top 
 of the branches, Avhich are slender and not very long. 
 In most cases, the weight of the flowers bends the 
 branches, so that only their under-side is seen. Vig- 
 orous examples produce sometimes stronger shoots, 
 which are not so flexible, and bear three or often five 
 flowers on their end, as Devoniensis, Safrano, Souve-

Prospects of the Farm Journal. 

We in this number commence with an improve- 
 ment in our paper, by transferring all our advertise 
 ments to the cover, which will add about four and 
 sometimes more additional pages of reading matter 
 to each number. This has involved the expense of a 
 new fount of type, and very considei'able expense in 
 other respects, but we consider it will greatly en- 
 hance its value to our subscribers, and when bound' 
 make a much more valuable volume, by embracing 
 only reading matter, without the advertisements. — 
 The latter, it will be observed, are printed in neat, 
 clear style; our circulation extends through every 
 part of our own, and considerably into other States, 
 and offei's a valuable medium of advertising on all 
 matters pertaining in any way to Agriculture and 
 Horticulture. 

The Farm Journal is now permanently establish- 
 ed at West Chester. It is the only strictly Agricul- 
 tural paper in Pennsylvania. The present proprietors 
 undertook it with the determination, as far as in 
 their power, to make it fully equal to any Agricultur- 
 al paper in the country, and worth3^ of the patronage 
 of the farmers of our own State. We acted on the 
 presumption that there was enough Pennsylvania 
 feeling, and State pride, to sustain a good paper 
 within our own borders, in preference to those pub- 
 lished in other States, if it was as well conducted. — 
 Not that we wish to object to our farmers taking 
 these others, by no means, but only that they should 
 not be the means of excluding our own Farm Journ- 
 al. There are eleven or twelve Agricultural papers 
 published in New York, and a very material part of 
 their support comes from Pennsylvania. We do not 
 ask for subscriptions, as a gratuity. We expect to 
 give the worth of every dollar we receive. Tho.se 
 who think it is not worth the price of subscription 
 (only 75 cents to clubs) had better not take it. 

We also hope to be assisted by many of the able 
 pens throughout the State, resuming tiicir correspon- 
 dence in its pages, and to those who have heretofore 

written for it, as well as to others who have facts or 
 information of value, in any department of Agricul- 
 ture or Horticulture, Ave now tender an invitation 
 to send us their articles for publication. 

We wish to make the Farm Journal emphatically 
 a Pennsylvania Paper. We have the means of do- 
 ing this if properly sustained, by a little exertion on 
 the part of those who think the effort worth making. 
 If our fi-iends in any part of the State would get us 
 up clubs of subscribers in their respective neighbor- 
 hoods, it would much as.-ist us in showing that our 
 efforts to benefit the farmer^' interests are apprecia- 
 ted.

Portrn its of Improved Stock. 

On account of the condition animals are usually in 
 at this season of the year, it has been thought best to 
 postpone for a time, the illustrations and portraits 
 which we have in prospect for the pages of the Farm 
 Journal. Some of the very best animals in the 
 country, of various breeds, are only being delayed 
 for a milder season, till they can be daguerreotyped. 
 We have determined that hereafter, no mere artistic 
 figures, and highly flattered, unnatural specimens of 
 stock, which have so abounded in some of our agri- 
 cultural periodicals, shall be admitted into its pages. 
 If a high-priced Cow, or Bull, or Sheep is so deficient 
 in good points and general figure, that it will not do 
 to tell the truth in a real portrait, they had better be 
 sent to the butcher. A $10 note may be thus saved 
 in paying an artist, who to gratifj^ the wish of the 
 owner, to make an improvement on nature, might as 
 well make the drawing from description,'Kithout ever 
 seeing the animal. 

As we remarked in a former number,wlien introdu- 
 cing the Southdown Sheep of John AVorth and Joseph 
 Cope, (which, by the way, had not justice done them 
 by the engraving,) there is much difiiculty in getting 
 an artist sufficiently acquainted with the points of 
 good stock, to be able correctly to draw an animal 
 portrait from life. For this reason, as regards the 
 Pcnnsj'lvania Farm Journal, we shall exclusively a- 
 dopt the daguerreotype process, it being always easier 
 to copy from it than to originate correctly. Where 
 the intention of the owner is truthful there will bo 
 no difficulty. Were this always the case, there would 
 be no such caricatures as we often see. Francis 
 llotch, of New York, so widely known as an experi- 
 enced and successful breeder of both sheep and cat- 
 tle, Id a recent letter to us, coincides so fully witii 
 our vicAvs, that with his permission we mak-i some 
 extracts from his letter, with his remarks on the por- 
 traits of some of the animals figured in the transac- 
 tions of the New York State Agricultural Society. 
 Some of these appear to be unfaithful likenesses in 
 not coming ttp to the reality. In this case, as in the 
 other of going beyond it, they had better not be pub- 
 lished.
