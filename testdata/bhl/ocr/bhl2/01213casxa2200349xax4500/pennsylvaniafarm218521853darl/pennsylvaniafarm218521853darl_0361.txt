TheCommitte regret that in so large a Common- 
 wealth, and such an extensive field for competition, | 
 there were not more applicants, although it was to ' 
 have been expected, that erne or two seasons would 
 elapse before farmers would feel sufficient emulation 
 to accurately survey and measure an entire crop for 
 80 small a premium as is awarded. 

The written statements of competitors are very 
 satisl'actory f)r first reports, many of them being full 
 and specific upon every point, except it be the nett 
 cost per bushel or per acre. We have no doubt this 
 defect will be corrected in future. The Committee 
 deem the rules of the society to have been complied 
 with by most of the competitors, and we find no diffi- 
 cuity in making the awards. After a careful examin- 
 ation and comparisim of the different statements and 
 samjiles, whicli are herewith submitted to the Soci- 
 ety for examination and distribution, the Committee 
 award as follows: 

Geo. Walker, first premium for best five acres of 
 corn, $15 00. 

Also a complimentary premium for the same, of 
 Jjff.'/ dollars.

SECRETARY'S REPORT. 

The closing of the second year of the Pennsylva- 
 nia State Agricultural Society, furnishes the evidence 
 that its organization has been for good, and that it 
 has received attention from its friends, commensurate 
 with the importance to be attached to an institution 
 intended to foster and improve Agriculture, Horti- 
 culture and the Domestic and Household Arts. It 
 has also afforded sufficient proof that there does exist 
 in Pennsylvania, all the elements required to carry 
 forward and foster successfully a State Agricultural 
 Society. 

The proceedings of the year, which are those of 
 the Executive Committe, have been nearly altogether 
 of a business nature, and are made upfront the min- 
 utes of said committee, which has been in session 
 eight times since the last annual meetin* of the So- 
 ciety. A very considerable amount of time and la- 
 bor is required from, and has been cheerfully given 
 by the members of the Executive Committee, upon 
 vi'hom has devolved all the business of the associa- 
 tion. 

The following resolution was passed by the Execu- 
 tive Committee, at their meeting on the 10th of De- 
 cember, 1852 : 

" Resolved, That experience has shown that our 
 Annual Exhibitions have heretofore been held top 
 late in the season, and that our next Annual Exhibi- 
 tion and Cattle Show shall be held on Tuesday,Wed- 
 nesday, Thursday and Friday, the 27th, 28th, 2yth 
 and SOch days of September next." 

In accordance with the Constitution of the Uuited 
 States Agricultural Society, which makes provision 
 for the establishment of a* Board of Agriculture, to 
 be appointed by the respective State Agricultural So- 
 cieties, the Executive Committee has appointedFred'k 
 AVatts, John II. Ewing, and H. W. M'Allister, mem- 
 bers of the said Board of Agriculture. 

It was also resolved that tlie thanks of the Society 
 be tendered to the Agricultural Society of Lancaster 
 county, for the industrious attention which they have 
 given *^to the interests of the State Society during Its 
 exhibition, and especially to their Executive officer, 
 Daniel Rhoads, for his untiring energy in executing 
 the orders of the Committee of Arrangement. 

The Committee appointed to receive propi)sajsJrom 
 places competing for the next Annual Exhibition, 
 reported progress and had leave to report at the next 
 meeting of the Committee. 

The Committee appointed to audit the accounts of 
 the Treasurer, reported and certified to the correct- 
 ness of the same. 

It is to be regretted that none of the different coun- 
 ty Agricultural Societies in the State, have complied 
 with the Act of Incorporation of the State Society, 
 which requires that they shall annually transmit in 
 the month of December, to the Executive Committee, 
 "all such reports or returns as they are required to 
 demand and receive from applicants fur premiums, 
 with an abstraetof their proceedings during the year." 
 An adlierence to that part of the law requiring 
 them to make report of their yearly ]>roceedinga, 
 would enable the State S unety to acquire a great 
 store of agricultural information, from the various 
 districts, and a sufficiency of agricultural statistics to 
 warrant the Legislature in following the wortliy ex-
