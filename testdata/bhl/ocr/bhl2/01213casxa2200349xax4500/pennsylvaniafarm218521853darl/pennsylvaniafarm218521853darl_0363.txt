to have succed the first effort calculated to benefit 
 the farmer, the Legislative aid so confidently to be re- 
 lied on, the members of the Society now numbering 
 thousands, the money in its treasury, and the wil- 
 lingness of almost every one to assist in its promo- 
 tion, all indicate a permanency of the Pennsylvania 
 State Agricultural Society, which it is hoped will not 
 cease while agriculture contributes to the comfort 
 and happiness of man. 

R. C. WALKER, Sec'y. 

Geo Walker's Mode of Cultivation. — I plowed five 
 acres of green sward for corn in the beginning of May, 1852 
 and hauled one hundred loads of manure on the same. Af- 
 ter the manure was spread the ground was well harrowed, 
 and planted, the last of May, in rows 3i feet apart, running 
 east and west, from three to five grains in the hill. Two 
 bushels of lime, mixed with three bushels of plaster was ap- 
 plied to said five acres of corn, very soon after it came up. 
 A plow did not enter the field after the corn was planted. 
 The ground was kept loose and mellow, and the grass and 
 weeds subdued by the use of the cultivator ; making but lit- 
 tle use of the hand-hoe. A specimen of the corn was ex- 
 hibited at the State Fair, at Lancaster; it being ol the white 
 flint species, eight-rowed, small cob, and long ears, more 
 than one foot in length. In addition to the enormous yield 
 of 160 bushels of shelled corn to the acre, tlie same fl^ld, of 
 five acres, produced twenty tons of superior pumpkins, some 
 of which weighed more than forty-one pounds. Said field 
 is situated on one of the highest hills in Susquehanna coun- 
 ty, being an oak, pine, beech and sugar maple ridge. Soil, 
 a sandy loam. 

All of which is respectfully submitted.

WooDBOURNE, Susq'a CO., Oct. 14, 1852. 
 The subscribers have this day examined the corn raised 
 by Mr. George Walker, on his farm, at this place. 

AVe measured carefullj', with a surveyor'schain, onesquare 
 acre embracing an average of the field. 

AVe then counted the hills of corn on each outside row, 
 and found it 128 hills long, by 3.3 wide. AVe then selected 
 an average row, and beginning on one side, worked twenty- 
 six hills, which we shelled and measured, and there was a 
 little over a full bushel. 

The corn was not dry, and probably will shrink from J to 
 J. The present araount would be 160 bushels of shelled 
 corn — 120 of dry, merchantable corn.

James A. McCrea's Mode of Cultivation. — The under- 
 signed respectfully presents the accompanying certificates of 
 the measurement of laud, and its product. in corn, in compe- 
 tition for the premium ofi'ered by the Agricultural Society 
 of the State of Pennsylvania. 

In this section of our State, such a crop is exceedingly be- 
 yond the average, and elicited warm encmniums from all 
 who had an opportunity of seeing its luxuriant growth. The 
 moJ.e of cultivation was that usually employed in this coun- 
 ty, viz : 

A sod of more than 20 years growth was broken up in March, 
 harrowed thorouglily, then hoe-harrowed and furrowed out 
 for planting 1 andSi feet. The corn was planted the first week 
 in May, about two-thirds with Dutton and the rest with mixed 
 variety. My neighbor farmers were ot opinion that if the mixed 
 variety alone had been planted, the yield would have been 
 materially increa.^ed. Of this, however, I am not satisfied. 
 The irregular outline of the field rendered it impraeticable 
 to institute a comparison with that accuracy which should 
 always accompany agricultural experiments, to entitle them 
 to confidence. A given bulk of the mixed variety was found 
 to shell off about 4 per cent, more by measure and 8 per 
 cent, less by weight than the Dutton. 

The Dutton corn was selected with reference to its charac- 
 ter for maturing early — as the desire was to bring the field 
 back into grass in the shortest possible time. 

The unusual character of the autumn, however, defeated 
 the object, and also showed no difTorenco in favor of the 
 Dutton over the mixed variety, on the score of earlier matu- 
 rity. I may also aild, that the fodder was very rank on the 

entire field, much of it from 15 to 16 feet high ; none under 
 12 ft. The Dutton corn with us is not often more than nine 
 or ten feet high. 

There was no manure employed, and the rapid growth of 
 the crops did not permit it to be stirred more than twice 
 with the cultivator. JAMES A. McCREA.

Montgomery co., Jan. 6th, 1853 
 I hereby certify that I superintended harvesting and mea- 
 suring the corn crop grown upon 11 acres 21 perches, on the 
 farm of Dr. JamesA.McCrea, in AA'hitemarsh township, Mont- 
 gomery county, and that said crop was 1028 bushels of shell- 
 ed corn. JOSEPH NIEMAN. 

I hereby certify that I measured accurately the field of 
 corn ujion the farm of Dr. James A. McCrea, in August last, 
 and that the same contains 11 acres 24- perches of hind. 
 JOSEPH HUSTON, Surveyor. 

Reuben AVeidman's Mode op Cultivation. — The ground 
 was timothy sod. It was accurately surveyed by AVilliani 
 AA'^eidman, ou the 1st of October, 1852, and found to contain 
 155i perches, less 4i perches than one acre. 

The mode of cultivation was as follows : Ploughed in the 
 spring, thin put in with potatoes, and after they were raised, 
 about 16 one-horse cart loads of manure spread over it, 
 then again ploughed about 8 inches deep and harrowed until 
 in good seeding order; and then sowed in with 1 bu. 3 pecks 
 of what is called the Ohio wheat with drill. The wheat was 
 reaped, shocked, and then stacked and remained there until 
 the 4th day of October, 1852. when it was threshed and 
 yielded tJi!rti/-ciij7it (uxl a half bushels by measure; weighed 
 62§ lbs., whieh makes forty bmhels and twelve and two-third 
 lbs. of wheat bv weight.

Description of the Manner in which John Wilkin- 
 son produced his Crop of Carrots, in 1852, meas- 
 uring 1017 Bushels pier Acre. 

The ground was a good sandy loam, principally mica and 
 slate; the fertile surface soil about eight inches in depth. 

It had been in Lucerne two years previous to breaking up 
 for Carrots. 

The sward was turned undernine inches deep in April, fol- 
 lowing the surface with the subsoil plough, to the depth of 
 six inches more. 

Land was manured with four hundred pounds Peruvian 
 guano per acre, and twenty-five two-horse loads of compost, 
 consisting of the scrapings of the manure yards, screenings 
 of guano, decomposed flesh of Horses, Cows, Ac, and glean- 
 ings from banks of ditches, thoroughly incorporated with 
 the soil. The seed was planted the 5th of May in drill, 2\ 
 feet apart, using two pound seed per acre — the variety Long 
 Orange. 

They were kept clean throughout the season; were hand- 
 weeded but twice, and cultivated principally with horses, 
 using a cultivator made by C. B. Rodgers, of Philadelphia, 
 expressly for the purpose; and also subsoiling the surface, 
 three times during the season between the drills, with a 
 light one-horse plow. The crop was harvested the last of 
 November. They were taken out by means of the largo 
 subsoil plow, running it seventeen inches in depth. 

By the use of the S. S. plow for digging carrots, and sim- 
 ilar roots, a strong team will do the work of twenty-five or 
 thirty men, and do the work cquallj' as well as it can be 
 done by manual labor. 

I preserve them in pits, cover them with earth, without 
 any other covering. I sell them in the city of Philadel- 
 phia for feeding Horses; the price varies from 37i to fifty
