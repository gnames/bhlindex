The statedmeeting occurred Tuesday even'g Jan. 18, 
 in the Chinese Saloon, L>r. W. D. Brinckle, V. P., in 
 the Chair. The severity of the weather precluded an 
 extensive display, yet the commendable zeal which 
 actuates Thomas Meehan, gardener to Mr. Cope, in- 
 duced him to bring from a distance of some miles, a 
 collection of beautiiul flowering plants, much to his 
 credit ; in which were several of interest — the Bde- 
 poroiic Amlierntii, new, and shown for the first time 
 in bloom — RaphwJepis indicn, a large plant in pro- 
 fuse flower, with about one dozen others. From the 
 sam3 source were a handsome bouquet set in a moss 
 vase, and a large moss basket, displaying choice cut 
 flowers ; among the latter was a spike of an air plant 
 the fragrant Stanhopea maculata, presenting a wax- 
 en-like appearance, and odd form. Robert Corneli- 
 us' gardener also brought a design and basket of se- 
 lect flowers. Benjamin Gulliss, a beautiful hand bou- 
 quet. Of fruit, Samuel Ott exhibited seven varieties 
 of apples ; Robert Cornelius' gardener, three kinds.

To the President Pennsylvaniii Horticultural Society: 

The Fruit Committee, in submitting; their usual ad interim report, 
 embrace the opportunity of retuniinK their thanks to those contributors 
 who have, at various times, so kindly and j,'enerously placed before 
 them specimens of so many of the native fruits of Pennsylvania. Be- 
 lieving, as we do, from the evidence already in our possession, tliat our 
 Commonwealth contains many choice varieties of fruit; that her soil 
 and climate are naturally well adapted to its culture; and that her hor- 
 ticultural resources require, for their development, comliined action as 
 as well individual exertion— we hail with pleasure the ertbrtsnow being 
 made for the organization of a State Pomological Society.

 fniits have been submitted for examination;

 We have received from our friend, J. M. McMinn, 
 a full account of the first exhibition of this Society, 
 which appears to have been a very spirited one, and 
 augurs well for the future. We regret that our space 
 will not allow us to publish the awards of premiums 
 in extenso. We copy the following : 

"This Exhibition was held on the 6th, 7th and 8th 
 of October, on the farm of H. N. McAllister, Esq., 
 a short distance to the east of the borough of Bell- 
 fonte. It was extremely creditable to our county, 
 and all were gratified with the fine display of the 
 productions of our farms and gardens. Very few 
 articles of inferior worth were presented, and the 
 judges acknowledged their inability to discriminate 
 justly, ill almost every department of the Exhibi- 
 tion.""
