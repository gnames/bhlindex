Should it bo necessary to let off steam, cover with j 
 something to keep out cold, and prevent a check to

Issued from the United States Patent OfTice. 

AVe shall hereafter continue a monthly notice of 
 all patents issued from the Patent Office relating to 
 agricultural implements and machinery, for the 
 month preceding the issue of our paper. 

R.VK.ES TO Grain Harvesters. — By Jearum At- 
 kins, of Chelsea, Ul. : I do not confine myself to tlie 
 exact nnchanical devices and arrangements describ- 
 ed, for operating the rake, as they may be modified, 
 or others substituted for them. 

I claim the combination of the crane post, rock- 
 shaft, and crank, to operate the jointed arm and 

-By Wm. A. Gates, of ^Mount Comfort, 

Tenn.: I claim the rhomboidal plate, bent on one 
 of its diagonals, and constructed and arranged sub- 
 stantially as described, so that either leaf can be 
 used as a land-side or share, at pleasure, the edges 
 of the share becoming, when the plate is reversed, 
 the edges of the land-side, and those of the land- 
 side, the edges of the share, in the manner and for 
 the purposes specified. 

Grai.v Threshers and Cleaners. — By J. Jones 
 & Alex. Lyle, of Rochester, N. Y. : We claim the 
 combinativ)n of the upright threshing and separating 
 cylinders with the upright concave and cylindrical 
 sieves operating in the manner set forth. 

Maize Harvesters. — By J. L. Ream, of Mount 
 Pulaski, HI: I claim the arrangement of the shaft 
 of the receiving arms, with one end resting upon the 
 cutter bar piece, thereby dispensing with an inter- 
 mediate platform, so that the cut stalks will fall di- 
 rectly upon the receiving arms, and be thence dis- 
 charged in bundles upon the ground as set forth. 

Fulling Mills. — By Wm. E. Underwood, of Mid- 
 dlefield. Mass: I claim the coml)ination of the stop, 
 mechanism or its equivalent, with the screw pulley 
 and the elastic band leading to the pulley on the up- 
 per roller, whereby the whole machine is stopped, 
 when the motion of the cloth is arrested in the man- 
 ner described, and ceases to impart motion to the up- 
 per roller. 

WiNNOwiN'5 Machines. — By Samuel Canby, of 
 EUicott's Mills, Md. : I claim "the combination of the 
 piston, rack-rods, pinion, valves and eccentric pul- 
 ley, in connection with a conducting chest and blow- 
 er, for the automatic graduation or government of 
 the blast through the spouts, of 'a winnowing ma- 
 chine, arranged and operating in the manner and for 
 the purpose set forth. 

Heckling Flax and Hemp. — By J. P. Arnold, of 
 Louisvillr", Ky.: I do not confine myself to any par- 
 ticular form or arrangoraont of the jparts, so long as 
 the machine is so constructed that it, will (;pcrate as 
 set forth. 

I claim the method of heckling ,h?!mp by subject- 
 ing it to the action of a series of mixed beaters and 
 combs, the teeth of the latter being of varying length 
 — s(mie of them projecting so far, and others beyond 
 the beaters, and the whole operating substantially as 
 set forth. 

Also, a rest, having a narrow islot open at one end 
 in comliination with a concave projecting beyond 
 the end of the cylinder at the open end of the rest, as 
 set forth. — Scientific American.^
