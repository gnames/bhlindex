We -vrould then pass on to a third subject, a plum 
 tree having the oxcresences on the branches, remark- 
 in<', "here is entirely a difFeront disease from either 
 of the others, what can be done here," Peter would 
 would walk round and i-ound as before, eyeing the 
 tree most carefully, and deliberately, as if working 
 out some abstruse question in metaphysics, and after 
 considerable pause, like a physician in a critical case, 

would remark, "well now Mr. , in viy opinion, 

the best thing for this tree (emphasizing the word as 
 if a new receipe Avas coming) is to get some soft soap 
 and lye, mix them half and half, take a white wash 
 brush and rub with this mixture iip and down. 

Much amused, wo took him to a Sugar Maple, 
 healthy and vigorous; but with two or three limbs 
 broken and the bark somewhat scaled by another 
 tree falling on it. "Peter, what had better be done 
 here?" He seemed somewhat confounded, examined 
 the tree as before, paused awhile as if in profound 
 thought, and with the greatest gravity remarked — 

"well now Mr. , in my opinion, the best thing 

for this tree, is to get some soft soap and lye, mix 
 them half and half, take a white wash brush and rub 
 with the mixture up and down." It was useless to go 
 farther. Peter was evidently a man of one idea. 
 We followed his advice, however, and found so much 
 benefit from the application to all our fruit trees,that 
 we have recommended it with confidence ever since. 
 Peter scraped the bark off an old Queen apple tree, 
 and applied his mixture pretty copiously, and the 
 next season we had a greatly increased crop of fine 
 fruit. It is a mixture convenient to most farmers.

minute, and thinks it would work at that rate all 
 day." He has also cut with it a dozen large sheaves 
 of oats in one minute. It is constructed on the prin- 
 ciple of the spike grain thresher. 

It can be obtained at the Agricultural Warehouse, 
 in West Chester, and forwarded to any part of the 
 country. Price, $28. 

Potts' Patent Corn Stalk Cutter and Crusher. 

The above is a cut of an excellent machine for this 
 purpose, which is now being considerably used in 
 this neighborhood, and works very satisfactorily. 
 Our position makes us feel some hesitation about a 
 strong recommendation of new implements, but this 
 cutter and crusher has been well tested in West Ches- 
 ter and vicinity. Enos Smedley, an account of whose 
 experiments with cut fodder we gave in last number, 
 says, "he has cut with it two bushels of fodder in one

Italian Rye Grass. 

Can any of our readers give us their experience 
 with this grass, the "Lolium Perenne" of Botanists? 
 Some of our Chester county farmers have used it on 
 a limited scale, and speak of it in the highest terrasj 
 as being of rapid growth, and preferred by stock' 
 even to our natural green grass, "Poa Pratensis." It 
 s called Perennial Rye Grass, from its habit of con- 
 tinued growth through the season, and has been found 
 here to keep green longer than any other variety. 
 The stock keep it eaten down very close. It is sup- 
 posed by some to be preferable to timothy, for mixing 
 with clover, and will bear frequent cutting. Know- 
 ing that it had been considerably grown in the State 
 of Delaware, we addressed a letter of inquiry to Bar- 
 ney Reybold, from which we extract the following: 

In answer to your enquiries I would say, that my 
 experience in its use, has been, that Cattle, Sheep or 
 Horses prefer it either for pasture or hay, to timothy; 
 for pasture it will afford more feed, than any other 
 kind of gi-ass, in iact, it requires to be fed close to keep 
 it from getting rank and going to seed. The quan- 
 tity to be sown per acre is one peck if sown with Clo- 
 ver, and two pecks if sown alone; I sow it either in 
 the fall or spring ; I think it takes the best in the 
 fall, but it does well in the spring, the same time 
 you sow Clover. It ripens for mowing one or two 
 days earlier than Red Clover; it is therefore better 
 to be sown with Clover than Timothy. Its fattening 
 qualities are equal to the best natural green grass. 

In the English works we have examined, it would 
 appear to be annual or perennial according to good 
 or bad soil, being in the latter only annual. It is re- 
 commended by some, and considerably used for 
 lawns, where a compact sod is desired. 

We should be pleased to hear more about it from 
 some other correspondents.

The aggregate wealth of the United States amounts 
 to $12,000,000,000, and the population to 24,000,000 
 of souls. The wealth divided by the population 
 gives $500 to each person, young and old ; and count- 
 ing five persons to each family, it would give the 
 handsome little fortune of $2,000. 

English Game, brought by the steamers, is quite

 and fifty cents each.
