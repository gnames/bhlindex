PROM 1'LAYFAIr's LECTURE OX THE FEEDING OF CATTLE. 

Most farmers are aware of the fact that young 
 calves, sheep and pigs, fatten more quickly in the 
 dark than in the light. Tiie explanation of the iact 
 is simply this, that they pass more of their time in 
 sleep. Sleep is that portion of life of an animal 
 when the principal growth of its body takes place. 
 In sleep all the voluntary motions cease ; vitality, 
 therefore, now increases the mass of the body, as its 
 force is not expended in producing motion. It is for 
 this reason that we like those lethargic pigs which 
 stagger to the trough in a lazy way and sleep as 
 they have finished eating. Very little matter being 
 expended in motion, they rapidly increase in size. 
 The phelgmatic Chinese or Ndpolitan pig fattens 
 quickly, whilst the unimproved, long-legged Irish 
 pig, which gallops about at such an extraordinary 
 rate, expends ail its food in the production of force, 
 and does not grow rapidly. 

Perhaps the greatest refinement in fattening is 
 exhibited in the manner of feeding ortolans. The 
 ortolan is a small bird esteemed a great delicacy by 
 Italians. It is the fat of the bir<l which is so delicious; 
 but it has a peculiar habit of feeding, which is oppos- 
 ed to its rapid fattening — this is, that it feeds only 
 at the rising of the sun. Yet this peculiarity has 
 not proved an insurmountable obstacle to the Italian 
 gourmands. The ortolans are placed in a warm 
 chamber, perfectly dark, with only one aperture in 
 the wall. Their food is scattered over the floor of the 
 chamber. At a certain hour in the morning the 
 keeper of the birds places a lantern in the orifice of 
 the wall; the dim liglit thrown by the lantern on the 
 floor of the apartment induces the ortolans to believe 
 that the sun is about to rise, and they greedily con- 
 sume the food upon the floor. More food is scattered 
 over it, and the lantern is withdrawn. The ortolans 
 rather surprised at the shortness of the day, think it 
 their duty to fall asleep, as night has spread its sable 
 mantle around them. During sleep, little of the food 
 being expended in the production of force, most of it 
 goes to the formation of muscle and fat. After they 
 have been allowed to repose for one or two hours in 
 order to complete the digestion of food taken, their 
 keeper again exhibits the lantern through the aper- 
 ture. The rising sun a second time illuminates the 
 apartment, and the bii'ds, awaking from their slum- 
 ber, apply themselves voraciously to the food on the 
 floor; after having discussed which they are again en- 
 veloped in darkness. Thus the the sun is made to 
 shed its rays into the chamber four or five times every 
 day, and as many nights follow its transitory beams. 
 The ortolans, thus treated, become like balls in a few 
 days. The process speaks much for the ingenuity 
 of its inventor, if it does not for the intellect of the 
 ortolan. In this refined mode of feeding, every con- 
 dition for the fattening of an animal is united — i. e., 
 warmth, plenty of food, and want of exercise. — [New

rials employed in the erection. Of materials, we 
 may observe that stone is of all others the worst; timber 
 and brick are the best. The usual practice of sinking 
 ice houses to a great depth under the surface is bad; 
 indeed, it has only one redeeming property, which is 
 the convenienr-e of filling from the top. Its disadvan- 
 tages are, the diffculty of admitting sufficient venti- 
 lation to correct the dampness, Avhich, build them as 
 Ave may, is sure to exist in under-ground himses, the 
 conduction of heat from the surrounding soil, and 
 the difficulty of effecting sufficient drainage; these 
 very far over-balance the advantages thus ofi'ered. 
 Why are the majority of ice houses and most cellars 
 during winter so much warmer than the surrounding 
 atmosphere? Is it not from the heat conducted 
 through their walls from the surrounding soil? 
 Earth is a much better conductor of heat than 
 air, or, in other Avords, it communicates its heat 
 to other bodies coming in contact with it much 
 quicker than that element. Hence the necessity of 
 plac'ng between the earth and the ice some slower 
 conductor of heat, and the slowest conductors we 
 have applicable to the case are timber, charcoal or 
 air; both also resist damp, while stone does not, and, 
 besides, it is a rapid conductor of heat. Water is 
 also a rapid conductor of heat, and instances have 
 been known, where rain Avater has percolated the 
 roof of an ice house, that the temperature has been 
 raised to sixty degrees. Hence the necessity of 
 keeping such houses perfectly dry, not only at the 
 top, but also throughout, by efficient drainage of the 
 melted ice and by ventilation to correct the dampness 
 in the atmosphere .and Avails. Indeed, the walls of 
 an ice house, to be in proper condition, should be as 
 dry as those of a dwelling. 

The cheapest and best \A^ay of constructing an ice 
 house, is to make its Avails double with a space be- 
 tAveeu them, which should be filled Avith that excel- 
 lent non-conductor, "charcoal dust." Where timbev 
 is the cheapest the house should be boarded inside 
 and out, with the charcoal dust between the Avails; 
 where bricks are cheapest they should be used. 
 Stone may be safely used Avith such a good non-con- 
 ductor botvA-een a double AA'all. Dry saAv-dust is also 
 a good non-conductor, aud it can easily be obtained 
 everyAvhere in our country, but it should not be used 
 unless it is perfectly dry. — [Scientific American. 

Ice House Management. 

This is a matter of no small importance, yet how 
 often do Ave see it treated, not only Avith indifi'erence 
 but upon the very worst principle possible to ensure 
 its preservation; not one ice house in fifty is construct- 
 ed upon the correct principles — not one in the same 
 number is managed correctly. When we consider 
 that damp and heat are the two great agents of thaAA- 
 ing, it should be our endeavor to counteract those by 
 every means in our power. To effect this, ventilation 
 irust be had resource to, and non-conducting mate- 

WooL IN THE United States. — The Economist 
 gfiyg — "By recent scientific researches on the part oi 
 Peter A. BroAvne, Esq., of Pennsylvania, it has been 
 established that the United States can outrival the 
 world in Avool as in cotton. Thus, Spanish sheep, 
 yielding naturally avooI 2000 to the inch, carried to 
 England, degenerated to 1000 to the inch. and brought 
 to the United States, recovered to 2,100, orfiner than 
 the original. The fact; being once established, that 
 our climate and soil produce finer avooI than ether 
 countries, will giA'e to our manufacturers inevitably 
 the superiority in cloths, if the manufacturer is al- 
 lied in his interest to the groAver.

Packing Apples. — The following method is prac- 
 ticed in some parts of Maine for packing apples for 
 shipment to California : Each apple h wrapped in 
 paper, and then packed in the barrel in layers. Be- 
 tAveen every tAVO layers of apples, is a layer of pow- 
 dered charcoal. The apples are thus prevented from 
 coming in contact with each Other, and through the 
 anti-putrescent qualities of the charcoal, the rot, 
 even should it attack a part of the fruit,_Avill be pre- 
 vented from communicating to the remainder.
