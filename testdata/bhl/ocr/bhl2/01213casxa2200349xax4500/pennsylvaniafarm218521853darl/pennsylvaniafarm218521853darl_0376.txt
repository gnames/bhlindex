SUBSOIL PLOW— PEKFECT SHORT -HORN— NEW REAPER, &c. 

MiLRca, 

month there will be scarcely an occupier of stiff, hea- 
 vy, clay soil, who will not have this implement in op- 
 eration; for all those who have used it (and it has 
 been at work a short time already) concur in saying 
 that it docs most effectually fultil all that it pro- 
 fesses. Great credit is due to the parties who have 
 brought their skill and judgement to bear upon an 
 injpleraent which many were 'nclined to think admit- 
 ted of no improvement, but the reverse of which has 
 been developed in so eminent a degree, that we doubt 
 not the inventor will for many and many a year be 
 regarded as one who has conferred a benefit on socie- 
 ty to an extent that, perhaps, he little anticipated.

A Perfect Shoi*t-S:loru. 

"We find in the Wool Grower and Stock Register 
 for November, the following description of a perfect 
 Short-Horn — "furnished by a gentleman well qualitied 
 to speak on the subject.'' It is condensed by the ed- 
 itor as follows: 

The head is the most important part of the whole 
 animal — not on account of its real value, but as form- 
 ing a sort of INDEX to other good or bad points. A 
 good head never yet went with a bad animal, nor an 
 inferior head with a superior animal. The head 
 should be small, the muz^zle tine, and the nose of a 
 rich orange color. A flesh colored nose, or a veri/ 
 light brown, is admissible, but it should never be 
 black. The eyes should be prominent, /itM of intel- 
 ligence, yet evince mildness and good temper. They 
 should be encircled with an orange-colored rim. The 
 ears should be small and thin, and orange-colored 

within. The horns fine, short and waxy, a little flat 
 nest the head, and slightly curved upward. The 
 neck should be fine next the head, and in the cow no 
 dewlap. In the bull a very small dewlap evinces a 
 good constitution — but it should be small and not run 
 down the neck, as this would give the animal a very 
 coarse appearance. The shoulders should be snug, 
 the crops full, the back straight, broad and level, and 
 the ribs round and well spread out. Nothing ap- 
 pears more inferior than a Short-IIoru with a sharp 
 back and flat rib; such an animal can carry but little 
 flesh, and that of an inferior quality. The rumps 
 should be long, broad, and level from the hips back, 
 reaching well down the thigh, yet not far enough to 
 produce coarseness. The tail should be well set, 
 nearly on a level with the back, large where it joins 
 the rumps, but diminishing to great fineness at the 
 brush. The hind legs should stand square, rather 
 wide apart — straight when viewed from behind — the 
 bone small and fine, and the feet light. The fore- 
 legs wide apart, short, small below the knee, large 
 above and increase to great width at the elbow. The 
 brisket, full, prominent wide and deep — reaching well 
 back between the fore-legs, which gives the animal 
 great depth at the girth, and shows also, with width 
 of chest, a strong constitution. There should be 
 great width (especially in the bull,) when viewed in 
 front; his head well set up, joined to an arched ani 
 majestic neck. 

The skin should be soft and pliable, of medium 
 thickness, covered with a soft, fuzzy coat, which, 
 when parted, shall exhibit a yellow skin. The udder 
 when fully developed in the cow, should bo square, 
 reaching well forward and up behind, the teats wide 
 apart and pointing slightly outward— the' udder be- 
 ing well covered with long, soft, silky hair. The 
 colors of the Short-IIorns are red and white— and 
 these colors intermixed, forming red and white, and 
 the beautiful, fixshiouable roan. 

The pedigree should be good, and trace to animals 
 recorded in either the American or British Herd 
 Book, on both the side of the sire and the dam. Per- 
 sons procuring Short-IIarns ought to always require 
 a written pedigree, certified to by the breeder; and 
 they should never purchase an animal as thorough- 
 bred, without a compliance with this requirement.

A New Reaper. 

No improvement in the conduct of Agricultural 
 labor, has attracted so much attention of late years, 
 as the various machines for reaping grain; and yet 
 it is acknowledged on all hands, that all of them are 
 more or less detective, and that there is still "a more 
 excellent way." We are rather disposed to think 
 that that '"more excellent way" has been discovered 
 by one of our own citizens, and that the very best 
 reaping machine which has yet been brought to the 
 notice of the public, has been invented by one of 
 the very numerous family of Smiths, commonly call- 
 ed John IL Smith, of Brooklyn, N. Y. (ofi&ce, 27 
 Nassau street, N. Y.) It is far simpler than any of 
 the reapers yet presented to the public and less ex- 
 pensive. 

The machine is based on a principle quite different 
 from any of the others. Four revolving cradles, sim- 
 ilar to the old-fashioned cradle of the farmer, with 
 fingers, are carried around in a sort of drum, and cut 
 about a foot at each stroke. They carry the grain 
 carefully to the inside of the drum and stand it up 
 in the form of a sheaf, whence it is taken by a man 
 on the machine and bound as the machine passes a- 
 long. There is very little machinery about the in- 
 strument, and the work is done with a certainty, 
 neatness and ease, which exhibits the genius of the 
 contriver. We should say that it would also work 
 with great rapidity, and is so light as to be used 
 with only a single horse. Of course we form our 
 opinion' of what the machine can do by the model, 
 only, as it has not as yet been brought into practical 
 use. Workmen are, however, engaged in manufac- 
 turing the reaper, and it will soon be on exhibition, 
 at Allen's Agricultural Room, in New York. — [Ex-

A New Article of Export.— On Thursday last. 
 Burton Kingsbury, Esq., of Bradford, Pa., shipped 
 seventy-three bushels of acorns for Belgium and Hol- 
 land. Mr. K. is agent for a gentleman of great 
 wealth, owning land in this country, who ordered 
 these acorns for the purpose of introducing the oak 
 in those countries. 

Heavy Loss. — Large quantities of hogs, slaughter- 
 ed in Columbus and Cleaveland, Ohio, and shipped 
 to New York by railroad, have entirely spoiled by 
 warm weather. Twenty-eight car loads in one train 
 became so putrid that the stench was an intolerable 
 nuisance to the villages they had to pass through. —

Next Agricultural Fair. — At a meeting of the 
 Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania State Ag- 
 riculturoJ Society, held at Harrisburg, last Friday, 
 Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday ,the 27th, 
 28th, 29th and 30th of September next, were fixed 
 upon for holding the next State Fair; and a Com- 
 mittee, of which Judge Watts, of Carlisle, is Chair- 
 man, was appointed to receive propositions from the 
 citizens of towns or cities desiring to have the Exhi- 
 bition in their vicinity.
