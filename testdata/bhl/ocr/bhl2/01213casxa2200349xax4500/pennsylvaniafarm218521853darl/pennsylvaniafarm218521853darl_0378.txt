Messrs. Editors: 

"Toby," a correspondent of the 
 Village Record noticed in that paper, a few weeks 
 since, a crop of corn raised by S. J. Diskey & Bros., 
 the past season. We have since received your re- 
 quest to make out for the "Farm Journal" a full 
 statement and method of operation. We take plea- 
 sure in complying. We believe the science of farm- 
 ing, although it is now receiving more nearly than 
 ever before, the attention its importance merits, and 
 is now advancing with rapid strides, fostered as it 
 is by such enlightened suggestions and discoveries 
 as appear in such invaluable periodicals as the "Farm 
 Journal;" yet there is still much to be learned and 
 discovered. 

If one of your correspondents can say any thing 
 that will enable some or one of your readers to raise 
 one bushel more of corn to the acre, he has done a 
 public good. We have been successful in raising 
 some large crops, and give our experience to your 
 readers for what it is worth. 

No. 1 is a small field containing two acres and 
 sixty-four perches. It was in pretty good condition, 
 and had been in grass lor some five or six years. It 
 had been limed twice before, and was limed last 
 spring after the ground was plowed ; it received, al- 
 so, sixteen cart-loads of barn-yard manure to the 
 acre, which was spread on the sod and plowed un- 
 der ; and we may say here, that in seeding corn, we 
 consider the plowing a very important part of the 
 matter. Any person who has observed the enormous 
 mass of roots thrown out by a heavy crop of corn, 
 cannot fail to believe it impossible that they should 
 be all accommodated to advantage in four or five 
 inches of soil. It is our custom to plow from nine 
 to eleven inches deep for corn, and as that cannot be 
 done in a stiff sod with one pair of mules — which is 
 the motive power we use — we always use four, or 
 else a pair of mules and a yoke of oxen together. 
 To this many will object on account of the increased 
 expense ; but we are satisfied that it pays us well in 
 the end. It was a source of considerable difficulty 
 with us for a long time, our not being able to procure 
 a plow that would turn over a furrow slice ten or 
 twelve inches in thickness, to our satisfaction. None 
 of our common plows will do it. We procured some 
 short time ago, however, the "Michigan double 
 plow," which promises to answer our purpose more 
 nearly, although we have not had it long enough 
 to get a fair trial of its merits. This we vplll do the 
 coming spring, and if it answers as well as we ex- 
 pect, we will give our experience respecting it, here- 
 after. 

But to come back to the corn. After the ground 
 was plowed, a very heavy roller was put on it, and 
 the field rolled. It was then harrowed twice across 
 he furrows, with a sharp spike harrow. We then 

put on a large cultivator, over five feet wide, with 
 nine teeth in it ; this goes over the ground three 
 times, or oftener, if the soil seems to require it, and 
 then we finish with a light roller. It is better, and 
 less expensive to work the ground before the corn is 
 planted and up, than after; therefore, we do not 
 spare the harrow, but keep at it until the ground is 
 completely pulverized. After corn is planted, it ia 
 some three weeks before itis up high enough to work, 
 when, if the soil has not been well prepared before- 
 hand, the grass and weeds get such a start that it is 
 next to impossible to keep them in subjection in af- 
 ter culture, and we are decidedly averse to ever at- 
 tempting to raise a crop of grass, and weeds and 
 corn in the same field the same season. 

After rolling the ground the second time, we pro- 
 ceed to plant. In doing this, we invariably use the 
 drill, having found by experience that we can raise 
 about one-fourth more corn to the acre, by drilling, 
 than by planting it in the hill. We make our rows 
 three feet nine inches apart, and leave from twelve 
 to fourteen inches between the stalks in the row, or, 
 if the soil is thin, we increase that distance a few 
 inches. 

After the corn is up high enough to work, Ave put 
 in the large cultivator spoken of before, setting back 
 the two front teeth, and taking out the middle one, 
 so that it can be run over the rows, one half on each 
 side, and is drawn by a pair of mules ; and we go 
 twice along the same row. As there is a person to 
 go after to set up the corn, one setting up does far 
 the double cultivation. 

After standing some two weeks or more, a small 
 one-horse cultivator is put on it, (and, by the way, 
 we think we have the best article of that kind out,) 
 and give it two rounds, or four strokes between eve- 
 ry two rows of corn. We then go after withthe hoe, 
 and cut out any grass that may have escaped the 
 harrow, and also thin out the corn to what we think 
 about right. We never disturb it afterwards, except 
 to sucker it, until it is ready to cut up. 

No. 1 had 289 i- bushels of corn, making 120 bus. 
 and 1 peck per acre. 

The crop on No. 2 was more extraordinary still, 
 considering attending circumstances. About twelve 
 years ago, it was an old field, and had not been plow- 
 ed for forty years, or may be twice that time, and 
 was considered entirely worn out. About 1839 
 we limed it on the top, fifty bushels to the acre. The 
 following spring we plowed it and put it in corn, 
 which yielded about twenty bushels to the acre. The 
 next spring we sowed it in oats, and we received 
 about ten or twelve bushels to the acre. We next 
 sowed it in clover which was suffered to grow up and 
 lay down until the next fall, when it was carefully 
 plowed under, and the ground manured with compost 
 from the stable, (where we make from 150 to 200 
 ' loads of excellent manure every year, and we pur-
