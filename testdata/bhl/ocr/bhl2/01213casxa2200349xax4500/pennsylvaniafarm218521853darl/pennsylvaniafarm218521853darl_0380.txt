That multiplied by II, (the number of lbs. allowed 
 for each square foot of cattle measuring loss than 3 
 feet in girth,) makes 44 lbs. ; which, divided by 14, 
 to bring it to stones, is 3 stone 2 lbs. 

Again, suppose any calf, &c., should measure 4 ft. 
 6 inches in girth, and 3 feet 9 inches in length — say, 

Girth, - 4 ft. 6 in. 

Length, 

9 

Which, multiplied together, makes 16J square ft. 
 The square superficial feet and inches being multi- 
 plied by 16, the No. of lbs. allowed to all cattle mea- 
 suring less than 5 and mjre than 3 feet in girth, make 
 264 lbs. ; which, divided by 14, to bring it into stones, 
 is 18 stone, 12 lbs." 

The dimensions of the girth, and length of black 
 cattle, sheep, calves, or hogs, may be as exactly ta- 
 ken this way as is at all necessary for any computa- 
 tion, or for the purpose of valuation of stock, and 
 will answer exactly to the four quarters, sinking the 
 offal ; and which every man who can get a bit of 
 chalk, may easily perform. These calculations are 
 14 lbs. to the stone, which is the general weight; 
 but it is as easy to divide by any other number of 
 pounds. 

N. B. — A deduction must be made for a half-fat- 
 ted beast of 1 stone in 20, from that of a fat one ; 
 and for a cow that has had calves, one stone must be 
 allowed, and another fornot being properly fat.

 Vegetable Nutrition. 
 A writer in the January number of the Albany 
 Cultivator, has given parentage to a new theory of 
 vegetable nutrition. 

The theory, however, as there laid down, is so in- 
 complete in its details, as not to furnish to the read- 
 er sufficient ground either to adopt or repudiate it. 
 It would greatly aid the cause, if all writers on sci- 
 entific subjects would lend the weight of their names 
 to their productions. I am well aware that in politi- 
 cal discussions, and to mere literary productions it is 
 not required that the author's name be made known. 
 But when a writer enters the lists to combat the re- 
 ceived theories as laid down by such men as Liebig, 
 and Lawes, and many others that I could name, I 
 think the reader entitled to the name of the author 
 of the conflicting theory. I have said that the au- 
 thor has not sufficiently defined his position, and in 
 this I apprehend I will be seconded by every reader 
 of the article in question. Will the author please 
 furnish the readers of the Cultivator with the details 
 of his theory ? When the public are fully informed 
 as to what phenomena the writer contends for, the 
 time for discussion will have arrived, and for myself, 
 I will promise him a patient hearing, and an impar- 
 tial judgment. G. BLIGHT BROWNE.

 DRItMNG WHEAT. 

Report on the best method of putting in Wheat, 
 read before the Union Township Agricultural 
 Club, Dec. 25th, 1852. 

Mr. President, Gentlemen, &c. : 

In accordance with a resolution of our last 
 meeting, by which the question, "Which is the best 
 way to put in wheat — by the plow, drill or harrow ?" 
 was referred to mo to report on, I respectfully submit 
 the following remarks : 

It is a question upon which there is probably as 
 much difference of opinion as upon any one in the 
 wide field of agricultural labor ; and every one en- 
 gaged in the cultivation of the soil, should feel him- 
 self deeply interested with a subject that so materi- 
 ally affects his labor, and determines the success of 
 his prospects. 

Undertaking the task with diffidence, I shall en- 
 deavor briefly to present a few remarks, as derived 
 from observation, inquiry, and such collateral infor- 
 mation as I could command during the limited peri- 
 od assigned me. Not, however, with the view of as- 
 suming the character of dictator, or insisting upon 
 my opinions in preference to those of others, but 
 rather to awaken a spirit of inquiry among those 
 interested, into the different methods, stimulating 
 them to decide their value by the test of utility, and 
 conformity to the laws of nature. 

In determining the manner of sowing or planting 
 any seed, the question first arises — "Where is its nat- 
 ural place of vegetation V Is it upon the surface of 
 the earth, slightly covered, or deep underground? 
 which differs greatly with different seeds. While 
 we find some germinating readily upon the surfixce, 
 others might lie there until entirely decayed, and 
 show no signs of life ; whilst, had they been covered 
 with earth, they would soon have brought forth a 
 new plant. Some vegetate by being put a few inch- 
 es beneath the surface, while others will not germi- 
 nate for a long time, or probably never, unless bur- 
 ied to the depth of twelve to eighteen inches ; and, 
 some again, will not vegetate at all by being put too 
 deep under ground. Thus we see, that in all cases, 
 due regard should be had to the laws of nature. Ob- 
 servation teaches us that wheat will vegetate as read- 
 ily on the surfiice as in any other situation, when 
 combined with a sufficient quantity of heat and mois- 
 ture, which is essential to vegetation in all cases. 
 Most of you who are engaged in fiirming, have no 
 doubt experienced this to your regret and disadvan- 
 tage : when, after having cut your wheat and put it 
 up in the best manner possible, to receive the genial 
 warmth of the sun for a few days, a warm, protract- 
 ed shower of rain fell on it, and on going to your 
 field you found that it had germinated almost instan- 
 taneously, even on the tops of the sheaves ; so that, 
 in many instances, you Avere obliged to open out 
 fhe sheaves in order to dry the wheat and stop its
