a favor could not be refused — and, consequently, I 
 was fairly embarked in an enterprise "fair or fowl," 
 and the result ot which I am now going to state. 

The three eggs I placed under a common hen for 
 incubation, and about the first of August last, had 
 the satisfaction of seeing two chicks make their exit 
 from the eggs, the third one being addled. Fortu- 
 nately these chicks proved male and female. They 
 were well cared for. They soon out-grew all the 
 common stock of the same age. Theyputmcinmind 
 of nothing so much as the story of the boy, who took 
 a night's lodging on a pile of guano : rising in the 
 morning, he found to his great astonishment that his 
 clothes had become far too small to contain his now 
 overgrown carcase. Such appeared my Shanghaes, 
 particularly the male. They have, however, by this 
 time become more respectable in appearance, and I 
 doubt if a more dignified specimen of the feathered 
 "celestial" race could now be found. At six months 
 old the hen weighs 6 lbs. and the male 7^ lbs. Had 
 they been raised in the spring, no doubt their weight 
 would bo considerably more. 

I have already taken up more space than I intend. 
 el, and must now give, in a few words, the main ob- 
 ject of this communication — the result of this small 
 experiment. 

These fowls were hatched on the first of August ; 
 are now six months old. On the 19th January the 
 hen commenced laying, and by the 1st of February, 
 or in 13 days produced eleven eggs, and still contin- 
 ues to drop an egg a day. To compare them with 
 the common fowls, I may say that I have sixty or 
 seventy ranging the yard and barn, from all of which 
 I procured four dozen of eggs during the month of 
 January — less than one egg for each hen in 31 days 
 and the Shanghai hen 11 eggs in 13 days, or about 
 two dozen in one month. It would thus take two 
 Shanghae hens, or say three, to produce as many 
 9ggs in a month as sixty or seventy common hens. 
 Tiiis statement is perfectly true so far as it goes, and 

will probably seem incredible to many. 

It rather exceeds the Rev. A. S. Bumstead's state- 
 ment as given in vol. 1 pg. 19 of Farm Journal, that 
 "one Slianghae cock and two hens will produce more 
 eggs in three month's time, of a greater size and 
 richer quality, than five times that number of ordi- 
 nary hens will do in one year." Some time after 
 this statement appeared in the Journal, '. K. E. of 
 Chester county, see (pg. 174, vol. 1,) gave the editor a 
 pretty hard "hit" in regard to publishing such ex- 
 tracts, and desired that the Rev. gentleman "desig- 
 nate the variety so extraordinary, as a benefit to us 
 farmers to enable us to avoid them." I will merely 
 add that my hen lays one egg a day, and my cock 
 don't lay two, (too) and to enable the Dr. and others 
 similarly minded, if they wish to avoid them, that 
 , my fowls are of the variety of yellow Shanghaes.

 Gueuou on Milch Cows. 

Having seen a short aiticleinthe December number 
 of your valuable Journal, on Guenon's system of judg- 
 ing milk cows, and being a believer in the science, 
 looking for information from every source, upon that 
 subject, I thought the article alluded to would have 
 called out a short response from some of your numer- 
 ous readers, to throw some light upon it. As there 
 are many believers within your vicinity who profess 
 to understand the science, and practice upon it for 
 their own use, I hope they will be willing to give us 
 the benefit of their experience as to whether it is 
 true or false, according to their judgment. By so 
 doing they will much oblige

 Cultivation of the Cranberry. 

Mr. Editor: — Permit me, through the pages of 
 your Journal, to offer, a few remarks upon the culti- 
 vation of the cranberry. The culture of this fruit 
 has been much neglected in many of our States, and 
 no crop, in my opinion, will pay the cultivator, on 
 many soils, as well as the cranberry. One acre of 
 well-prepared land will produce from one hundred 
 and fifty to three hundred and fifty bushels of mar- 
 ketable fruit. The harvesting is done with an iron 
 rake, made for the purpose, and one man, with a 
 boy to gather up the scattering fruit, will gather from 
 twenty-five to forty bushels per day. 

The selection of soil suitable for their growth re- 
 quires some observation and practice to ensure com- 
 plete success. A clayey soil which contains moisture 
 and is not liable to bake ; a dark, deep loam with a 
 mixture of sand ; bogs or swamps which can be made 
 moderately dry, arj all well adapted to the growth 
 of the cranberry. In fact, I have seen, even in bogs 
 which during the greater part of the year are cover- 
 ed with water, the cranberry entirely in possession 
 of the soil, rooting out all other vegetation. In our 
 own county of Chester, there are now countless acres 
 of idle and worthless land that with but little expense 
 might be reclaimed and brought into condition for 
 the culture of this fruit. 

As far as I can speak from experience, there is 
 but one variety that naturalizes itself and succeeds 
 well on dry or upland soil ; this is the "Bell" which 
 is much larger than the "Barberry" or the "cherry," 
 and grows much in the form of an egg ; and in the 
 wild stale grows on the edges of the cranberry bogs, 
 inclining to spread its way to upland or dry soiL 
 Persons commencing the culture should begin with 
 those that have become naturalized to dry soil ; by 
 this means they will much sooner and with less ex- 
 pense get up a stock, as they increase very fast. 
 The soil, before planting, should be well prepared
