by which New York is supplied with milk by her 
 own "City Dairymon." The operations of these large 
 swill milk establishmonfcs, as detailed in this book 
 would be utterly incredible, if the f\icts were not too 
 well established to admit of a doubt in the matter. 
 We shall make s me extracts from this work in our 
 next number. 

The PRoaRKssiVE Farmer: A scientific treatise on 
 Agricultural Chemistry, the Geology of Agriculture; 
 on Plants, Animals, Manures, and soils. Applied 
 to practical agriculture by I. I. Nash, instructor of 
 Agriculture in Amherst College, &c., &c. C. M. Sax" 
 ton. New York. Price 50 cents. 

A most useful and excellent publication, and one 
 that we have no hesitation in recommending every 
 farmer to purchase and carefully read and study. Our 
 word ior it, he will close the volume a better farmer 
 than when he opened it.

WORK FOR THE MONTH. 

Farm. 

Sow clover seed on wheat fields, before the ground 
 gets settled, at the rate of 5 or 6 quarts to acre. Tim- 
 othy, Italian rye, green-grass, &c., may also now be 
 sown, if not done in the fall. Use none but clean 
 seed. Plough ground and nut in oats crop as soon 
 as the weather will admit, sowing not less than 2 to 3 
 bushels to acre. P iss a roller over after harrowing. 
 Roll also mowing and recent pasture ground. This 
 settles such roots as have been heaved up by winter. 
 Sow plaster, one bushel to acre, over all the grass 
 fields. This should be done this month, so as to 
 have the benefit of moisture in the soil, and spring 
 rains.* The ammonia in rain water by combination 
 with plaster, forms the non-volatile sulphate of am- 
 monia. The effects of plaster are not so observable 
 in a very dry season. Guano mixed with plaster may 
 also be sown with advantage as a top dressing to 
 grass lands, in a damp spell of weather, or just pre- 
 vious to rain ; but super-phosphate of lime for this 
 purpose is preferable. Haul out manure from barn- 
 yard for corn and potatoe crops, which are gross feed- 
 ers, and require it ; using for wheat crop in fall, gu- 
 ano and super phosphate of lime, th^is making more 
 corn and more loheat. Hire an extra hand or two for 
 a few weeks, to accomplish this in season. The fer- 
 mentation of the manure in the soil stimulates the 
 early growth, and affords food for the maturing of 
 the crop. 

Plough deeply and subsoil corn ground. Top-dress 
 winter grain which was not manured last fall. Plant 
 potatoes for early crop, as soon as ground will ad- 
 mit. Give particular attention to cows which have 
 calved, and ewes having lambed. Succulent food, 
 such as turnips, carrots, beets, increases the flow of 
 milk, and should always be given in addition to grain 
 and hay. Feed the mothers well, is the ti-ue plan to 
 make good lambs. Have a piece of early pasture 
 ground to turn them on. Give extra feeding to work- 
 ing cattle. At leisure times, clean out thoroughly 
 and whitewash poultry houses inside. Pick stones 
 off mowing fields. Open the mouths of drains. 
 Fruit Orchard. 

Attend to directions of last month, and perform 
 what was omitted. Planting of trees in this section 
 can be done during this month. See directions for 
 planting in present number of Farm Journal. Select 

the best varieties of fruit trees, and plant apples from 
 35 to 40 feet apart. Peach trees 20 ; also cherries, 
 pears and plums. Dwarf pears, 10 to 12. Grafting 
 may be done this month. Prepare grafting wax by 
 mixing three parts of bees wax, three parts of rosin, 
 and two of tallow. Plant out gooseberry and cur- 
 rant cuttings, first removing all the lower eyes. 
 Trench and prepare the ground thoroughly with short 
 manure. Grape vine cuttings should be planted with 
 two eyes out of the ground, and in a soil rather sandy 
 and moist. Trim grape vines at once, if not already 
 done, and dig in around roots well rotted manure. 
 Strip ofl' of all trees, cocoons and larvoe of insects, and 
 apply wash before recommended. Apply salt to 
 quince trees. Manure and clear up strawberry and 
 raspberry beds, and make new plantations of each. 
 Uncover such of the latter as were laid down last fall 
 for protection. 

Vegetable Garden. 

The operations of the garden for this month must 
 depend on the weather, and the condition of the 
 ground. Such seeds as are not easily injured by 
 frosts should be sown, such as peas, beets, parsnips, 
 lettuce, radish-seed, onion-seed and sets, early car- 
 rots, asparagus seeds for new beds; and plant out 
 two year old roots, cabbage-seed,&c. If the weather is 
 suitable, cabbage, lettuce and cauliflowers may be 
 planted out from frames. Uncover spinach, parsley, 
 lettuce, &c. Trench ground for horse-radish, and set 
 out pieces of old roots in rich soil. Dress up rhubarb, 
 and manure thoroughly if not already done. 
 Give close attention to'frames,&c., and cover on cold 
 nights. Give air on tine days. Tomato, pepper and 
 egg plants, which have grown thickly, should be 
 pricked out into other frames. Start Lima beans in 
 sods inverted, within doors, so as to be ready for 
 planting out for early crops, so soon as the weather is 
 settled. Set out beds of sage, sweet marjoram, winter 
 savory, pennyroyal and other perennial herbs, by di- 
 viding the roots of old plants. Plant sweet potatoes 
 in hot beds for sprouting, and cucumbers in frames 
 for forcing. 

As a general rule in gardening, make deep soil, 
 manure heavily, and use plenty of seed. Better to 
 thin out than to have to re-sow. 

Flower Garden. 

This is a busy month in the Flower Garden. Re- 
 move the covering from the roses, and all half hardy 
 things. Loosen the fastenings of junipers, Irish 
 yews, &c., by which they had been secured against 
 winter storms. Prune roses and flowering shrubs. 
 To prune roses, observe in the running varieties, to 
 cut out as much old wood as possible, leaving only 
 shoots of the previous summer's growth ; shorten 
 them one-third, and secure them firmly to the trellis 
 or stake. Daily roses treat as above, only shorten 
 their shoots two-thirds. The Hybrid perpetuals, and 
 hardy garden roses should be pruned back to three 
 or four eyes of the old wood. Roses will give more 
 satisfaction by being closely pruned, than ctherwiso. 
 In pruning shrubs, cut out any dead wood ; thin out 
 the branches where they crowd each otiier : shorten 
 any straggling branches ; by this means they will as- 
 sume a good shape. Secure honeysuckles, clemati- 
 sis and other running vines firmly to their trellises. 
 Manure liberally roses and flo^^ering shrubs. This 
 is a good time to plant all kinds of shrubbery and 
 evergreens, and all kinds of hardy biennials and pe- 
 rennials. All such as have grown too large should 
 be taken up, separated and replanted immediately. 
 Remove the covering of leaves or litter from the tulip 
 beds, or other articles which had been protected by
