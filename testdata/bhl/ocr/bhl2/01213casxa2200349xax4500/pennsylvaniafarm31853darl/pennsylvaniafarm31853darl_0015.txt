For the following interesting information relative to 
 the topography and agriculture of one of our north- 
 ern counties, we are indebted to Dr. A. L. Elwyn, 
 corresponding Secretary of our State Society. It is 
 contained in a letter addressed to him by John M. 
 Hamilton, Coudersport, in that county : 

CoL'DERSPORT, Jan. Gtli, 1S53. 

Dear Sir: — "To do away \.ith the impression" 
 you refer to is a task for which I may be unequal. 
 "Poor, rough and hilly" is a hard character for any 
 district of country. With such an impression abroad 
 ■which I know to bo too prevalent, it is not astonish- 
 ing that the advance of Potter county has been slow. 
 Tioga county and McKean county, the first on the 
 east and the latter on the west do not bear this rep- 
 utation, yet a brief comparison of progress may not 
 be amiss. All three, I think, were set oflf in the 

same year, 18'J5, by our Legislature. Our neighbors 
 possessed geographical advantages. The Tioga river 
 became the connecting link between the Susquehan- 
 na (West Branch) and New Y'ork ; settlements com- 
 menced, and in 1820 the county numbered 4021 of 
 population. McKean had the outlet of the Alleghe- 
 ny wiih her handsome valley and the "Ischunuang- 
 wandb" to which the settlement must have been 
 chiefly confined, judging from the population in 1820, 
 which was 728— perhaps a portion was on the "Drift- 
 wood" branch of the Sinnamahouing, in the South 
 East •corner of the county. Potter lay between, 
 without any important outlet, cut ofi' from the West 
 Branch by the timber and coal lands of Clinton, and 
 imayined to be so difficult of access, that they com- 
 plained, even in 1847, when I came to this place, 
 that persons passing from Eastern Tioga to Smeth- 
 port, would take Corning and Olean in their route. 
 Her population in 1810 was 10 f\vmilies ; in 1S20 
 they numbered 180. Until 1820 their judicial dis- 
 trict centered at William-port, 100 miles distant. 
 About that time the Court was removed to Snieth- 
 port, the county seat of McKean, and for ten years 
 all their legal business was transacted there. In 
 1830 the population of McKean wasonly 1439, while 
 that of Potter was 12G5 ; and in 1836, I think, the 
 first Court was held in this place. By the last cen- 
 sus, 1850, this county numljcred about 0,000,. bein^ 
 larger than McKean, and a rapid approach toward 
 Tioga. We have now a daily stage to the north ; a 
 semi-weekly mail to the northwest; one weekly to 
 the northeas', to the east, to the west; and thrio 
 weekly to the south ; a brick Court House nearly- 
 finished, estimated to cost about $15,009 ; the coun- 
 ty only about ?4,000 in debt for loans,, and in a pros- 
 perous condition. 

Now for the topography: Pass a line east and, 
 west through this place, which is aljout 1.5 miles 
 south of the State lino, and you divide the oountj. 
 into two portions, which are entirely different, at 
 least in reference to the shape of surface. The north 
 half comprises the head ■waters of the Gc;ujcs>ee,
