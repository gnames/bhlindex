 Send us good farmers. The unseated lands of 
 the county can be bought from S.3 to $5 per acre, 
 and in some parts of the county, for even less than 
 .?3. Farms with more or less of clearing and im- 
 provements may be purchased from ?10 to 1520 per 
 acre. There are no improved breeds of stock in the 
 county. I endeavored last spring to raise a club fur 
 the purchase of an Alderney bull, of your friend, 
 Aaron Clement, but failed. I hope to be more suc- 
 cessful since the organization of our Society. 
 Very respectfully vours,

Professor Mapes' Reply to G. Blight Browne. 

We copy the following editorial from the April 
 number of the Working Farmer, being a reply to a 
 criticism of our correspondent, G. Blight Browne, in 
 February number of Farm -Journal, upon an analy- 
 sis of soil, published in that paper. 

We give it with the view of letting the public see 
 both sides of the question, our only object being to 
 elicit truth, and subserve the great interests it is the 
 intent of both papers to promote. In discussions on 
 such matters of great importance to the farmer, we 
 see no advantage in using personal and offensive ep- 
 ithets. There is no argument, at least in them. AVe 
 omit here some expressions of this character, which 
 we think uncalled for. All analyses, professing to be 
 of a scientific character, are certainly open for criti- 
 cism and examination. 

"With the letter to which this uncourteous writer 
 refers before him, and with the following paragraph 
 contained in it, our readers can form some idea of 
 his sense of propriety. 

"'io« netd HOt allcmpi to add tJie whole required 
 quaniity to your soil in one, two or three years, but by 
 continuing the use of the amendments recommended, 
 with a reference to the relative proportions only, you 
 unit obtain full crops, and erentually place your soil in 
 a condition to he worked with very slight quantities of 
 farm or other manures." ' 

"Does G. Blight Browne not know that many soils 
 contain a much larger proportion of lime than that 
 we have recommended ? Dues he not know soils fer- 
 tile without manure, as given by Johnson, Norton, 
 and many other autliors, accord precisely with the 
 requirements stated by us in column No. 2? And 
 can he suppose that in the face of the paragraph we 
 have just (quoted, that wo could have intended to have 
 recommended these amendments to be added in the 
 quantities named? Would not any common-Kcnsenian 
 understand tliat we give this as showing the compo- 
 nents of a perfect soil, and advising the gradual ap- 
 proximation to such conditions as in the language of 
 our letter? "^ 

"We agree with Mr. Browne that .?5 is too small a 
 sum for an analysis of a soil, and lor this reason we 
 employ those who choose to work at that price, and 
 use our time in writing the accompanying Ijcttcrs nj 
 Aduice, for which we charge i?115 each." But Mr. 
 Browne seems not to be aware that many chemists are 
 now engaged in analyzing soils at ^o each. 

"As to the gentleman to whom he refers, Mr. Wil- 
 liam 11. Bradley, who was our pupil, and who lately 
 died at the Sa.xon School of Mines, in Germany, we 
 would refer him to the recent Germ.an Scientific Jour- 
 nals, to ascertain the reputation of Mr. Bradley, as 
 an Analytical Chemist. We think he might find it 
 at least equal to that of G. Blight Browne. 

"Dr. Charles Enderlin, whose European reputation 
 cannotbe unknown to Mr. Browne, if he reads chemical 
 works at all, has analyzed soils, (certainly sixty with- 
 in the last two months) for us, at §5 each, and with 
 a degree of care fully equal to any that could be be- 
 stowed by Mr. U. Blight Brown, and probably with 
 as just a conception of the state or condition in which 
 the lime might be, that he might find combined with 
 the soil. 

"Dr. Antisell, Dr. James R. Chilton and others have 
 analyzed for us at the same price. 

"We find it more profitable to employ the services 
 of others, and to confine ourselves to the writing of 
 Letters of Adcice founded on these analyses. 

"A chemist who has one soil per month to analyze, 
 certainly cannot perform it with any profit to himself 
 at $0 dollars ; and while we admit that the price is too 
 low, still we are well aware of the fact that the gen- 
 tlemen we have named carry on the analyses some- 
 times of a hundred soils at once, causing them to be 
 repeated by their pupils as tests of their exactness ; 
 and in a well systemized laboratory, where so large 
 an amount of business is done in the analyses of 
 soils, that it is not unprofitable. 

"Mr. G. B. B. says that some of the most fertile al- 
 luvial land in Ohio contains but a shade over one-half 
 of one per cent, of lime, but this lime is a carbonate. 
 Does he pretend to say that an alluvial soil filled with 
 organic as well as inorganic constituents re.adily 
 adaptable to the use of plants, is to Ijo taken as a 
 guide for soils like the one analyzed by Mr. Bradley? 
 If so, we should advise Mr. G. B. B. to review his 
 agricultural studies. 

Guauo and Dwarf Pears. 

The following information coming to us by a rath- 
 er indirect route, we copy from the Maine Farmer, 
 being an extract from a letter of one of its corres- 
 pondents : 

During a brief visit, last autumn, to an intelligent 
 cultivator, who resides in New -Jersey, on the banks 
 of the Delawaie, some 20 miles aliove Philadelphia, 
 and who grows fruit and vegetables for that market, 
 while conversing about his facilities for obtaining 
 manure, lie remarked that stable manure could be 
 had, landed on the bank of his farm, from sloops, at 
 $2 per cord, but thought guano, at !?iiO per ton, was 
 decidedly cheaper, besides being free from weed 
 seeds, and he used it almost exclusively. The soil 
 was what we should call a good light loam, although 
 it is Lhere termed a strong lo!im, in distinction from 
 the sandy lands of eastern New Jersey-. 

Among the many things which attracted attention 
 at this place, the one that interested me the most 
 was an orcliard of 1500 pear trees, on the quince 
 root. These were not all planted at the same time, 
 nor were they alike in other respects, for some 300 
 or 4lMI of tliem were grown in this country, and 
 grafted upon the common quince, probably the a.\>- 
 ple or pe.ar quince or seedlings from them. These 
 were dwarf sh enough, and though they had been 
 )ilantcd 7 years, had lnu-ne but little, and decidedly 
 realized the idea which used to prevail, that quince 
 rooted pears were necessarily poor, weakly and short
