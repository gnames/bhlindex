DAHLIAâ€” WHEN TO PRUNE. 

Dahlia. 

We present our 
 readers with an 
 enj^ravingol'a/)^)'- 
 fcct Dahlia. There 
 are Imt few varie- 
 ties that conform 
 1 entirely to this 
 [pattern; but the 
 1 s^reat increase of 
 ' new seo(llinj^s,and 
 the difficulty of 
 discrimination, 
 where they are 
 brought into com- 
 petition, at Ilorti- 
 cuKural Exhibi- 
 tions, makes it ne- 
 cessary to have a 
 jterfi'ct slaitdanJ. 
 There are varie- 
 ties whoso ou tllnes 
 are quite equal to 
 the above, and it 
 should be the aim 

of every cultivator to endeavor to approximate to it 
 as close as possible. The London Horticultural Mag- 
 azine, in describing a perfect Dahlia, says, "the flow- 
 er should be a perfect circle when viewed in front, 
 the petals should be broad at the ends, smooth at the 
 edges, perfectly free from indenture or point. They 
 should cup a little, but not enough to show the under 
 surface. They should be in regular rows, forming 
 an outline of a perfect circle, without any vacancy 
 between them, and all in the circle should be of the 
 same size, uniformly open to the same shape, and not 
 crumpled. The flower should form two-thirds of a 
 ball when looked at sideways. It should be inbricat- 
 ed, that is every petal covering the joints of the two 
 petals under it, which perfects the circular appear- 
 ance. 

The centre should bepcrfect,the umbloomed petals 
 laying with their points towards the centre should 
 form a button and be the highest p.irt of the flower, 
 completing the ball. 

The flower should be symmetrical. The petals 
 should open boldly, without showing their under side 
 even when half opened,and should form circular rows, 
 uniformly laid, and enlarging by degrees to the outer 
 row of all. 

The flower should be very double, and when well 
 grown, four inches in diameter and not more than 
 six. 

The color should be dense, and free from splashes 
 or blotches, or indefinite marks of any kind. 

If flowers are exhibited which show the disc, 
 or a green scale, or have been eaten by vermin, or 
 damaged by carriage, or partly decayed, the exami- 
 ners should reject them at once." 

The season for planting dahlias is at hand, and in 
 making purchases it will be well to select such as 
 approach the above standard. The description may 
 also be of use, in enabling committees at the diifor- 

ent HorticulUiral Exhibitions in the interior of our 
 State, and where the best varieties of this superb 
 flower are seldom seen, to decide understandingly, 
 where the competition is close. We have seen per- 
 sons standing in intense admiration over an old"strai- 
 ta Formossissima," and selecting it as a hner variety 
 than fifty superb sorts close by it. 

The Dahlia is an especial favorite of ours. Except 
 the Rose, it has no rival out of the Green House, for 
 brilliancy and varietj' of color, and splendor of gen- 
 eral efliect, when grown in large masses. They are 
 very easy of cultivation, bloom profusely, and con- 
 tinue four to five months, till hard frosts. When 
 grown singly also, in lawns or grass plots, and well 
 secured, the efl'ect by contrast with ether shrubbery 
 and by way of relief, is very fi .e. 

The Dalilia has lieen improved by skilful culture 
 in respect to height, as well as other respects. In- 
 deed,ihisshould be considered one point of excellence. 
 Formerly, they used to require small bean poles, six 
 or seven leet high; but many of the now ones have 
 dwarfed, not growing more than half that. Queen 
 of England, white and carmine, Miss Proctor,cream 
 tinged with pink, and Yellow Standard, in our col- 
 lection do not grow higher than three to three and a 
 half. This is quite a desideratum. 

We cultivate about eighty varieties. If asked to 
 name the best twelve, we should say the following, 
 in addition to the three above, and perhaps some of 
 our readers will give us others, for the next number 
 of the Farm Journal: 

Antagonist, white, Frincess Radzeville, white and 
 purple, Madame Tahler, buff tipped with bronze, 
 Roi des Points, crimson moroon, lilac tipped. Fame, 
 shaded plum. Star, white tipped with crimson, Ceci- 
 lia purple edged pure white, Jenny Lind rich, ruby 
 purple, tipped with white. Miss Blackmoorc, purple 
 tipped with white.

When to Prune. 

A correspondent has furnished us with the follow- 
 ing text : "At what times in the yeat should the dif- 
 ferent kinds of pruning lie perfoi-mcd, in the cold 
 latitudes of the north and the milder climates of the 
 south ?" 

We hold that pruning in general, in our northern 
 climates, is safest after the severe frosts of winter are 
 over, immediately before the swelling of the buds. 
 When performed early in the winter, or in the au- 
 tumn, as is practised properly in mild climates, tlie 
 ends of the cut shoots dry up," shrivel and die; losing 
 the buds intended to ma'ke leading shoots, and leav- 
 ing dead points that require much labor to prune ofl 
 afterwards ; or if large brandies ar ; cut off, leaving 
 a broad, fresh surface, the wood and bark dry up and 
 reipiire a long time to heal. We perform most of 
 our pruning in the montli of March, althcuigh a great 
 deal of the less exact nursery pruning is done in Feb- 
 ruary. Southward, as the winter is mild and spring 
 early, we should prefer pruning very early in the win- 
 ter or immediately after the fall of the leaf, because 
 udiciti/ in the functions of the tree coiumences early, 
 or scarcely ceases, as wo must bclievo it does during
