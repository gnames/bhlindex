WHEN TO TRUNE— GUANO AND LIME, &c.

our intensely cold weatber, und by pruning early we 
 economise the sap and strenj;tli of the tree. 

"Fnminr/ in the seanonwlu-ii. the leaves are on." The 
 only pruning we hold to be sound, safe and commend- 
 alil(!, at this season, is that of the fiaycr and thumb, 
 in^ oth'T words 2>i>"^^<iii{/- It is quite inconsistent 
 with good management to rear a crop of good shoots 
 and then cut them away. Tliis can only be avoided 
 by nipping superfluous and misplaced shoots at two 
 or three inches growth before they attain to woodi- 
 ness. This economises the force of the tree and turns 
 it into a channel where it will promote instead of 
 frustrating the ciids we are aiming at. For instance, 
 it_ we |il mt a young tree, and have pruned it with a 
 Mew to a certain form, and contrary to our expecta- 
 tions a shoot breaks out at an uhexpeeted point, and 
 assumes a vigorous habit and robs all other parts, 
 it would evidently be unwise to tolerate this intruder 
 until itarrives at full grinvth, and then cut ii away. 
 Too many trees are thus managed, by the neglect oi 
 summer pruning or pinching. AVe admit, however, 
 that there are eases in which the summer prunini', 
 or entire lopping off or cutting out branches of con- 
 siderable size, may be judicious and safe. For in- 
 stance in the case of neglected orchard trees, in a 
 luxuriant state, with dense heads in which the fruit 
 is deprived of air and light. lu such cases branches 
 may be thinned out anil the cut surface heals over 
 more rapidly and smoothly than at any other time. 
 But it is^ unsafe to produce any very sensible dimi- 
 nution of folia;je, as it arrests the growth of the tree. 

All pruning in the growing seas(m, tends to arrest 
 growth. Nurserymen know that a slight pruning of 
 stocks boiore budding, will so arrest growth as to 
 niake the bark adhere firmly ; when, before the pru- 
 ning, it lifted freely. It is only on this principle 
 that most all pruning, to promote fruitfulness, must 
 be done at a point of greater or less activity of growth. 
 Late spring pruning is often resorted to as a means 
 of subduing a superabundant vigor, and it has the 
 same effect as root pruning to a certain extent. —

Guano and Super PliosiUi.ite of liime. 

The usual practice of our Chester county farmers, 
 and, indeed, of eastern Pennsylvania, is to rely on 
 their barn yard manure for wheat and potato crops, 
 seldom using any elsewhere, except an occasional 
 top-dressing to pasture and mowing grounds.' The 
 last season a very consideralde amount of guano has 
 been u.^-^ed in this section, and so far as we can learn, 
 with very decided benefit and profit. Owing to the 
 usual reluctance of farmers to put their thoughts on 
 paper, we have been unable to obtain any accurate 
 and detailed experiments, but, without exception, so 
 far as we have heard, with No. 1, Peruvian guano, 
 the results have been very satisfactory. Applied to 
 the potato crop, spread in the furrows, and the po- 
 tato dropped on it, as well as when sowed broad- 
 cast, the yield has in many cases surpassed th.at of a 
 heavy coat of barn yard manure, in the adjoining 
 strip. For the wheat crop it has also answered well 
 where ploughed in previous to sowing. One farmer 
 occupying rather a hilly place, says the whole ex- 
 pense of the guano, 300 lbs. to the acre, was not more 
 than equ.al to the cost of labor, of merely hauling 
 and spreading the manure, and the grass afterwards 

better than whore the manure had been applied. For 
 the corn crop it has been found equally advantageous. 
 As a result of its use the past season, the demand 
 the present spring far exceeds that of last year, and 
 we fear also the supply will be short. At the time 
 we write it is scarce in Philadelphia, and commands 
 §50 per ton. 

The introduction of guano, and the admitted fact 
 of its great intrinsic value as a fertilizing agent, pro- 
 vided the supply is going to hold out, suggests a 
 change in our system which has heretofore been more 
 difHeult ; that of applying all the barn yard manure 
 to the corn crop, which is a gross feeder, and using 
 guano for the wheat. The increase of the corn crop 
 will more than pay for cost of guano, and we believe 
 there will be larger crops of both. As much of the 
 streiigth of the manure will remain after the corn 
 crop has had the benefit of it, and which is thus all 
 gain, as is usually left in the fall, by ordinary process 
 of exposure to the sun and rains for 5 or 6 summer 
 months. The effects of guano have also been more 
 permanent than was at first expected, and within our 
 knowledge the benefit has been observed for three 
 years after its application, and in one case four. 
 Soils considered heretofore second and third rate, 
 valued at SW to S50 per acre, by its use at the rate 
 of 300 lbs. to the acre, have been made to yield a 
 product equal to that of the very best. As regards 
 the superphosphate of lime, many inquiries have 
 been made of us as to its comparative value with gu- 
 ano, but experience, in this section, has as yet been 
 quite limited. Some few tons* were sold from the ag- 
 ricultural warehouse, in AVest Chester, last fall, but 
 chiefly for the wheat, which, so far, looks well. Our 
 farmers have been quite captivated with the high- 
 flown colors ot the advertisement in theAVorking Far- 
 mer, particularly where it speaks of an increase of a 
 ton of hay to the acre, from the use of 100 lbs., and 
 also 1100 bu.of roots to theacre,and are disposedto try 
 it the present spring, as a top-dressing for their pas- 
 ture and mowirg grounds. If these expectations are 
 realized, and especially if they are not, wo shall 
 have more to say about Professor Mapes' super-phos- 
 phate of lime. The condition of the ammonia, being 
 in the form of a sulphate, (non volatile) would seem 
 to indicate its preference over guano as a top-dress

French Merino Sheep. — "The peculiar charac- 
 teristics of the French Merinos are, that they combine 
 both mutton and wool qualities. AA'hethers of this 
 breed, at full age, dress from 30 to 35 pounds the 
 quarter, and they shear from 8 to 28 lbs. of beautiful 
 quality of washed wool. They are superior nurses, 
 and very prolific, and naturally tame and quiet, re- 
 quiring but little fence to control them." — Northern 
 Farmer.
