it is very common that the rougher points die, and 
 that the disease thus begun, extends to the entire 
 base of the cutting. In the ease of heavy wet soils, 
 it is better to take off cutting's before the commence- 
 ment of growth, and cover them with sand, till the 
 ground is in working order in the spring, and then 
 put them in the ground for growing. Such I believe 
 is the case with the greater part of hardy, deciduous, 
 woody plants that grow freely from cuttings. The 
 difference between growing cuttings, without roots, 
 and trees with roots, is much in favor of the latter, 
 but the healingof the wounds, made in taking up the 
 tree and separating tho cuttings, is almost equally 
 important in both, and the circumstances favorable 
 to one, we may fairly infer to be also favorable to the 
 other. If, therefore, what I have stated of cuttings 
 be true, as I believe is generally admitted, it would 
 follow that hardy trees will be planted in dry, light 
 soils with most success in the autumn, sufficiently 
 soon after the cessation of growth to heal the wounds 
 of the roots before the severe weather commences ; 
 and that in heavy, wet soils, the planting should be 
 deferred until the ground became in working order 
 in the spring, in every case cutting the broken and 
 wounded roots smoothly so that they may heal freely, 
 The ground should be in gojd working order at the 
 time of planting, and well pressed down, so as to 
 come in close contact with every part of the roots. 
 Now as to the mode of planting. It is frequently 
 recommended to dig a deep hole, filling up so much 
 with good gardjn soil as will leave sufficient 
 depth for planting the tree ; this, in light deep 
 soils, and porous, open subsoils may be right, 
 but in those places in which the subsoil is an 
 impervious, hard pan, or retentive clay, holding wa- 
 ter, it is obvious that the good soil in this pit must, 
 in the wet season, be entirely saturated with wa'er, 
 in which healthy growth can hardly take place, and 
 in the dry season it will promote vig.rous growth 
 only so long as till the roots shall have extended to 
 the sides of the hole, when, being below the soil they 
 must penetrate into the stiff, unyielding and barren 
 subsoil, or turn up at the edge of the hole, (as if 
 they were in a tub) until they reached the soil, so as 
 to escape from the pit, in either case the growth will 
 be affected injuriously. It is important, especially 
 for common fruit trees, that the roots pass freely 
 through the fertile soil, and that they should not be 
 placed below it ; and, therefore, it would be better in 
 those places where the subsoil is ycry retentive of 
 water, instead of digging a deep hole and bringing 
 good soil and putting in it to support the tree, that 
 the soil so brought be placed on the surface and the 
 tree planted in it, the roots then would exert their 
 natural tendency to grow outward and downward 
 without being obliged to enter the subsoil. 

It is common in many places to plant a field, or 
 more commonly a part of a field, with apple or pear 

trees as an orchard, and then to subject the field to 
 the usual rotation of crops, viz : Indian Qorn, oats 
 and wheat, one year each in succession, then gr.ass 
 two years for mowing and one or two years for pas- 
 turage. This couise has two great disadvantages; 
 one of them is, that the cattle during tho time of 
 pasturage destroy many trees ; and the other is, that 
 during the seasons that the land is plowed yearly, 
 the tree roots are not allowed to rise into the plowed 
 ground, but are kept immediately below the run of 
 the plough ; but the ground being kept loo.se and 
 open by culture, they receive the rain and moisture 
 freely, and during the first half of the corn season, 
 and the latter part of the oats and wheat years, with- 
 out much competition from any growing crop. But 
 then follows three or four seasons of grass, during 
 which time the ground is not ploughed, and the 
 whole surface covered with grass, and the trees hav- 
 ing to compete with the grass in obtaining nourish- 
 ment, it becomes necessary that the small roots make 
 their way upward toward the surface in order to 
 obtain a portion of the rain and dew sufficient to 
 support their growth, and toward the close of the 
 grass seasons the tree is mainly supported by roots 
 drawing their sustenance from very near the surface 
 â€” in tho very best soil. But now conies the sad re- 
 verse. A deep ploughing takes place for Indian corn, 
 and these roots are now cut away, and for three years 
 the tree has to seek its support through a smaller 
 number of roots, and which have for years been al- 
 most inactive. Although young and healthy trees 
 may support a few changes of this kind, yet they 
 cannot be so long lived or so protracted and vigorous 
 as they would be without these periodical and' vio- 
 lent changes. Ploughing annually with sufficient 
 manuring, or not ploughing at all would either of 
 tliem be better for an orchard. A good method of rais- 
 ing an orchard is, first: Enclose the quantity of 
 ground wanted, with a good fence ; after one year's 
 cultivation with corn or potatoes, plant the trees ; 
 keep the ground in cultivation for several, say ten 
 years, with Indian corn, potatoes, pumpkins and 
 crops of that kind that require cultivation during 
 their growth, giving sufficient manure to keep, the 
 land fertile, and never piUting rye or wheat in it. 
 As the roots and tops of the trees extend, do not 
 plough or put in crops close to them, so that neither 
 the roots or tops may bo touched by the plough or 
 the team. At the end of the term of ten years, or 
 perhaps earlier, the culture may be discontinued, 
 and the ground used only for the production of fruit. 
 No horses, except for ploughing it, nor cattle or 
 swine should be permitted within the enclosurq till 
 the trees are nearly grown ; after which time hogs 
 may be let in during the time that unripe or wormy 
 fruit is dropping. In this case trees may be planted 
 closer than when it is intended to continue cropping. 
 I think 25 feet would be sufficient, and the trees
