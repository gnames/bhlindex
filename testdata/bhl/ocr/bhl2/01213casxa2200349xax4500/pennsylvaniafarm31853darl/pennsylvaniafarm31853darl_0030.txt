 sandy and gravelly on the upland, clayoy in the in- 
 tervales ; there ia little waste land ; timber, white

It is divided into about twenty farms, mostly rang- 
 ing from 100 to 150 acres; llicse are subdivided in- 
 to 9 or 10 enclosures, (principally by "worm fence," 
 some, hedges of the Virginia thorn, craicegits cordata, 
 but these are now being abandoned,) exclusive of 
 woqdlands and permanent meadows. 

The rotation of crops almost universally pursued 
 is : First year, corn on an old sod ; 2nd, oats ; 3rd, 
 wheat ; 4th, clover and timothy, mown or pastured ; 
 5th hay, 0th hay ; 7th, 8th, 9th, pasture. 

The division of land, average products of crops 
 and prices may be seen in the table annexed, the 
 estimates of grain crops and prices are taken from 
 actual memorandum, for the last ten years, on alarm 
 of medium capacity. Prices embrace the low rates 
 caused by commercial depre^sionf, 10 years since, 
 and the high ones consequent upon the e^tportations' 
 of 1847. Wheat crops, embrace two good crops, av- 
 eraging 27 and 28 bushels, and two poor <ines of 9 
 and 11 bu.^hcls, occasioned by winter-killing, Hes- 
 sian fly and rust. Corn crops ranged from 20 bu., 
 owing to the excessive drought of 1844, to 80 bu. 
 Other items are from personal, obsgrvatibn, and of 
 course are only an approximafion to the actual re- 
 sults, tho' I believe they are nearly correct. 

Sufiicient potatoes are intended to be rai;sed to sup- 
 ply each family ; the risk of disease prevents auy- 
 tliing further. They arc generally planted in part of 
 the oats field. Sweet potatoes and citron ■ melons 
 thrive and produce; well, but are not much cultivated. 
 Much attention is paid to raising a variety of garden 
 vegetables for home use in their season ; and some 
 to the smaller fri^its, currants, gooseberries, raspber- 
 ries, &o., but not a' great deal given to pears, plums, 
 cherries, peaches or grape? ; buckwheat none ; rye, 
 little or none ; roots for stock, turnips, Swedish or 
 common, beets, carrots, &c., but little grown. 

Durham stock of AVhitaker's importations, has 
 been introduced, and there are pure bred arid gnide 
 animals of that and other crosses. Also, Southdown 
 sheep, bred from Joseph Cope's importations ; and 
 the stallion Dilligence, bred from an iinported Nor- 
 man horse. Hogs, Berkshires receive no favor. The 
 "Chester county" is universal. The follovring are 
 the weights of several killed the past {all,, at about 
 16 months old: 525, 518, 482, 424 lbs., although the 
 average would be about 300 lbs. 

Within half a century, and for one hundred years 
 previously — for this district has been a strictly agri- 
 cultural one since the days of Penn — and before the 
 present alternation of crops, accompanied by sowing 
 of artificial grains, and the application of lime and 

plaster, tlie uplands, (after clearing off the timber) 
 were cropped with grain as long as the crop was 
 thought to pay for the labor, and then being consid- 
 ered us "team oui" and of little value, was either 
 made common or added to the range of stock, which 
 could barely pick a subsistence. All the hay for 
 winter provender was gathered from natural or wat- 
 erad meadow b mks. These werj esteemed the far- 
 mer's sole dependence. Now, those waste uplands 
 constitute some oj our most productive lands, and 
 continue increasing in fertility. 

Amount consumed" does not include grain fed to 
 daily cows or feeding stock, intended'for market. 

Number of horses, oxen and cows does not em- 
 brace young stock under four years of age.

 White Blackberry. 

There has been a considerable stir lately among 
 tho horticulturists about a species of the- nibtis villo- 
 sus, called the white blackberry. It is said to be 
 very fine. Whether it is or not it really must be a 
 curiosity among the tribe of dark berries. Can any 
 reatlers, of the Journal give a history of it, and where 
 it can be obtained ; as such information would be 
 very acceptable to a subscriber. J. C. B.
