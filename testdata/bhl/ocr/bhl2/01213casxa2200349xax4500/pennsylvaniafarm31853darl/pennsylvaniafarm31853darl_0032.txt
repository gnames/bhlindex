 The Wheat Fly, Again. 
 The following passages are extracted from a recent 
 Letter from Dr. T. AV. Harris, the author of the 
 valuable work on the Insects injurious to vegetation, 
 dated Camhridge, Mass., Feb. 12, 1853, to Dr. Wni. 
 Darlington, of West Chester. Information from such 
 high authority will, no doubt, be duly appreciated 
 by our Agricultural friends. 

"If you have ever looked over the Transactions of 
 the Linntean Society of London, you may remember 
 to have seen the accounts, by Mr. Marsham and 
 Mr. Kirby, of an insect injurious to the wheat crops 
 in England, half a century ago. This insect was 
 called Tipula Tritici, and is now referred to the ge- 
 nus Cecidomi/ia, and its common nauT! is the wheat- 
 fly. Twenty-five or more years ago, it reached this 
 country; was first observed in the Brilish Provinces; 
 was found in the northern part of Vermont, on the 
 borders of Lower Canada in 1828, and has gradually 
 spread through New England and New York, and 
 Beems to be working its way southward and west. 
 ward every year. The amount of damage done by 
 it varies greatly in different years and places; and 
 in some instances, it has nearly disappeared from 
 places where it formerly prevailed. In its winged 
 state, the insect is a minute fly or stingless gnat, 
 much smaller than the Ilessiau fly, with orange-color- 
 ed body and legs, transparent wings, and long bead- 
 like antenna:. The time of the appearance of these 
 flies varies, according to temperature and situation, 
 from the beginning of June to the end of August; 
 but the principal swarms appear in the wheat-fields 
 in New England from the middle of June to the 
 middle of July, at which time the flies lay their eggs 
 within the chaffy scales of the grain. The eggs 
 hatch in about eight days, and produce minute or. 
 ange-colored maggots, which live on the pollen and 
 on the soft substance of the grain while in the milk, 
 extracting it from the base of the germ. In conse- 
 quence of this depredation, the grains do not till out 
 plump, and are always more or less shriveled and de- 
 fective. The maggots come to their full size in a- 
 bout fourteen days, when they cease feeding, and re- 
 main torpid for a few days, during which they cast 
 their skins, which are delicate transparent films. 
 After this, the greater part of the swarms, if the 
 weather be sufficiently moist, descend to the ground 
 and burrow under the surface, where they remain in 
 a dormant state till spring, when they take the chrys- 
 alis form in the earth, and emerge from their retreats 
 as flies in June and July. Late broods of the mag- 
 gots are sometimes harvested with the grain and car- 
 ried into the barn, where they will be found in the 
 chaff and in the screenings of the grain. This is 
 very likely to happen if the maggots have not come 
 to their full growth, or if their descent to the earth 
 has been retarded by dry weather. This seems to 

have been the case with the specimens you have sent 
 to me. The insects are in their dormant state: some 
 have shed their skins; others have merely shaken 
 themselves loose from their skins, without throwing 
 them off." 

"A detailed account of the history of this insect 
 will be found in my Treatise on insects injurious to ' 
 vegetation, a new edition of which has been recent- 
 ly printed; but the foregoing brief abstract embraces 
 all the essential particulars. No remedies have been 
 fully successful in arresting the ravages of this in- 
 sect. It is highly important that the chaff, dust, \ 
 and refuse straw, if found to contain the maggots, 
 sliould be immediately burnt, so as to destroy the 
 dormant maggots and prevent their change to flies. 
 Crops have been saved from injury by sowing in the 
 early part of the Autumn or late in the Spring. 
 Spring-wheat has done better than winter-wheat, 
 especially if sown (in New England) after the 15th 
 or 20th of May. Other remedies have been tried? 
 and of these see my book above named, f ^ 

"I have satisfied myself, on historical grounds^ 
 that all the species of Cueurbita are originally Amer' 
 ican. They were unknown in Europe before the dis- 
 covery of the western continent. The two or three 
 species, referred by botanists to India, are proved to j 
 be exotics there. They came from this Western In- ' 
 dia. Even Cucurbita ovifcra turns out not to be a i 
 native of Astrachau. Lerche found it there only as a ' 
 cultivated plant in the gardens, in company with In- • 
 dian corn and Brazilian beans, all undoubtedly in- 
 troduced directly or indirectly from America." 

t In a subsequent letter, referring to this subject, 
 Dr. II. says: —"I may not have sufficiently urged the 
 importance of destroying the larvae or maggots of 
 the wheat-insect left in tlie chafl'. It may be found 
 expedient to reap the wheat early, or before the mag- 
 gots have left the ears. The insects will then remain 
 in the chaff, and dust after the grain is threshed and 
 winnowed, with which they should be burnt. In • 
 this way a large proportion of the next year's swarm 
 of flies will be destroyed. If this be neglected, and 
 the maggots are left to descend from the grain in the 
 field, or are scattered with the chaff and dust around ,| 
 the barn-yard, the ground will be well seeded for a ' 
 plentiful crop of the insects in the following year." <

 Gueuon on Milch Cows. 

Since the publication of the last Journal, there 
 has been several sales of cows within eight or ten 
 miles of West Chester, and as your readers abroad 
 may want to know what a good cow is worth here, 
 (having the "Milk Mirror" perfect,) we will add the 
 prices of two. One sold in Thornbury, Delaware 
 county, brought SOO 50; another sold near Paoli, 
 in Chester county, brought ?0-t 25. The above cows 
 were well known aud tried; the first one making ten 
 or eleven pounds of butter a week all through the
