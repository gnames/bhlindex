As the time is drawing near for planting Corn, I 
 consider it very important that Farmers should be 
 acquainted with the best mode of preparing seed 
 corn for planting. The mode I 'have practised for 
 several years, with great success, is, immediately be- 
 fore depositing the seed in the ground, to mix two 
 quarts of soft soap with half a bushel of seed corn; 
 after that is done, put a good supply of Plaster with 
 the above, and mix well together. Plant the corn 
 with as little delay as possible afterwards.

The Strawberry Q,uestion~Hovey's Seedling. 

The following communication was read at the late 
 meeting of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society: 
 To THE Pennsylvania Horticultural Society: 

In accordance with a suggestion of the society, 
 expressed in one of its regulations, that "notices of 
 peculiarities in culture, management, &c., of the ob- 
 je;ts are most desirable," I make a few remarks on 
 the sexual characters of the plants of Hovey's Straw- 
 berry, I have exhibited this evening. 

This variety is usually classed as a pistillate, and 
 considered worthless when not planted in the neigh- 
 borhood of a etuminate kind. I find by repeated ob- 
 servations, made while forcing them, that they be- 
 come a staminate by being forced slowly, in a made- 
 rate temperature; at the same time an abundance of 
 light, and a regular supply of moisture — conditions 
 well known as essential to a healthy luxuriousness 
 of the strawberry. On the other hand, I find that 
 whatever tends to check that luxuriance has a ten- 
 dency to produce the pistillate form. In the speci- 
 mens before you, one very weak from over watering 
 and deficient drainage, is a pistillate ; another, a 
 very weak plant and forced rapidly, has the anthers, 
 very nearly abortive ; while the other plant which 
 has been in the forcing house since the middle of 
 January, and in circumstances every way favorable 
 to their healthy development, are as perfect as possi- 
 ble. 

Last season a number of plants, started in a tem- 
 perature of 05 deg., and ripened in one of 75 to 80 
 deg., produced all pistillates. Twelve rnnnera from 
 these plants were selected, potted in small pots, and 
 ultimately treated as other plants for forcing. Seven 
 of the strongest of these produced stuminate flowers 
 and the other five pistillate, like their parent plants. 
 Another set of 100 pots, last season, produced all 
 pistillates. A similar set, forced easily this season, 
 produced all but the weakest plants, perfect. It haa 
 been doubted 'whether the Alice MaUde, in many 
 collections, is correctly so, and it has been suggested 
 that the growers should observe whether their plants 
 are pistillates or staminates, in order to decide. I 
 have submitted the above observations to you, hop- 
 ing they may have a practical bearing on that ques- 
 tion by showing the distinction between pistillates 
 and staminates to be worthless— cultivation produc- 
 ing either the one or the other.

The Metropolitan ExLibition. 

At the Metropolitan Exhibition, which closed a 
 short time since at Washington, D. C, we notice that 
 Chester county came in for a share of the honors. 
 The Messrs. Pennock, of Kennett Square, received 
 the first premium for their new Slide Grain Drill. 
 Three other Drills were exhibited — Hunt's, Gatchell's 
 and Urmy's. Messrs. Lee, Pierce & Lee, of this 
 county, whose Drill is in deservedly high repute 
 wherever known, were not represented at this Exhi- 
 bition. 

NEW CORN PiLANTEK. 

The above cut repifesents a new and improved Corn 
 Planter, recently patented by S. & M. Pennock, of 
 Kennett Square, in this county. Remarkably sim- 
 ple in its construction — having neither Cog-wheel, 
 nor fixing of any kind, that can possibly get out of 
 order — this Drill must soon work its way into favor 
 with farmers. It is so constructed as to drop four to 
 sis grains to the hill, three feet apart, or one to three 
 grains' eigliteen inches apart; covers them the proper 
 depth and presses down the earth with a roller. A 
 set of steel teeth accompany the Drill, when desired, 
 so that by removing the planting arrangement, it 
 may be converted into a Cultivator. This Drill, we
