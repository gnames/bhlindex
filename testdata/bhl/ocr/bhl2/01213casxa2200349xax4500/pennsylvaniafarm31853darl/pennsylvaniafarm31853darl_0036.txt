GEORGE RENICK— TREE PLANTERS AND NURSERYMEN. 

ApML, 

Watts, "he saw nothing superior to them in all 
 Great Britain,'' when he was examining their stock 
 as agent of tlie tliird and last company, formed in 
 1852. In some respects, as I understand from him, 
 the pure descendants of the tirst and second impor- 
 tations, are ahead of any thing he saw on the Em- 
 pire Island. In every effort to improve our cattle, 
 Mr. Kenick has taken a leading part. There is an 
 old adage, "Let honor be rendered to whom honor is 
 due." Ic would give rae unfeigned pleasure to see 
 this rule applied justly and fully to him. I think it 
 would have a wholesome, an encouraging effect upon 
 the rising agricultural generation. There is no so- 
 ciety, State or National, which would nut do honor 
 to itself by passing the highest encomiums, or offer- 
 ing the highest rewards, for actions and services 
 Winch have been of such general and unrestricted 
 good. The experiment can never be repeated, but 
 tae effect is lor all time. IIis peaceful and quiet 
 home needs no music from the trumpet of fame to 
 make it more happy; but il that class which he re- 
 presents, wishes to attain and maintain the first po- 
 sition in society, let them acknowledge and appreci- 
 ate his good example. If I shall have caused, by 
 this communication, the young sons of the soil to 
 esteem and value the character of the modest and 
 amiable old South Branch Patriarch, Oeouge Hexick, 
 of Ross county, Ohio, I shall be amply compensated.

Tree Planters and Jfurserymeu. 

There is one point about nursery trees, that gives 
 rise occasionally to considerable discussion between 
 the buyers and sellers, and it has occurred to us that 
 it miglit be well to offer a few remarks on it at this 
 time. We allude to the dissatisfaction and disap- 
 pointment that purchasers experience on receiving 
 from the nursery trees of a somewhat crooked or ir- 
 regular growth, or of smaller size than they had ex- 
 pected. We are very well aware that it is not a little 
 aggravating to receive trees of four feet in height in- 
 stead of six or eight, as expected; or to get them 
 with stems curved and twisted in half a dozen differ- 
 ent ways, instead of being as straight as a gun bar- 
 rel. To theainatenr who intends to make but a small 
 plantation, and desires every tree to be a model, this 
 IS particularly provoking; and in his trouble, unless 
 he be as patient as Job, he reproaches the poor nur- 
 seryman mostseverely. Now weare not aboutto plead 
 the case of the nurserymen; they must take care of 
 themselves. They are, we know very well, often 
 much to blame, and deserve reproach; but they are 

dcr the same culture, in three years, than a Red Can- 
 ada or Neioton Pippin in five; and at any size, their 
 stout shoots, straight trunk, and smooth, clean bark, 
 are pleasing to the eye; while the slender, twiggy, 
 rough-barked trees, are just the reverse. These con- 
 siderations should bo taken into account. The nur- 
 seryman is paid no more for the slow growers than 
 he is for the rapid growers, and it is not reasonable 
 to expect them so large or so vigorous looking. Then 
 there are varieties, such as the li. I. Greening and 
 Fedl Pippin, of irregular growth, with very seldom 
 a straight stem, that it is quite unreasonable to ex- 
 pect as symmetrical as a Baldwin or a Northern 
 Spy. 

If we turn to pears, we find these remarks equally 
 applicable If Mr. A. will order from his nursery- 
 man the Barilett, SeckeU,Buff'am, Deiichese d' Angoit- 
 leme, Marie Louise, and Winter Nelis, he will find a 
 marked, and perhaps to him a very disagreeable con- 
 trast in their size and form. The Bvffum and Duchess 
 may be eight feet high, thrifty, and smooth as young 
 willows; the Bartlett not over five feet, and the Seckel 
 four; while the Marie Louise and Winter Nelis will 
 not only be small, but twisted into the most fantastic 
 and untreedike shapes. Looking at the Buff'um and 
 the Duchcfs, he will at once say, "Now these are 
 what I call trees — just what I wanted; but these," 
 turning to poor Marie Louise and Winter Nelis,"t,hese 
 are horrible." The nurseryman, who perhaps search- 
 ed up and down every row in his nursery to get the 
 straightest and best ones to please Mr. A., who is ve- 
 ry nice, is sure to get not less than two pages of a 
 scold; and not only that, he must lose a part of his 
 bill and ever after the trade of one whom he hoped 
 would be a good customer. 

Turn again to cherries, and we find the same sour- 
 ces of disappointment. Mr. A. wants half a dozen 
 cherry trees — tall, handsome, well-shaped trees, of 
 uniform size and shape; as he intends them for orna- 
 ment as well as fruit. Well, he orders Black Tarta- 
 rian, Yellow Spanish, Napoleon Bigarreau,Matj Duke, 
 Belle de Choi.-:!/, and Belle Magnif que— a.\l first-rate 
 cherries; but unfortunately, when they are received, 
 the Belle de C/ioisy and Magnifique are mere dwarfs 
 beside the majestic Black Tartarians and Napoleons. 
 He then regrets he ordered them, and blames the 
 nurseryman for not knowing better than to send 
 them. 

So with plums. No one need expect to get Green 
 Gages and Jeffcrsons of uniform size with Imperial 
 Gages, Smith's Orleans, or Magnum Bonums. If they 
 do, they will generally be disappointed. 

Those who regard the size and shape of their trees 
 as of the.^ra^ importance, must not be very tenacious 

not unfrequently censured without good reason; and \ about varieties; and, on the c;jntrary,those who place 

if those who purchase trees would study beforehand qV'My first, must be loss difficult to please as to size 

- ■ ■ • - Morm. The reasons are obvious. I here are cer- 

the o'laracters of the varieties selected, as to growth, 
 they would not so often be disappointed. 

Now we will suppose, for instance, that Mr. A. or- 
 ders from his nurseryman a dozen apple tree?, as 
 follows: — Early Joe, Summer Pose, American Sum- 
 mer P<armain, Fall Pippin, Gravenstein, Porter, Bald- 
 win, Fantcnse, Northern Spy, Newtown Pij^pia, Melon, 
 and lied Canada; aud that these trees are to be, we 
 will say, three years old from the bud or graft. We 
 would find that the Gravenstein, Baldwin, Full Pip- 
 ]iin, Fameu.se, and Northern Spy, which are strong, 
 rapid growers; are large, thrifty, beautiful trees; 
 while tlie others, which are remarkably slow growers, 
 are not more than hall as large,and will be pronoun- 
 ced small, scrubby, stut. ted things, not tit to be seen, 
 much less planted. A Baldwin, Grarenstein, or 

anil 1-- 

tain requisites, however, which purchasers have _ a 
 right to demand from the nurseryman under all cir- 
 cumstances. These are— 1st, That trees be sound 
 and thrifty, stout in proportion to their height, and 
 supplied with an abundance of healthy, unmutilated 
 roots. 2d, That the varieties be genuine. 3d, That 
 they be packed and prepared for transportation with 
 the greatest possible care and skill. The purchaser 
 who fixes his mind upon mere size, forgetful of these, 
 stands in his own light; andwill, if he lives long 
 enough, find out his mistake. 

Would it not be well for nurserymen to indicate, 
 or arrange in separate classes, slow growers and those 
 of a very irregular or crooked growth ? 

We throw out these hints for the purpose of draw- 

Northera Spy, will be larger in the same soil and un- ing attention to a matter that, as long as we can
