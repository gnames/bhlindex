Improvement of Poultry.

While most other interests involved in the circle 
 of domestic economy, have, for a few years past, 
 been consulted and improved, the subject of poultry 
 has, until lately, been wholly neglected. The thought 
 that fowls of a larger size, liner forms, more beauti- 
 ful plumage, and of better habits and character 
 could be cultivated, seems not to have entered the 
 mind of the farmer. The familiarity of this interest, 
 together with its universality, has wholly clouded 
 the idea of its importance. Every poor man, able to 
 hire a room sufficient to shelter himself, his wife and 
 his stove, has kept his half dozen fowls. And the 
 able farmer with his five scores, has hardly once 
 thought of the beauty and utility of uniform color, 
 larger size and better character. 

That there has been room for great improvement 
 in the native fowls of this country, and that the in- 
 troduction of foreign breeds has already accomplish- 
 ed much improvement is not to be disputed. But 
 it cannot be conceded that everything that is foreign, 
 is from that cause alone, superior and excellent. I 
 see not why a breed of fowls, as large as a turkey, 
 should be less expensive to keep than the turkey, or 
 should be more profitable, or in every respect prefer- 
 able to the turkey. Why then should breeds of an 
 enormous size be sought after? 

The English Dorking, either white, or rich buflf, or 
 fawn color, well shaped, hardy, domestic, and weigh- 
 ing, at twelve months old, four to six pounds dress- 
 ed, is a desirable fowl. But in some respects the 
 Chinese varieties are an improvement upon this 
 breed. The Shanghai and Cochin China, which are 
 the best of these varieties, are generally rather lar- 
 ger than the Dorking, and more plump and beauti- 
 ful in form. If not more costly to keep, and equal- 
 ly hardy and prolific, they would be the preferable 
 fowl. So far as my experience extends, (and I have 
 kept both kinds during summer and winter,) I have 
 imagined no difference in the productiveness of ei- 
 ther, or in the expense of sustaining them. Although 
 I would not relinquish the culture of the Dorking, 
 still I esteem the Chinese bird, all things considered, 
 the "ne plus ultra" of domestic fowls. 

A cross of the select Dorking hen, with the Shang- 
 hai or Cochin China cock, produces a most excellent 
 fowl. The China, being a tropical bird, does not 
 fledge as speedily, nor reach maturity as soon as the 
 Dorking, which is a native of a higher latitude. 
 This cross, therefore, while it somewhat increases 
 the size of the Dorking, and improves its form, ex- 
 pedites also the maturity of the Shanghai. A bird 
 of this cross will be full fledged in about h.alf the 
 time of a full blood China. But the pure China is 
 still the more beautiful bird. 

There is altogether an erroneous impression exten- 
 sively entertained, in regard to the necessity of feath- 
 ered legs, to the purity of the blood of the Chinese 
 fowl. The fact of feathered legs, in the varieties of 
 both Cochin China and Shanghai, has nothing to do 
 with the purity of the blood of either. In their na- 
 tive country they are both clean limbed and feath- 
 ered, and bear the same name, as I am assured by a 
 gentleman who has cultivated both, and imported 
 them, for his own private use and gratification. 
 Feathered limbs, as a curious and singular feature 
 >f the bird, may perhaps please for a short time. 

And to the man of fancy, whose "henery" is swept 
 and garnished, may do well enough. But to the ev- 
 ery day man, whose fowls have access to the barn 
 yard, the cow pen and the linor of the porkers, these 
 feathered appendages must be any thing else than 
 desirable, in muddy, wet and freezing weather. Like 
 the honey bee, their legs would soon be heavily load- 
 ed, but with a freight of rather a different character. 
 The freer from feathers on the legs, therefore, the 
 more desirable would they be for the farmer's use. 
 The leading shades of color of the Cochin China, 
 saem to be buff, orange or yellow. Of the Shang- 
 hais, the same, and also a brownish yellow, fringed 
 with black, often very beautiful — while the cocks of 
 both varieties carry extremely rich, high colors. The 
 Dorking, the Cochin China and the Shanghai, not- 
 withstanding the ridicule to which the latter have 
 been at times subjected, are probably as near the 
 standard of excellence, for all the purposes for which 
 they are designed, as we can reasonably expect or 
 desire — Wool Grower. 

Mexican Wild Potatoes. 

Prof. MAPES^Dear Sir: — The article in the Dec. 
 No. of the Farmer, in reference to a new kind of 
 Potatoe introduced into France from Mexico, reminds 
 me of an intention which I have for some time had, 
 lo describe, for the benefit of your readers, a new 
 potato which has been raised by Mr. A. Hale, of 
 Alloway, in this county, for four years. The pota- 
 toes were brought from Mexico by a returned sol- 
 dier, and had been planted one year in this country. 
 Mr. Hale procured four potatoes, which were about 
 the size and length of a man's thumb — skin thin, 
 white, eyes shallow, and flesh very white. These 
 were carefully divided and planted, and produced as 
 follows : 

year. seed planted. product. 

1849. 4 potatoes. i bushel. 

18,50. J bushel. 29 •' 

1851. 24 " 350 " 

They were offered in market last spring, and sold 
 readily at all prices — some at ?10 per bushel, and 
 some at 25 cents each. Being thus disseminated, we 
 can better judge of what they will produce in gene- 
 ral cultivation, and I have asked many farmers in 
 reference to the yield. All have been planted, so 
 far as I have learned, without manure, except one 
 lot, and most of them on sandy loam. The products 
 are as follows: 

Messrs. Rovs & Sciioonover raised 100 bu. from 2 bu. 
 Mr. Hofman " 57 " " 1} " 

Mr. Brayden " 30 " " i " 

Joseph Fellers " 13 " " \ " 

The smallest yield was 18 " " 1 " 

Mr. Hale informs me that they have increased in 
 size every year, and many are now six inches long, 
 and some which I saw at the State Fair at Utica I 
 should think were seven inches, for which the owner 
 refused 121 cents each. 

They have been dug early and late, kept in cellars 
 and in banks, and sbcjw no disposition to rot. When 
 cooked they are pearly white, mealy, and in season 
 whenever mature. Their form fits them particularly 
 for baking ; and when properly baked they hhve no 
 rival that 1 have ever eaten. Steaming is the best 
 method of cooking. When boiled, care must be ta- 
 I ken not to overcook them. The first time my hired 
 girl cooked them, I cautioned her not to overboil 
 j them. She seemed a little riled, and replied, "In- 
 dade. will ye be after teaching a paddy how to cook 
 praties ? When they came on the table they were
