MEXICAN WILD POTATOES— AGRICULTURE— WILLOW, &c. 

April, 

cooked, potatoes water and all, into very good mitsh. 
 But a very little care will prevent this; and then you 
 have a luxury in a potato. Should they prove in 
 other localities to be as free from rot, as productive 
 and as delicious as they have done in this region, 
 they will iorm a very valuable addition to the potato 
 crop. 

While most other crops in the U. S. have increas- 
 ed since the census of 1840, the potato crop has di- 
 minished. This is owing to the rot. In I84U the 
 product was 108,298,000 bushels; in 1850, 104,055,- 
 989 ; of these, 38,259,195 were sweet. If a variety 
 can be found which will not rot, this amount will be 
 doubled in the ne.xt ten years, and we shall then 
 raise 200,000,000 bushels— only one-third the crop 
 in importance in the United States. 

The variety introduced into France from Me.xico 
 was yellow inside, while this is white. This may 
 arise from the, two kinds having been procured from 
 ditferent localities, for the following extract from the 
 report of the Hon. Mr. Kennedy, Superintendent of 
 the Census, shows that they grow wild in many 
 places: — "It has been found in an indigenous state in 
 Chili, on the mountains near Valparaiso and Men- 
 dosa; also near Montevidio, Lima, Quito, as well as 
 Santa Fe de Bogota, a,nd more recently in Mexico, on 
 the flanks of Orizaba." — Working Farmer.

Agriculture in Califuruia, 

On the 7th of last October, a large agricultural fair 
 ■was held at Sacramenta, which was quite an aflViir. 
 An address was on that occasion delivered by Dr. 
 John F. Morse, in which he made thefollowing state- 
 ments relative to farms of difterent gentlemen. He 
 said that, on the garden of Mr. Bennett, numbering 
 30 acres, were raised GO bushels of grain per acre. 
 Ho employs 10 men, and realizes §595 weekly. The 
 garden of Messrs. Smith & Barber, numbering 30 
 acres yields S^GO a day. 

Mr. Southwick, on bis farm, keeps 125 cows, at a 
 cost of $G00 per month. He sells 17G gallons of milk 
 daily, at §1 per gallon. He realizes SG3. 000 annual- 
 ly from his dairy alone. Gen. Hutchinson, on 80 
 acres, realizes 50 bushels of wheat per acre, which 
 weighed 52 pounds to the bushel, and was worth 
 $91,584. 

William II. Davis, on a farm of COO acres, keeps 
 2,000 head of stock. J. M. Horn, of San Rose Val- 
 ley, has a farm of 200 acres, which produces 80 
 bushels of bailey to the acre; also, 150 acres of po- 
 tatoes, producing 300 bushels per acre. They are 
 worth ipl per bushel; besides large crops of wheat 
 and oats. 

Mr. E. S. Beard, of the same Valley, has 540 acres 
 in barley, wheat and oats, yielding on an average, 
 50 bushels per acre. Also, 260 acres of potatoes, 
 yielding 250 bushels per acre. Aggregate amount 
 n value, §260,000. 

At a late meeting of the Farmers' Club in this 
 city CS. Y.,) Mr. Shelton, of California, stated that 
 Indian corn did not generally flourish in California. 
 It grew to an enormous height with small crops, 
 from 20 to 25 feet high, at least. The climate is ex- 
 ceedingly changeable. Mr. S. said that he saivsome 
 Canada corn four to six feet high, the ears being 
 near the ground. The westerly winds rush in at 
 San Francisco, and rarify the hot air in the valley 
 where stands the city. The branches of trees are all 
 bent to the eastward. Various trees are so injured 
 by wind and sand that they become stunted and 
 grow up in a bush form. As soon as the rainy sea- 

son begins, clover commences to grow and grows ver- 
 ry bushy and tender. The Indian squaws gather 
 baskets full, every day, making a kind of beverage 
 of it. The hills and valleys are covered with wild 
 oats and clover. The cattle and stock get very fat 
 oh these oats and clover. The clover comprises some 
 fifteen or twenty varieties of every hue and color. 
 The grasses are very tine; the native timothy yields 
 from two to five tons per acre. It is ten feet high. 
 The pin grass is of a very curiouR growth. An acid 
 clover grows very abundant in the valleys; the na- 
 tives made a lemonade of it; it is very healthy. He 
 gathered one bushel of sour clover weighing 3 lbs. 

The Rev. Mr. Filch, of California, stated that vege- 
 tation began in November, and dried up in June. 
 Drought continues till November, and gonerallj' with- 
 out dew. The people commence cutting barley a- 
 bout the last of May, and let it lay on the ground 
 over two months, not raked up. — Scientific American. 

Osier Willow. 

The Osier Willow is getting to be extensively used 
 in this country for baskets, cradles, children's wag- 
 on bodies, and other purposes. We believe it is most- 
 ly imported from Europe; it grows finely, however, 
 in this country, and we see no reason why it should 
 not be cultivated sufficiently to supply the home de- 
 mand. It is grown at Colton's nursery. New York. 
 At a late meeting of the New York Farmer's Club, 
 wc learn by the New York Tribune, that the follow- 
 ing remarks on the culture and commercial value of 
 this article were made by George Dickey. 

The Osier Willow for basket making — price in 
 New York from 3.i- to 8 cents per pound, is imported 
 from France and Germany, but chiefly from France. 
 England grows all she uses. There is a considera- 
 ble quantity grown on Staten Island, near Richmond, 
 which brings about five cents per pound on the aver- 
 age when prepared for use. It is planted in small 
 sized twigs by the acre, in damp soil, leaving some 
 pathways between, and it is necessary to keep the 
 ground clean and clear of the growing of weeds and 
 other plants. It will grow in soil unfit for other 
 purposes; it will not grow well on light or sandy soil. 
 The bark is taken off by a triangular instrument 
 which catches the twigs that are drawn through it, 
 the prongs of the instrument being made round and 
 arranged to press hard on the twigs as they are pull- 
 ed through the machinery, the prongs of which are 
 made of iron. 

A Receipt for the Blind Staggers in Hogs. — A 
 correspondent of the Michigan Farmer, directs, as a 
 remedy for this disease, to bleed them in the third 
 wrinkle in the roof of the mouth. My practice is to 
 throw the hog on the back and cut across the wrin- 
 kles, and I have never had a case that did not effect 
 a cure. J. B. 

Girdled Trees — A correspondent of the Genessee 
 Farmer says that girdled trees may be preserved by 
 the following: Take out a block of wood extending 
 above and below the girdle, and take from the body 
 or limb of another tree a block corresponding in 
 size and shape, with the bark on, and adjust it in 
 the place, and bind it there, on the prin .'iple of en- 
 grafting. This plan, it is said, has proved suooees- 
 ful.
