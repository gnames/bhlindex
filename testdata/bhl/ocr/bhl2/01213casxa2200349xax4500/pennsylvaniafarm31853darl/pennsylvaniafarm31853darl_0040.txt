amount of food produce the greatest profit. They are have been replaced here by the Chester county. We 
 equally worthy the attention of the scientific breed- ' know of ndne of this stripe left in these diggings, 
 er and manager. As an evidence of what has been and had to send to our friend Solon Robinson, to 
 attained already, we subjoin by way of comparison, procure us a portrait of some of those about New 
 a portrait of the old unimproved breed of hogs,-whioh York. 

WORK FOR THE MONTH. 

Farm. — Read over directions of last month, and at- 
 tend to what was omitted. Sow oats as soon as the 
 ground is in order; harrow thoroughly and then roll. 
 Pass roller over mowing fields. 

Top-dress winter grain not previously manured, 
 with short manure or Guano and Plaster. 

Plough for corn, and subsoil before ground be- 
 comes too dry. Much of the success of the crop, 
 depends on good ploughingand preparation of ground. 
 Avoid such ploughs, as turn up and leave a smooth, 
 glazed and unbroken furrow. The sun often hard- 
 ens such, into lumps, impervious to harrow. Fine 
 pulverization of soil is of great importance. We 
 have found Prouty's& Rogers' ploughs, to plough and 
 pulverise at the same time; open seams and cracks in 
 the furrow, which admit air, and greatly aid the 
 subsequent operation of the harrow. Spread nanure 
 or Guano previous to ploughing. No advantage in 
 planting corn in this section before second week in 
 next month, but the ground should be often stirred 
 previously. Plant Potatoes for early crop. Plough 
 and prepare for root crops. Also for sowing corn 
 for fodder; read article on this in last volume of Jour- 
 nal, page 325. 

Give particular attention to stock. After being 
 well cared for all winter, they often fall off in last 
 month before pasture. Ewes and Lambs should 
 have allowance of grain and roots and good hay, 
 daily turned out in fine weather, on a pasture lot 
 reserved for the purpose. Continue or increase al- 
 lowance of meal and roots to Fresh Cows. It is an 
 old saying that stock well wintered, are half sum- 
 mered. They should go out to grass in good order. 
 There is never any profit in keeping stock helow the 
 thriving peint. To merely keep them alive will not 

Do not turn out stock to grass too early. Feed 
 well all working cattle, both oxen and horses. Cut 
 hay is of great advantage, as it economises time, and 
 gives animals more time to rest, between working 

hours. • It takes them less time to eat and is easier 
 digested. 

Give all animals daily access to salt. 
 Fruit Orchard. — Planting trees may still be done 
 this month, and in doing so, cut off all bruised and 
 broken roots ; make the cut from the lower part, so 
 that the cut surface may be down. 

Head in by cutting off the ends of branches of 
 large trees. 

See to peach trees that the worm is not at work. 
 If the earth was removed from the body of the trees 
 last fall, put a shovel-full or two of wood-ashes around 
 each tree, and return the earth that was taken away. 
 Quince trees should be dug around and well manured; 
 we have found that salt scattered under them answers 
 an excellent purpose in producing fair fruit. Goose- 
 berrieSjCurrants and grape vines 2 year old,from cut- 
 tings should not be transplanted in places; in digging 
 the holes, make them large and deep, filling in what 
 was before occupied with subsoil, with surface loam, 
 lea\ingtlie subsoil on the top to become improved 
 by the contact of sun and air. These should be hea- 
 vily manured, as the gooseberry and currant are 
 rank feeders. All transplanted trees should be mulch- 
 ed by putting around the roots, manure hay or straw. 
 Grafting of apple and pear may still be continued, if 
 the grafts were cut in season and properly taken care 
 of till the leaves begin to expand. Cherries, plums 
 and peaches should have been done last month. Re- 
 move all insects from trees, and apply wash before 
 recommended, and remember that trees need culti- 
 vation. 

Vecietable Garden. — This is an important month 
 in the garden. Finish planting out esculents for 
 seed, and at a distance from others of the same genus. 
 All kinds of seed may usually be planted this mouth, 
 reserving such .as are tender of frost till the last. 
 Make plantations of asparagus. Plant out rhubarb, 
 horse-radish and onion-setts ; also seed for nest year's 
 pips. Sow peas, radishes, lettuce, every few days 
 for a succession. Plant out cabbages, cauliflower
