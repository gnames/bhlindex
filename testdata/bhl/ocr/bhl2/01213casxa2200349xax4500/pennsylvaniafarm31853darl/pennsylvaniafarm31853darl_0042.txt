On motion of James Cameron, of Northumber-

 Committee appointed this morning to prepare busi- 
 ness, which was so ordered, and the following Re- 
 port was read by F. M. AVatts, of Cumberland: 

REPORT. 

The plan which the Committee offer to the Con- 
 vention is, they think, simple, practicable and in- 
 expensive, and perfectly well adapted to carry out 
 the design they have in view, and fulfil every hope 
 of the most sanguine friend of agriculture. 

The3' do not propose the founding of a university, 
 or any system of education which would require a 
 long preliminary preparation on the part of the pu- 
 pil, and rich endowments from the State or individ- 
 uals. They design only a school where instruction 
 can be had in the usual branches of what is called 
 an English education, and in the elements of the 
 different sciences •which are immediately and inti- 

mately connected with agriculture. At present, in 
 no part of this State or of the United States, can a 
 farmer's sou be taught anything but the rudimentary 
 branches of education. Of all those sciences and 
 arts which form the very basis of his future occupa- 
 tion, he is either entirely ignorant, or is only a)jle to 
 collect a few isolated facts, of whose general bearing, 
 and whose appropriate position in tlie philosophy of 
 agriculture, be knows very little, or nothing at all. 

This condition of things acts as unfavorably on 
 the individual as upon agriculture. No man is dis- 
 posed to believe that he is practising a profession of 
 much importance, when he is conscious of no very 
 considerable effort of the mind to acquire it, and 
 finds thaf his facts, all his knowledge, and the whole 
 action of his mind, as respects his art, are rather the 
 superstitious observance of old customs, which came 
 to him as the traditionary experience of his an- 
 cestors, than the result of his own observation or 
 thought. But the doctrine of precedents, however 
 safe, is too unyielding to continue as a constant and 
 fixed rule, to which no exception can be taken, and 
 from which there is no departure, under any circum- 
 stances. 

There is a spirit of examination abroad in the 
 world, from whose scrutiny nothing escapes; and ag- 
 riculture, which, till within a few years, was regard- 
 ed as a kind of tranquil retirement for dull minds, 
 has passed to the crucible of the chemist, the closet 
 of the philosopher, under the close and deep exami- 
 nation of the man of science, and entered among the 
 profound speculations of the political economist. 
 The destiny of this noble art is now entirely remov- 
 ed from mere manual dexteritj' or the pursuit of old 
 customs. Powerful and acute minds are busy with 
 it, minutely examining its practical details, in all its 
 departments, endeavoring to break down the obsti- 
 nancy of old ideas, by analysis of their truth, and 
 form principles and philosophy from what has here- 
 tofore been but a crude mass of ill arranged and im- 
 perfectly examined assertions. It is now a progres- 
 sive art, and rapidly assuming the form and condi- 
 tion of a science. Conscious of this, those who have 
 the interests of agriculture deeply at heart, have de- 
 termined to propose to their fellow citizens, and the 
 farmers of the State, a plan, by which they cannot 
 only keep pace with the general movement, but pre- 
 vent themselves from fallinij; behind other States, 
 which are already commencing the establishment of 
 Schools and Professorships of Agriculture. 

Title — "The Farmers' High School of Pennsyl- 
 vania." 

Situation. — An important object, next to healthi- 
 ness, in the selection of a site for this school, is va- 
 riety of soil and of surface. It will be necessary for 
 the pupils to be taught, if it be possible, all the dif- 
 ferent modes of husbandry capable of being per- 
 formed in our climate. The soil should admit of the 
 cultivation of all the grains, the grazing of cattle, 
 and the raising of all the products of the dairy; so 
 I hat every pupil may have full experience, and a 
 complete preparation for the practising any one of 
 these modes of fiirming. The place chosen should 
 be near a market, or of such easy access as to allow 
 of ready sales; though we would not recommend the 
 immediate neighborhood of a large town, that there 
 might be no risk or temptation to the moral conduct 
 of the boys. Pennsylvania offers many such situa- 
 tions, and there can he but little difiBculty in a selec- 
 tion. 

Quantity of Land. — This will be controlled so 
 much by the site fixed upon, that we cannot well de-
