termine the precise quantity; we are of opinion, how- 
 ever, that not less than two, or, if possible, three 
 hundred acres, should be purchased, as one of the 
 desirable objects in the education of the boys will be 
 the knowledge of machinery, as well as some skill 
 in its construction. 

Educational Organization. — As the leading abject 
 of the school is instruction in agriculture, the head 
 should be a practical farmer; a man competent to 
 teach the best modes of husbandry, to instruct in 
 their details and possessing such an amount of me- 
 chanical skill or knowledge of machines as will en- 
 able him to describe the uses, together with the de- 
 sign and value, of the various agricultural imple- 
 ments and machinery. He should likewise be I'a- 
 miliar with the raising and fattening of stock-cattle, 
 and tlie growing of wool; have a knowledge of the 
 different breeds of animals; or, to sum up his quali- 
 fications, he must be a good farmer, capable, }>y his 
 character and example, of moulding the pupils en- 
 trusted to his care to such habits of mind and of 
 persevering industry as will send forth into the Com- 
 monwealth active, able and accomplished farmers. 

Assinlants. — Besides tlie Principal, whose duties 
 have just been given, we propose three assistants ; 
 one to teach the usual branches of an English edu- 
 cation ; another to instruct in natural philosophy ; 
 and the third in Chemistry, Geology and Botany. 
 It is no part of our plan to calljfor men of the highest 
 qualifications in anj' one of these departments ; as 
 it will not be possibilo to pay the large salaries such 
 persons might very justly expect, and to which (hey 
 would be justly entitled, even if the minds of those 
 pupils whom we hope to see gathering to this school 
 were fitted to receive any thing beyond elementary 
 instruction. There are, Iiowever, many young men 
 in the country fully competent to take charge of such 
 a seminary, and to advance the pupils as fitr as their 
 age and probable continuance at the school will ad- 
 mit. Besides the studies already mentioned, which 
 are such as are taught iu the schools and academies 
 of the land, there are others, belonging to agricul- 
 ture, which are of the utmost importance to the prac- 
 tical farmer, such as several departments of Natural 
 History, Surveying, and Veterinary Surgery and 
 Medicine. These, if the school becomes a place of 
 resort for the sons of our farmers, each of whom is 
 to manage and work his own property, must be made, 
 at some time, a necessary part of the plan of study. 

Pupils. — None should be admitted younger than 
 fourteen or fifteen. Whether an examination should 
 be required is a matter meriting some consideration, 
 though it does not seem to bo absolutely necessary ; 
 as a boy will soon display his incompetence to re- 
 ceive the prescribed studies, without the formality 
 of an examination. The times for admission m.ay 
 be twice in a year, selecting the periods when the 
 season for labor in the field commences, and when it 
 closes. _ All the pupils will be required to work, as 
 the business of their lives is supposed to be practical 
 husba-ndry ; of which they must learn and become 
 proficient in the most minute details. No one, under 
 any circumstances, should be allowed to escape from 
 labor, of whatever kind it may be, or to select a par- 
 ticular portion ; and there should be no evasion of 
 these rules, unless in cases of physical inability. 
 The object being to impart a practical as well as a 
 scientific education, every pupil must be taught those 
 details of personal labor which will form a large part 
 of the future duties of his life. A certain number 
 of hours in each day— the committee think that 
 three, at least, will be necessary — must, therefore, be 
 devoted to this purpose. 

To combine practice with theory, to Ic.arn the rea- 
 sons of things, and to acquire, bj' experience, the 
 whole routine of a farmers life, are the great purpo- 
 ses in the establishment of this school. We would 
 also propose that a certain number of pupils be edu- 
 cated gratuitously: one might be admitted fi-om each 
 Congressional district. 

Bnildinr/s. — In an experiment, such as is now pro- 
 posed, the smallest possible outlay should be kept in 
 view as one of the most important considerations. 
 In founding an Institution, the success of which de- 
 pends on legislative or individual encouragement, 
 the great object should be permanent practical use- 
 fulness ; and in order to attain this and recommend 
 the plan to the farmers of the State, we reject, in all 
 cases, every idea of mere ornament. It is not ne- 
 cessary to erect any other buildings than those usu- 
 al on a fiirm, enlarged to such an extent as to accom- 
 modate the increased number of persons. A single 
 building, containing apartments for the instructors, 
 sleeping rooms for the pupils, recitation rooois, a 
 library, lecture-room and laboratory, arranged to 
 hold with comfort one hundred persons, is, perhaps, 
 all that is necessary as a commencement. A barn 
 suited to the size of the farm, with every conveni- 
 ence for the feeding of cattle, the care of horses and 
 cows, the storage of roots, and the preservation of 
 manure, with a granery, corn-crib, implement house, 
 a shed for waggons and carts, with a carriage-hou.se 
 attached — these, with the exception of a spring 
 house as a part of the dairy, and some small build- 
 ings for poultry, seem all that is necessary at the 
 opening of our design. 

Now, inasmuch as the views of your committee 
 are based upon the idea that in Pennsylvania we are, 
 about to enter upon an untried project, the first dic- 
 tates of prudence suggest that we should proceed 
 cautiously so far as regards our first expenditure ; 
 that the institution which we propose should r.ather 
 grow than be suddenly forced into practical useful- 
 ness ; that its operations may be the result of expe- 
 rience, rather than the suggestion of mere theoreti- 
 cal calculation. We think that the first outlay should 
 be: 

For 200 acres of land, - - - ?9,000 00 
 Necessary buildings and improvements, 8,000 GO 
 Stock of the farm and furniture, 3,000 00 

.?20,000 00 
 The question now presents itself, how is this mo- 
 ney to be raised, and how is the institution to be sus 
 tained? First, we propose that it shall receive legis. 
 lative sanction, by an act of incorporation, and that 
 the amount of money which it wilt be necessary' to 
 expend, and provide for the maintenance and support 
 of the institution shall form the capital, to be divi- 
 ded into fonr thousand shares, of twenty-five dollars 
 each, making one hundred thousand dollars; an 
 amount which, if the project l)e successful, as we an- 
 ticipate, may, at some future day, be necessary. 

To raise this amount for the early requirements of 
 the Institution, we must rely upon the United efforts 
 of individuals and the represent.ative.s of the whole ' 
 people. We are satisfied that individuals will con- 
 tribute at least ten thousand dollars. Tlie Pennsyl- 
 vania State Agricultural Society will contribute five 
 thousand dollars ; and if the State will contribute I 
 ten thousand doll.ars, we shall tlius be in possession 
 of the means of commencing a scho(d, which we have 
 every reason to believe will grow intosizeand exten- 
 sive usefulness. Let it not be supposed that the 
 views of your Committee are too limited with regard 
 to the character of such an institution. We are well
