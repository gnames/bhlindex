ApRIt 

aware that a more enlarged plan would be more 
 commensurate with the character of the great State 
 of Pennsylvania ; and if the Legislature m its wis- 
 dom should deem it expedient and politic to enlarge 
 it, we shall look upon such action as being a most 
 happy expression of the public will. Our view is to 
 let this pnyect have a beginning, and we have all 
 confidence that, under the genial influence of enlight- 
 ened minds, it will work itself into public favor. 

Your Committtee, therefore, offer for the conside- 
 ration of the Convention the following : 

Resolved, That be a Committee whose 

duty it shall be to draft a bill in accordance with the 
 principles of this report, and submit the same for the 
 action of the Legislature. 

The subject matter of the report was eloquently 
 discussed by F. M. Watts, of Cumberland; John C. 
 Cresson, Philadelphia: Benjamin Ilerr, Lancaster; 
 David Mumma, jr., Dauphin ; Wm. M. Meredith, 
 Philadelphia; G. Blight Brown, Montgomery ; Jas. 
 C'ameron, Northumberland. 

On motion of A. S. Roberts, of Philadelphia, that 
 the blank in the resolution be filled with the name 
 of Frederick Watts, of Cumberland ; Simon Came- 
 ron, Dauphin; Christian Myers, Clarion: II. Jones 
 Brook, of Delaware, and the President of the Con- 
 vention, which was so ordered, and the question re- 
 curring on the resolution as amended, it was unani- 
 mously adopted. 

A vote of thanks to the Senate for their kindness 
 in tendering the use of the Hall, and to the presiding 
 officers of the Convention was passed, and the Con- 
 vention, on motion, adjourned.

AD INTERIM REPORT. 
 The Fruit Committee respectfully report, That 
 since the last stated meeting of the Society, they 
 have received and examined specimens of the follow- 
 ing varieties of fruits. 

From Charles Kesslor- JV/c Reading — This valu- 
 able winter pear has been noticed in several of our 
 ad interim reports. The present specimens which 
 were eaten on the 11th inst., have strengthened the 
 favorable opinion previously expressed by us, of its 
 merits. 

The Keim — which we have previously described, 
 appears to be a late keeping winter apple, assuming 
 a more beautiful waxen appearance with the ad\ance 
 of the season. 

Erening parly — This is the third time this delicious 
 little apple has been submitted to our examination, 
 during the present season. Each successive trial has 
 served to confirm our estimate of its value. 

The Orange — A medium sized native apple, from 
 the garden of Nicholas Lot, of Reading. The origi- 
 nal tree which stood on the adjoining premises is 
 now dead. The fruit is roundish, slightly oblate, 
 faintly ribbed, of a warm, yellow color, approaching 
 orange; stem short, thick; cavity open, shallo.v, ob- 
 tuse, irregular; basin shallow, wide, plaited. Flesh 
 yellowish, with a slight orange tint ; flavor sprightly; 
 quality "good." 

Tiie Ohlinger'—A native apple of Pennsylvania. 
 It originated with Mr. Ohlingcr in Alsace Township, 
 Berks county. It fruited in 1S.V2, for the first tit.'^ 
 Fruit below medium size ; roundish; waxen yellow> 
 with a pale, brownish cheek, containing many white^ 
 spots, with usually a russet speck in each; stem J 
 of an inch long, slender ; cavity deep, wide, russet- 
 ted in rays; basin wide, shallow, furrowed; seed 
 brown, sliort, round ovate ; flesh yellowish white, fine 
 texture; sprightly flavor ; quality "good." 

T.'ie Dumpling — A large, roundish, oval, yellow 
 apple; stem short; cavity contracted, shallow; ba- 
 sin narrow, rather deep.' This is entirely distinct 
 from the Dumpling of Coxc, and is a good deal cul- 
 tivated in some parts of Pennsylvania for culinary 
 purposes.
