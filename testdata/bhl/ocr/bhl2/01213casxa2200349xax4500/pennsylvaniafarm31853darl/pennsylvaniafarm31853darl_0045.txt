I claim the method of heckling hemp by subject- 
 ing it to the action of a series of mixed be.aters and 
 combs, the teeth of the latter being of varying length 
 —some of them projecting so far, and others beyond 
 the beaters, and the whole operating substantially as 
 set forth. 

Also a rest, having a narrow slot open at one end 
 in combination with a concave projecting beyond 
 the end of the cylinder at the open end of the rest, as

 Wilson, of Ilrtsting.s, N. Y. : We claim lifting the 
 saws at or sufficiently near the middle of the stroke, 
 to eflfect the specified purpose. 

Also interposing India rubber or its equivalent, be- 
 tween the ways, and the inclined projections which 
 lift the saw frame, as specified. 

Grain Washeiis. — ByGeorge &, George W. Fcaga, 
 of Frederick, Md. : We claim the method, as descri- 
 bed, of separating grain from smut, garlic and other 
 impurieties by first washing it in a trough or reser-

 then conveying the washed grain to a drying appara-

 We claim the manner of arranging the mould board 
 upon the land side, to wit, placing their binges at 
 such a distance from each other on each side of the 
 centre of the land side, that each mould board may 
 be supported by the edges and projection, as far as 
 practicable, fmm the hinges and rest upon the

 forth. 

Potato Diggers. — By F. C. Schaffor, of Brooklyn, 
 N. Y. : 1 am aware that machines have been previ- 
 ously used for digging potatoes, but in these machines 
 the potatoes are dug or scooped from the hills by 
 means of a concave or scoop formed of a single piece, 
 the brush cylinder carrying the potatoes up the con- 
 cave and into the receptacle. I therefore do not 
 claim the above arrangement ; but I claim the •ar- 
 rangement and combination of the scoop and endless 
 apron, by which the pot.atocs ar^ lug or scooped from 
 the hills, and the dirt thoroughly separated there- 
 from, as they pass up the endless apron into the re- 
 ceptacle.

 which it is held into the wood, and on which the 
 board or veneer, being sawed, may rest and relieve
