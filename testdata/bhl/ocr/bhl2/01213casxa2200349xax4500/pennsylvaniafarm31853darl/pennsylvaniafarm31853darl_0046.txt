 such a position, in relation to the deflector, that it 
 will, when the grain strikes the deflector, be thrown 
 ai^ainst the said plane surface, which, from its pecu- 
 liar position, will throw the grain in a partially 
 spread state, up against the adjustable top, which 
 causes it to spread still more, and then to fall down 
 on the ribbed bottom, and pass off through the wind

 justable to different heights, as described.

 no olaini to a spring valve, in itself, as such a contri- 
 vance is well known for various purposes. 

I also claim the 8elf-regulat!ng valve, which pre- 
 vents the admission of air into the machine, while it 
 opens, to discharge the impurities separated from the

Hermetically Sealed Provisions. 

The business of putting up provisions in hermeti- 
 cally sealed cans, has become quite an important one 
 in our city. Ihere are five large establishments engag- 
 ed in it. Beef, mutton, lamb, lobsters, clams, meats 
 and sheep's tongues, with green corn, green peas, 
 green beans in their season, &a.. Sec. are put up in 
 immense quantities. But a small portion of the ar- 
 ticles put up are used in the city — much the greater 
 quantity being sent to New York and Boston, where 
 they are sold to vessels bound to California, and on 
 other long voyages, and likewise for home consump- 
 tion. V/hen taken from the cans, they are generally 
 in excellent order, and retain much of their original 
 flavor, although months and even years may have 
 elapsed since they were sealed up — Portland (Me.)
