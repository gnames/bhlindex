Points of Cattle. 

In our last number, we referred to a valuable forth- 
 coming report, on the points of cattle, by a commit- 
 tee of the New York, State Society, headed by Francis 
 Rotch as Chairman. lu connection with some ex- 
 cellent prefatory remarks by him below, we quote a 
 scale of Points, as reported for four breeds, Durham^ 
 Devon, Hereford, and Ayrshire. They deserve the 
 especial attention of persons called upon to decide 
 at agricultural exhibition.s, between rival animals 
 often closely balaneed, and may safely be referred to 
 as a future standard. If attended to as they de- 
 serve, we sh.all have no more awards at our annu- 
 al exhibitions calculated to disgust intelligent Breed- 
 ers, and render the fact of having obtained a premi- 
 um often a mere burlesque. We hope the commit- 
 tee will not stop their work till they have arranged 
 a scale of points for sheep. 

"As to the points coiisiiiuthig excellence, little per- 
 haps need be said, beyond the remark, that reference 
 has been had to the particular uses and characteris- 
 tics of the respective variety under consideration. — 
 For instance, the heavy, massive form of the beel- 
 making, indolent Short-horn, would be, in many of 
 its details, inapplicable to the activity of the Norih 
 Devon, whose great excellence as a laliorer on a light 
 soil, must be one of its leading considerations in the 
 estimate of its usefulness. So again, of the Here- 
 ford, whose double value in the yoke and in the sham- 
 bles, requires a balance of properties, that is not 
 called for in the animal whoso only destination is 
 the butcher's block. The Ayrshire is a breed who.se 
 improvement has had reference solely to dairy prop- 
 erties ; it would be destructive, therefore of that very 
 improvement, to require in this, either the substance 
 or symmetry of the other breeds. 

"Another consideration h.as also influenced the 
 numerical value affixed to ihesanic points in dijfcrent 
 breeds ; which is, that where from a natural or orig- 
 inal tendency, there is a deficiency or a difBcnlty in 
 bringing any one or more points up to a maximum, 
 they are marked higher in that breed, than in one 
 known to be naturally strong in that particular ; for 
 instance, it is more difficult from the general confor- 
 mation of the animal, the heavy shoulder, and the 
 massiveness throughout, required in the Short-horn, 
 to breed the crops full up and even, than it is to do 
 so in a North Devon ; hence, that point well de- 
 veloped in the Short-horn is marked 4: in the North 
 Devon only 3. So in the Ayrshire, wliose great ex- 
 cellence is her dairy properties, the udder is marked 
 6, while in the other varieties of improved breeds it 
 is marked low, inasmuch as their improvement has 
 had reference solely to early maturity, weight, sym- 
 metry, reduced offal, quality, and the best feeding 
 properties, yielding the greatest amount of meat at 
 the smallest expense." 

SIIORT-IIORNS— THE COW. 

Pedigree — showing unbroken descent; or> both 
 sides, from known animals, as found in the English 
 Herd-Book— 40. 

The Head — small, lean and bony, taperiiig to the 
 muzzle; the face somewhat long — 2. 

The Nose of a light delicate color — lu 

The Eye is of great significance, and should be- 
 prominent, bright and clear — "prominent" from an 
 accumulation of "adeps" in the back part of its 
 socket, which indicates a tendency to Itty on fat —
