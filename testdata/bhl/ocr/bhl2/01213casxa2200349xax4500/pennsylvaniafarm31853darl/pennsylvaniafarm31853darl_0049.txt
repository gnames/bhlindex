POINTS OF CATTLE.

well back of the elbows, thus affording, by the aid of 
 a springing rib, abundant internal room for the ac- 
 tion of the thoracic viscera, the heart and lungs, and 
 that too withont an extreme width forward, and be- 
 tween the points of the shoulders, which might in- 
 terfere with the action of the animal. — 8. 

The Brisket — it being assummed that it adds 
 nothing to the internal capacity of ihe chest, must 
 not overload the breast, but be sufficiently developed 
 to guarantee a feeding property, attended with a full 
 proportion of fatty secretion — 2. 

The Shoulder is, in this breed, a very beautiful 
 and important point, and should in a dei/i-ee approx- 
 imate in form to that of the horse. It should take a 
 more sloping position than is found in most other 
 breeds, with its points less projecting, and angular, 
 and the blade bone more curved, thus blending with, 
 and forming a tine wither, rising a little above the 
 level line of the back — 3. 

The Crops full and even, forming a true line mt^ 
 the somewhat rising shoulder, and level back, with" 
 out either drop or hollow — 2. 

Back, Loin, and Hips, broad and widC: running 
 on a level with the setting on of the tail — G. 

The Rumps — lying bro.\d apart, high, and well 
 covered — 3. 

The Pelvis — wide — 3. 

The Twist — full and broad — 3. 

The Quarters long and thoroughly filled up be- 
 tween the hocks, or hip bones, and the rumps; with 
 a good muscular developoment down the thigh to the 
 hocks — 4. 

The Flank — Moderately deep, full and mellow in 
 proportion to condition — I. 

The Leos not too short, and standing as square 
 and straight behind, as may be compatible with ac- 
 tivity. The bone quite small below the hock and 
 knee; the sinews large and clean, with the fore-arm 
 well developed — 3. 

The Carcass round and straight; its posterior ribs 
 almost circular, extending well back, and springing 
 nearly horizontally from the vertebra, giving in fact, 
 much greater capacitj' than would at first appear — 1. 

The Tail, at its junction, level with the back, 
 long, very slender in its cord, and finishing with a 
 tassel of white hair — 1. 

The Color, in its .shades and degrees is more or 
 less governed by fashion; but in the Devon is always 
 red. Formerly a rich blood red was the favorite col- 
 or, and a test of purity, and now a tomewhat light- 
 er coh)r is in vogue, approaching rather nearer to 
 that of the South Devon, which is a larger, coars- 
 er, stronger animal. In all cases the color grows 
 lighter round the muzzle, while a dark mahogany 
 color, verging almost to a black, and growing yet 
 darker about the head, always was a very question- 
 able color for a ti-ue North Devon, more especially 
 when accompanied by a dark nose — -1. 

The Haib should be short, thick, and fine; and if 
 showing on its surface a fine curl, or ripple, it looks 
 richer in color, and is supposed to indicate a hardier 
 and more thrifty animal — 1. 

The Udder should be such as will afford the best 
 promise of capacity and product — 1. 

Carriaoe. — The Devons having from their excel- 
 lence in the yoke, another destiny besides that of the 
 butcher's block, it is all important that the animal's 
 carriage should indicate as much; but to obtain this, 
 something of the heavy, inert, squarely moulded 
 frame of the merely beefing animal must be relin- 
 quished for a lighter and more active frame — 1. 

QuALiTY.-The skin cla3tic,flexible,and not too thin, 

resting on a rich mellow yielding substance between 
 it and the muscle — 8. 

Same general remarks in regard to points of the 
 Devon bull, as made in reference to the Short-IIorn. 

IIEREFOIIDS— THE COW. 

PuRiTV OF Blood, a-i traced back to the satisfac- 
 tion of committees, to imported blood on both sides, 
 from some known English breeder, or as found in 
 Eyton's Hereford Herd Book; 40. 

The Head, moderately small, with a good width 
 of forehead tapering to the muzzle ; the cheek-bone, 
 rather deep, but clean in the jaw ; the nose light in 
 its color, and the whole head free from fleshiness; 2. 

The Eve full,mild, and cheerful in its expression; 1. 

The Ear of medium size; 1. 

The Horns, light and tapering, long and spread- 
 ing, with an outward and upward turn, giving a gay 
 and lofty expression to the whole head; 3. 

The Neck, of a medium length; full in its junc- 
 tion with the shoulders, spreading well over the 
 shoulder points, and tapering fine to the head; 3. 

T'ae Chest, broad, round and deep ; its floor run- 
 ning well back of the elbows, which with a springing 
 forerib, gives great interior capacity to this all-im- 
 portant portion of the body; 8 

The Brisket, when in flesh, largely developed, de- 
 scending low between the legs, and deep, by cover- 
 ing the anterior portion of tiie sternum, or breast- 
 bone, but never intefering with the action of the 
 animal when in working condition; 3. 

The Shoulder, lying snugly and closely towards 
 the top, and spreading towards the points ; the blade 
 sloping somewhat back, and running pretty well up 
 into the withers, which by rising a very trifle above 
 the level line of the back, gives to the ox a very up- 
 standing, and beautiful fore-end. The whole should- 
 er well clothed with muscle; 3. 

The Crops, fiUmgall up evenly behind the shoul- 
 ders, and blending it smoothly in with the muscles 
 of the back; 2. 

Tre Back, Loin and Hips, should be broad, wide, 
 and level; 4. 

The Rumps should lie nearly, or quite level with 
 the back, and their covering should be abundant, 
 mellow, loose, and freely moving under the hand.thus 
 showing great aptitude to fatten; 4. 

The Pelvis, roomy ; indicated by wide hips,- as 
 already mentioned, and the space between the rumps, 
 which should stand well apart, giving a general 
 breadth to the posterior portion of the animal; 4. 

The Twist broad and full; 2. 

The Hind Quarter, large and thoroughly develop- 
 ed in its upper and more valuable portions, as beef. 
 The thigh gradually tapering to the hook, but mus- 
 cular; 3. 

The Carcass, round throughout; full and capa- 
 cious, with the under line of the belly level, or near- 
 ly so; 1. 

The Flank full and wide; 1. 

The Leos, straight, upright ; firmly placed to sup- 
 port the superincumbent weight ; a strong back sin- 
 ew, but by no means a large, coarse, cannon bone; 3. 

The Tai l, large and full at its point of attachment, 
 but fine in its cord; 1. 

The Carriage, prompt, resolute, and cheerful; and 
 in the ox, gav and lively; 1. 

The Quality is indicated by a flexible, soft, yet 
 substantial skin, resting on a somewhat firm, but 
 rich, mellow, and elastic substance, becoming firmer 
 as the animal approaches its maximum of high con- 
 dition; 8.
