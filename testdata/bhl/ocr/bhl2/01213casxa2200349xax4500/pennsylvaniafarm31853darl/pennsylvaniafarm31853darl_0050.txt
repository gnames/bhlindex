POINTS OF CATTLE— SHANGHAI CHICKENS. 

[Mat, 

The Hair, thick, elose. and furry; 1. 

The Udoer shoulil Ije sueli as will afford the best 
 promise of capacity and product: 1. 

Color, reds or rich browns, oftentimes very dark, 
 with a white or "brookled" face, are now the colors. 
 and markinj; ot tlie lleref jrd, though grey Ilerofords, 
 or cream-colored, wore not uncommon: I.

 Horn. 

AYRSHIRES— THE COW. 

Purity or Blood, as traced back to importations 
 of both dam and sire, under such evidence as will 
 satisfy committees; 40. 

The Head, as in other breeds, small; the face long 
 and narrow; tlie muzzle and nose dark; 2. 

The Eve placid and not strikingly large; 1. 

The Ear of full size, and of an orange color 
 within; 2. 

The IIorns small, tapering with an outward and 
 upward turn, and set on wide apart, the face some- 
 what dishing; 1. 

The Neck of medium length, clean in the throat, 
 very light throughout, and tapering to the head; 1. 

The Shoulders lying snugly to the body, thin at 
 their top, small at their points, not long in the blade, 
 nor loaded with muscle; 3. 

The Chest must retain sufficient width and round- 
 ness to secure constitution. The lightness of the 
 fore-quarter, and the "wedge-shape" of the animal, 
 from the hind-quarter forward, arising more from a 
 small, flat and thin shoulder, than from an undue 
 narrowness of the chest; 6. 

The Crops easily blend in with so thin a shoulder 
 and prevent all hollowness behind; 3. 

The Brisket not over-loading the fore-end, but light; 
 2. 

The B.\ck should be straight and the loin wide, 
 the hips rather high and well spread; 8. 

The Pelvis roomy, causing a good breadth at 
 what is termed the "thurl," or "round-bone," and 
 between the points of the rumps; 4. 

The Quarters long, tolerably muscular, and full 
 in their upper portion, but moulding into the thighs 
 below, which should have a degree of fatness, aifor- 
 ding thus more space for a full udder. The flank 
 well let down, but not heavy; 0. 

The Ribs, behind, spring out very round and full, 
 affording space for a large udder, which by Ayr- 
 shire breeders is considered very essential to secure 
 the milking property ; the whole carcass thus ac- 
 ciuiring increased volume towards its posterior por- 
 tion; 4. 

The Rumps nearly level with the back, projecting 
 but little; 2. 

The Tail thin in its cord, of full length, light in 
 its hair, and set somewhat further into the back than 
 would be admissible with some other breeds; 1. 

The Legs delicate and fine in the bone, inclining 
 to be short, and well knit together at the joints; 1. 

The Udoer in this breed is of more special im- 
 portance, aa the Ayrshires have been bred almost 
 exclusively Xvith reference to their milking properties. 
 The great feature of the udder should be capacity 
 without being fleshy. It should be carried squarely 
 and broadly forward; show icself largely behind. As 
 it rises upward it should not mingle too immediately 
 with the muscle of the thighs, but continue to pre- 
 serve its own peculiar texture of skin — thin, delicate 
 and ample in its folds. The teats should stand wide 
 apart, and be lengthy, but not large and coarse; 6. 

The IIandlixg will show the skin to be of medium 

thickness only, moving freely under the hand and 
 evincing a readiness in the animal to take on flesh 
 when a drain on the constitution is no longer made 
 by the milk-pail; 4. 

The Hair soft and thick, in the phraseology of the 
 country, wooly; 1. 

Color, varies — a dark red — a rich brown — a liver 
 color, or mahogany, running into almost a black ; 
 those very much broken and spotly at the edges on a 
 white ground are the favorite colors at the present 
 time. The light yellow is, however, a c;lor some- 
 times found on very good cows, but these pale colors 
 are objected to from an impression that such belong 
 to animals of less constitution; \. 

Carriage should be light, active, and even gay ; 
 this latter appearance is much promoted by the up- 
 ward turn of the horn; 1.

 Ayrsliire bull, as made in reference to the Short- 
 llorn. — [Boston Cultivator. 

Shanghai Chickens— Henology. 

Mr. Editor: — As the hen-fever is getting up pret- 
 ty high, up this way, and some of the symptoms are 
 begining to show themselves on my good wife, by 
 occasionally hinting about eggs, chickens, hen-hous- 
 es, &c., I thought I would ask a few questions of you, 
 before dipping into the business, as you know, or 
 onght to know, that we expect editors to be able to 
 answer all questions. 

Now what do you think of the variety called shanl-- 
 hiijh, whose name don't belie them ? I tell my wife 
 they ain't got no lx>dy at all, and that when the 
 head is cut off the legs come right apart, — am I 
 right? She says, neighbor Buckingham's wife told 
 her, that they were the beatenest things to lay on the 
 yearth, and that they'd sit and lay both at oust. I 
 don't believe it, because it is contrary to nater. I 
 think they only recline a little, as it were, and — Je- 
 rusalem ! bow can them things set ! my jack knife 
 can set as well as they can. And, I tell you, Mr. 
 Eilitor, they put things out of joint too, dreadfully. 
 When neighbor Buckingham's wife got her Shank- 
 hiijhs home the other day, old Kink happened to 
 hear the rooster crow for the first time, and not 
 knowing anything about the matter, summoned half 
 the niggers on the place to come and help get the old 
 blink-eyed mule out of the crib. Judge of the ex- 
 hibition of teeth and white eyes, on ascertaining the 
 truth. Old Kink says dey don't sit on de roost samo 
 as udiler chicken no how, but dey sits straddle of de 
 stick, cause why, when dey 'tempts to sit same as 
 common chicken, de head ain't liebby 'nuff for de 
 logs, and dey falls off backwards. Correct philosophy 
 that. They sit when they eat, I know, for I've seen 
 'em do it ; and I've seen 'em try to eat standing, but 
 its no go, for when they peck at a grain of corn on 
 the ground, they don't more'n half reach it, but the 
 head bobs right between their legs, making them 
 turn a complete somerset. They may belike a swing- 
 ed cat, — worse than it looks, and that's bad enough, 
 any how. I'd as soon see a pair of tongs or com- 
 passes walking about the yard as these Sliank-liiglis. 
 And I had like to have forgot to tell you, that Pete 
 says they are great liars, cause dey crows long time 
 fore day in de morning, when 'taint day. Kink says, 
 Pete don't 'fleet dat dey legs is so long, dey see day- 
 light a long time 'fore common chicken. 

With all the advantages and disadvantages, I am 
 at a stand what to do; to get or not to get, that's the 
 question. AVhat say you? — [Farmer & Planter.
