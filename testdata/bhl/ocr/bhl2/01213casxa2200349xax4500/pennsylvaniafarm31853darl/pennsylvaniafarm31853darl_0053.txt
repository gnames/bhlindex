KICKING COWS— COAL ASHES, &c.

its violation, but at present, although the practice is 
 continued, we seldom hear of any arrests being 
 made. It is not very difficult to detect this meat; it 
 has a peculiarly bluish appearance, and becomes pu- 
 trid in a much shorter time than good beef. It also 
 takes more of it to weigh a pound, and when cooked 
 tliere is less of it. 

The cattle that are in Johnson's stables, and in fact 
 in all that we have ever visited, are seldom or never 
 allowed to leave them. They are constantly breath- 
 ing the fetid atmosphere of their prisons, their teeth 
 rot out of their jaws, their hoofs grow to an unnatnral 
 length, and turn up something similar to the point of 
 a skate. These are the marks by which a slop-fed 
 cow is generally known, and it is impossible to mis- 
 take them. Sometimes the hair falls off, ulcers break 
 out in various parts of the body, and the hoofs be- 
 come so sore as to render the animal quite lame and 
 unable to stand. It is melancholy to see some of the 
 poor creatures, when they are so fortunate as to get 
 out of their pens for an hour or two, attempting to 
 walk. 

Kicking Cows. 

In my private letters from my venerable friend, 
 David Thomas, I often find valuable scraps, like 
 the one below, which I can detach from the corres- 
 pondence without breach of confidence. 

When I was in the habit of milking half a dozen 
 or more cows myself, (which, maugre the M. D., I 
 did, till recently,) I tried the plan detailed below, on 
 the vicious kickers, and found it to answer admira- 
 bly. One blow on the cow's leg followed every kick 
 until a cure was effected. 

It should be borne in mind, however, that cows of- 
 ten kick fromyrar, and still oftener from sore teats. 
 Kindness and care are the remedies then ; blows on- 
 ly aggravate the mischief. — [Prairie Farmer,

A Perverse Animal Subdued. — A late article on 
 Kicking Cows, in the Albany Cultivator, has remind- 
 ed me of a story that was told nearly fifty years ago, 
 by a worthy Englishman, with whom I was intimate. 
 An itinerant was at a nobleman's to exhibit feats of 
 horsemanship, and the people had collected from far 
 and near, among whom was my friend. When the 
 man had done with his own horses, he turned and 
 said "Now, my lord, I am willing to ride any horse 
 of yours in the same manner." Il.aving one remark- 
 ably stubborn, the nobleman, to have some sport, 
 told a groom to bring her out. The stranger then 
 deliberately mounted, and urged her to move, but 
 not one step would she stir. After a pause, he qui- 
 etly dismounted, gave her one severe stroke with his 
 whip, and again resumed his seat in the saddle. The 
 mare continued immovable, but the man preserved 
 his temper, and got down quietly a second time, re- 
 peating the blow, but with no better success. After 
 the third stroke, however, she was completely sub- 
 dued, and moved forward with perfect obedience. 

It now became evident that the design of the horse- 
 man was, to give the animal time to associate the 
 idea of her disobedience with the -stroke that follow- 
 ed. When this was established, she was willing to 
 move. 

On the reverse, if a shower of blows had been 
 dealt out, as thousands of horsemen would have done, 
 the mare would have no time to reflect, and both she 
 and her rider been roused into fury. With good 
 temper, great savings might be made in the article 
 of whips. 

Coal AsliPs. 

Mr. Editor: — In your weekly paper of 12th June, 
 I notice an inquiry from a correspondent, "whether 
 coal ashes can be used with any benefit in agricul- 
 ture ?" And as I have not ."leen a reply to this ques- 
 tion in any subsequent number of the Farmer, I will 
 venture to give my own experience in the matter, 
 small though it may be. 

About the year 1840, while publishing the Far' 
 mer's Gazette, at New Haven, I found a heap of an- 
 thracite ashes in my garden in the spring — the ac- 
 cumulated siftiiigs from two stoves during the previ- 
 ous winter. Having seen the suggestion in some 
 agricultural paper, that these ashes were of some 
 value as a fertilizing agent, it occurred to me that I 
 might try the experiment without cost. According- 
 ly, when about to commence the operation of gar- 
 dening, I spread the ashes over the surface of the 
 garden, as evenly as possible. There were some- 
 two or throe cart loads of them, and they had lain 
 in a snug heap near the centre of a small garden of 
 not more than four or five rods square. Across the 
 spot where the heap had lain, I had a bed of com- 
 mon blood beats, and a few rows of string beans. — 
 The general effect of the ashes on all parts of the 
 garden was evidently good ; but on the particular 
 spot which had been occupied by the ash heap, the 
 result was really surprising. The growth of beets 
 and beans, in that part of the beds, was nearly 
 double that of the same vegetables beyond the limits 
 of the heap. So marked was the difference, that it 
 was prominently perceptible to the eye as far as the 
 garden could be seen. The soil at New Haven, as 
 you are probably aware, is a light sand. 

I have no doubt that coal ashes are worth some- 
 thing as a fertilizer ; and that on farms within two 
 or three miles of any of our New England cities, 
 they will pay for carting. Generally, I suppose, 
 householders in cities will be glad to give them to 
 any person who will take them away. I think ot 
 trying their virtues on a portion of my mowing, by 
 spreading them either this fall or early next spring ; 
 and if they have any material effect, you may possi- 
 bly hear from me again.— [New England Farmer. 

Sulphur for l.ice on Calves, &c< 

The September number of the S/ock Her/iMer quo- 
 ting from the Genesee Farmer, recommended sulphur 
 fed to animals as death to all such vermin. I tried 
 it on some calves, so covered witli lice tliat the outer 
 ends of their hairs were thick with them. Toliac- 
 eo arid other remedies, had but little effect. I fed in 
 salt and meal, giving a spoonful to each calf alM)ut 
 twice a week. In two weeks not a louse could 
 be found. A neighbor who has often used the 
 same remedy, on all kinds of animals witli perfect 
 success, assures me it shouUl be given in fair weath- 
 er, or the animals housed, else their is a liability of 
 taking cold and injury being done to the animals.

Impoutatiov of Cattle. — The cattle growers of 
 Madison county, Ohio, says the Cleveland Herald, 
 have organized a cattle importing company, the cap- 
 ital stock, S>10,0nO, all taken. The eoni|)any will 
 shortly send one of their numt>er to England, to make 
 selections and purchases. A similar company is 
 being formed in Indiana, wit>i a capital of §20,000.
