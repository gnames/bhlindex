Effect of Deep PLoucniNG. — A correspondent of 
 the New England Farmer, states that : 

"A striking instance of the benefits resulting from 
 continued deep ploughing, was brought to our notice 
 yesterday, on viewing the cultivated ground of A. 
 M. Whipple, Esq., on the banks of the Connecticut 
 river, near Lowell. This land was naturally a light 
 and sandy soil. His men were engaged in gathering 
 in the crop ot hay from an extensive field, which 
 yielded more than two tons to the acre. The inqui- 
 ry arose, by what means was the crop made so abun- 
 dant, on hind so shallow? His answer was, deep 
 plowiny mainly. That for eight or ton years past, he 
 usually ploughed hoeloe indies deep. That he put on 
 his grounds but a light dressing of stable manure — 
 made no compost whatever — but relied almost entire- 
 ly on the improvement of the soil, by turning the fur- 
 rows deep. His crops were quite equal to those we 
 have been accustomed to see on strong land, highly 
 manured." ,'■' * ''Similar benefits were apparent 
 in the growing crops of corn and oats, in the adjoin- 
 ing lote."

 CoRJi. — The first in rotation is the most importanj. 
 ijrain crop, the older the sod the better, if well set 
 with natural grasses, mostly limed one year or the 
 fall previous on the sod, or after ploughing, forty or 
 fifty bushels per acre, ploughed about six inches 
 deep, either in the fall, o;pen winter weather, or as 
 soon as the frost is out in .the spring. The team for 
 this usually consists of one yoke of oxen, and pair 
 of horses before them, or two yoke of oxen; the time 
 of planting about the 1st of 5th month, (May) pre- 
 vious to which harrow first lengthwise with the fur 
 row, then cross, and re-cross, diagonally, or at right 
 angles; if not well mellowed harrow again, then, 
 strike out four and a half feet between the rows, if 
 in drills, and four by four and a half or four, if both 
 ways; if the former,drop three grains every two feet,in- 
 tending two plants to remain; if the latter,four orfive 
 grains to the hill,tUree or four plant- to stand. Some 
 place a handful of compost of hen manure, ashes 
 and plaster, in the hill previous to dropping; this in- 
 sures an early start; cover with a hoe. A good crop 
 will depend much upon the after culture. As soon 
 as the plants are all fairly up, run the cultivator 
 through twice in a row, then apply plaster, a hand- 
 ful to half dozen hills; this will take about half 
 bushel per acre; heind hoe once, and when about six 
 inches high, thin out to the requisite number; this 
 can best be done directly after a rain, as it disturbs 
 the remaining plants less; at intervals of a week give 
 it three more dressings; some plough it the last time, 
 and pass the cultivator once to harrow out the 6a//i-.s; 
 it may then stand until the labors of harvest, and 
 preparation for fall seeding are accomplished. About 
 this time the grain will be glazed and nearly ripe. 
 It is then cut off about one foot from the ground, 
 with stall: knives, and placed in shocks of forty-eight 
 hills each, resting upon horses, formed of two or 

more hills, twisted together by the tops ; the siuhba 
 are cut with a hoe, in the mornings before the dew 
 gets off the standing corn, or they are knocked off in 
 the winter, when the ground is frozen. In two or 
 three weeks it will be sufficiently cured to commence 
 husking. Cut the horses, throw the shocks down, 
 husk and bind the fodder with straw, into four or five 
 sheaves, to be shocked until the husking is finished, 
 then stacked or ricked by the barn yard. The sound 
 ears are hauled to the crib, leaving soft ones and 
 nubbins to be placed by themselves, for present feed- 
 iftg. Cribs are usually four and half feet wide by 
 ten high; slats running perpendicular half inch apart, 
 and elevated two feet from the ground, by tinned 
 posts. 

. Seed. — Varieties of yellow flint, inclining to gourd 
 seed, are universal — the red cob is in best repate, a 
 deep grain, fourteen to eighteen rowed, large cob 
 and strong growth of fodder. Previous to planting 
 soak in saltpetre water, one or two days, and roll in 
 plaster. This crop is subject to attacks from the cut 
 .vorm; best preventive, fall or winter ploughing; wire 
 or heart worm, which, working Lenealh the surface 
 is difficult to counteract; moles, these maybe trapped, 
 and birds — to keep oif the latter, some inclose their 
 fields with twine stretched on poles; others scatter 
 loose grain about, after the corn comes up, and until 
 it gets fairly started. 

The average yield per acre is fifty bushels ; price 
 fifty-five cents, for the last ten years — from actual 
 accounts.
