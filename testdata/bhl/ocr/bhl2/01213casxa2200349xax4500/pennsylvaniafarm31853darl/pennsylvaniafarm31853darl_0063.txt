We take great pleasure in offering to the readers I 
 of the Farm Journal, the above original and oxeel- 
 ient engravings of Shanghai, or Cochin China Fowls, 
 recently imported by Wm- C. Ruilmau, Esq., of Phil- 
 adelphia. They were drawn from life, and engraved 
 by E. Clarkson, wood engraver, Philadelphia, and are 
 iiighly creditable to his skill as a correct artist, and 
 faithful delineator. The portraits of Southdown 
 Buck, and Chester county Boar, in former numbers 
 of the Farm Journal, were also engraved by'him, and 
 have been pronounced the best which have appear- 
 ed ill any periodical in this country. 

In respect to these Fowls Mr. Radman writes us, 
 "the artist has made e.^coellent likeneses. Thoy are 
 of the Cochin China breed; the Cook fifteen months 
 old, weighing twelve pounds, and the hen eleven 
 months, weighing 9| lbs. They were imported — the 
 Cock and two Hens — in the ship Horatio, of New 
 Bedford, and arrived in January last, In ninety-.soven 
 days direct from Shanghai." They are the pure 
 cinnamon Jiufff, — and a friend in Philadelphia, who 

is well booked up in the present state of the chick- 
 en market, says, ".they are worth to-day, in London, 
 Five Hundred pounds sterling the trio!" Mr. Rud- 
 man informs us that he is "soiling the eggs at twen- 
 ty dollars per dozen, and that nine dozen are already 
 ordered at those Jiigh prices." We shall only sa}-, 
 "on our own hook," that, after seeing, these fowls, 
 we were forced to. concur in the general sentjinent 
 that they are the finest specimens of Shanghaies j-'ef 
 imported into the United States. They are well calcu- 
 lated to increase the prevailing epidemic, to a very 
 great extent, and even to affect those, Uke our corre'^- 
 pondont J. K. B., who have heretoforp stood imper- 
 vious tq, all i^oioi diseases. Those'" seein ti) as to be 
 model specimens of Po'.ilt/y, and as we survey tli"ir 
 liroad an<l prominent breasts, deep and heavy bodic«, 
 with small and beautiful necks ivnd heads, wc fei.l 
 for the first time a kind of ckicknx hearkducss creep- 
 ing over us. Although low and vpry near the ground, 
 .as chickens ought t<r be, thejf will stand higficr in tin- 
 estimvtion of good. judgi^s, than some whose great- 
 est ■eeommcndation i^ that they can cat off an ortiir 
 nary dining table without .ftrnlc'iinj
