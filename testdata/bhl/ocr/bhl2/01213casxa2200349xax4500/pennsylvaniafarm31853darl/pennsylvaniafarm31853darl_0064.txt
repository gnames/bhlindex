PORTRAITS OF STOCK— HEDGES. 

[Mat, 

Portraits of Stock. 

"The Editors of the Pennsylvania Farm Journal, 
 after discussing pretty sharply the portraits of ani- 
 mals as given in the Agricultural papers, and also 
 in the New York Transactions, announce their de- 
 termination to tolerate none but faithful portraits ; 
 and for this purpose they intend to use only daguer- 
 reotypes. Ila, ha, ha! Good friends! If you do 
 not get against a stump before you get far you will 
 be lucky. The Daguerreotype is capable of being 
 the most lying and unfaithful of all processes. You 
 will see better when you get there." 

We copy the above from the Prairie Farmer. Will 
 that paper tell us of any tliinr/ that is not "capable" 
 of being twisted and perverted from its true and 
 proper uses. Where the object is to flatter the ani- 
 mal, and not to give a truthful portrait, we grant the 
 daguerreotype may be made "the most lying and un- 
 faithful of all processes." The fault here is not in the 
 daguerreotype but in the intent of the owner. If the 
 object is merely to make a handsome Xookvag picture, 
 there is no use in having the daguerreotype, or the 
 animal either. An artist can make a figure of a 
 cow, or bull, or sheep, without seeing either of them 
 before him. When, however, a portrait is wanted, 
 and we can conceive of no use in illustrations for ag- 
 ricultural journals unless they are- really portraits, 
 we contend that twenty artists can be found, who 
 can copy from a daguerreotype, for one who, like 
 the late lamented J. A. Woodside, can take a por- 
 trait from nature. ". - , 

AVe had occasion not long since, to enquire in Phil- 
 adelphia for an animal painter, and were roeom- 
 ded by several artists to one, who we were told, had 
 a great talent that way, and was the best in the city. 
 We employed him, to draw some well formed, and 
 very neat, improved stock. When finished, their 
 backs were hollow, like the concave of the 'moon, in 
 her first quarter, rumps sharp and angular, heads 
 coarse and heavy, and such subjects altogether as 
 would be likely to attract, and retain a large flock of 
 crows, in the anticipation of an early repast. When 
 we enquired of him ichy he made such caricatures, 
 we found he had endeavored to make them as ugly as 
 possible, as he remarked they looked more "pictur- 
 esque and rustic like."

Osage Orange Hedges. 

We clip the following from the Prairie Farmer,from 
 which it appears in Illinois, the "Osage Orange Ques- 
 tion," has not proved so difiicult to settle, as the 
 " Strawberr-y Question" m some other place--. A com- 
 pact fence against horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, stud 
 chickens, in three years from the time it was set out, 
 speaks well for the deep soil of the Prairies. If it 
 would do that in five years in Pennsylvania we 
 should be satisfied. 

As remarked lately by one of our correspondents. 
 Fencing is a very heavy item, and tax upon our farm- 
 ers, and from what we have seen of the Osage Orange 
 here, we are inclined to favor its being planted. It 

grows rapidly and strongly, has sharp thorns to the 
 ground, and is very hardy. We have seen the tips 
 or extremities,of late growth, for two or three inches> 
 killed by the winter, but this does not occur with the 
 old and hard wood. The hedge must, of course, be 
 kept trimmed down, so as to become stiff. One of our 
 friends tells us of having lately seen a heifer with 
 her head partly through an Osage Orange hedge, 
 and so fast that she could not move it either way, 
 and by her bellowing and antics, resting on her fore- 
 feet, with her hind ones up in the air, and the com- 
 motion with the stock around her, he concluded one 
 experiment would be satisfactory. 

We have seen a few good osage orange hedges in 
 this State and Ohio; and we append an extract from 
 a private letter written by our excellent friend S. 
 Fi'ancis, of the Illinois Journal. He says: — "Our 
 agricultural committee have made examinations of 
 osage orange hedges in this county; and we found 
 some that had been set out only three years, and 
 then turned out — making an efiiciont fence against 
 horses, cattle,^sheep, hogs, pigs, and even chickens. 
 We can now say "Eureka !" We have found it. — 
 The osage orange, in our county, has been proved to 
 make a good and effectual hedge fence. I would 
 strongly recommend, however, that it be cut back, 
 far more severely than usually, in order to give it 
 a thick bottom ; for on that its main excellence de- 
 pends. 

We find, also, that the prejudices of our farmers, 
 against this species of fence, are fast giving way, and 
 the numbers of those who plant hedges, constantly 
 and rapidly increasing. One gentleman told me he 
 had sold plants enough, the past season, to make a 
 hedge from this city to Philadelphia. * * * » 

What a beautiful sight will therich prairies of Illi- 
 nois present, when covered with farms enclosed by 
 the osage orange ! and this soon to be done, in cen- 
 tral Illinois. 

I have often had occasion to say, with you, that by 
 helping to introduce this plant. Professor Turner has 
 done more good in his day and generation, tha i if 
 he had expended a long life in pounding Greek and 
 Latin into the brains of that class, who prefer an- 
 cient lore to living and useful knowledge." 

One word more. There is a point which time, 
 alone, can fully settle — Will this hedge last? — 
 Wil! the plant, when old, bear the constant mutila- 
 tion necessary to keep the hedge in shape ? Analo- 
 gy and its native habits are in our favor. Though a 
 tall tree, on the rich river bottoms, the Madura is, 
 like the native Crab, a round-headed, long-lived 
 Dwarf, along the dry prairie borders, and in the thin 
 upland soils of its native region. What soil and sun 
 effect there, art can more perfectly accomplish here.
