The reader will observe in the two last tables, a 
 second column marked No. 2; Speaking of this the 
 learned Professor says — "The necessary amendments 
 are made under No. 2. 

The possession of a paper like either of the three 
 above tables, would not signify much in the hands of 
 the^rdinary farmer; but in it he has his five dollars 
 worth. That is the price charged for the document, 
 and if really and fairly made, has cost §25 worth of 
 labor. But what use can the farmer make of it ? He 
 does not understand sufficiently these elements and 
 their functions to be guided by such a table. 

We have it! Does it not put you in mind of some- 
 thing you have heard before. "Walk in gentlemen, 
 only a sixpenec." But when you arfe fairly in,iyou 
 discover that the charge for going out, is more than 
 for going in. Well, as the farmer cannot understand 
 this, he must have a letter from Professor Mapes to 
 explain it. (April 1853, p. 1) "We agree with Mr. 
 Browne, that $5 is too small a sum for the analysis 
 ef a soil; and for that reason we employ those who 
 choose to work at that price, and use our time in 
 writing the accompanying letters of advice for which 
 we charge $25 each." 

But of what use or supposed use is this table of 
 constituents? By the first column we know how 
 much of each constituent is already in the soil; and 

by the latter, or No. 2, we are informed how much is 
 needed to make our soil fertile without putting on 
 any more; or in other words, a perfect soil. Any- 
 where between none at all of a constituent, and the 
 number or proportion in the 2d column; and we must 
 goon adding,at least so says the learned Profess- 
 or. (April 1853, page l.)"Younee8l not attempt to add 
 "the whole required quantity to your soil in one, two 
 "or three years, but by continuing, the use of the 
 "amendments recommended, with reference to the 
 "relative proportions only, you will obtain full crops 
 "and eventually place your soil in a condition, to be- 
 ''worked with very slight quantities of farm or other 
 "manures." 

Accompanying each of these tables is to be found 
 the letter of advice as sent by the learned Professor, 
 and based upon the several tables. 

By a perusal of these three letters, the reader will 
 find that substantially the same amendments are pre- 
 scribed in all three cases, yet other than their being 
 about the same as regards Sand and Alumina, they 
 difier as much as could be expected, 

The first soil contains of vegetable matter,.43560 lbs. 

The second " " " " .13068 lbs. 

The third " " " " .7623 lbs. 

The first soil contains of lime, .17424 lbs. 

The second ' - - . .9801 lbs. 

The third « « <■ ... .47915 i]^g\ 

The first contains of Phos. Acid, faint trace. 

The second " " " none at all 

The third " " " - - .1089 lbs. 

He recommends for all of them: 
 Muck, 

Potash, or ashes, * 

Bones dissolved in sul. acid, 
 Salt and lime mixture. 
 Night soil, or its equivalent, 
 Peruvian guano. 
 Charcoal dust. 
 AVill any body tell me, what else could be recom- 
 mended? 

Each letter abounds in advice about other little 
 matt?rs, fo be found in i.ny agricultural book. 

It is a familiar fact to yon all that one bushel per 
 acre of Plaster will manifest its improvement, so as 
 to be observed by any one. The dose of Peruvian 
 Guano is only aboutSOO lbs. to the acre. Dissolved 
 bones are rr^rely applied in larger quantities than 
 throe bushels to the acre. 

We are told by Professor Mapes that 100 lbs. of 
 his improved super Phospjiate of lime will increase 
 the crop one-third. 

If we calculate the weight of an acre of soil to 
 the depth of nine inches, we will find that it is 
 2178000 lbs. 

One hundred of the learned Professors' fertilizer 
 contains 19 lb. of Phosphoric acid. If 19 lbs. of Phos. 
 acid can do so much good, when spread over such a
