large surface, there must be some reason for it, be- 
 cause soils that contain much larger (juantkies of 
 this material are benefited by it. 

The learned Prof essor recommends dissglved bones 
 in all three of the above cases, yet the one soil has 
 none of this material in it; the one has a faint trace, 
 and the other has 1-2000 or one pound foi- every two 
 thousand of soil, and when calculated will be found 
 to amount to 1089 lbs., which would cost $145 27 cts. 
 provided resort were had to the learned Professor's 
 improved super phosphate of lime to supply it. If 
 this be correct what use then to know the exact 
 amount in the soil ? . AVhy not use the fertilizer 
 without knowing ? 

As to the lime no one can help seeing the great 
 disparity. The third specimen has more than one 
 pound of lime for every square foot of ground, yet 
 the learned Professor although he says, that it does 
 not need lime as much as it does other amendments, 
 yet he prescribes lime, when he comes to tell this in- 
 dividual the amendments he should put on his soil. , 
 Nothing can be more evident than that the quan- 
 tity that already exists in the so'ls, generally to be 
 found in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, has no 
 weight in the choice or application of amendments. 
 There is one matter that may have struck the at> 
 tention of the reader, and that is, how it could be 
 possible for a soil to contain 2.20 of lime and not the 
 slightest trace of carbonic acid. 

Mr. Bradley may have been a very able chemist, 
 but to avoid suspicion of error, he should have ex- 
 plained the state of combination in which he found 
 this lime. It could not have been caustic lime, be- 
 cause as caustic lime it could not exist in the soil for 
 any considerable length of time, before it would take 
 carbonic acid from the air. Too little is yet known 
 of agricultural chemistry, for any man to be guided 
 entirely by an analysis of the soil. Too little is 
 known of the laws of agricultural chemistry for any 
 man to be able to say why 10 lbs. of Phosphoric acid 
 added to a soil which already contains 1089 lbs. can 
 be so beneficial. 

(Albany Cultivator, April, 1853, p. lU.) "Farm- 
 "ers have been told that analysis would show the ex- 
 "act composition of their soils, and its wants ; that if 
 "any ingredient should be deficient, the chemist 
 "could point out with accuracy of mathematics, the 
 "substance and the quantity that would restore its 
 "fertility, without resorting to the random and em- 
 "pircal course of applying a whole set of fertilizers 
 "in the shape of common manure. Experiments of 
 "this sort have been abundantly tried,' a few have 
 "succeeded, and these have been widely published ; 
 "most of them have failed, and the failures have 
 "slowly found their way among the intelligent por- 
 "tion of the farming community." 

If the secoud column means nothing, it shoufd not 
 bo added to the table; if it means any thing, it must 

be, that the farmer is expected to bring his ground 
 crop to that point at some time. Professor Mapes 
 tells us he does not expect this to be done in one, two, 
 or three years". But let us see if- it can ever be 
 done. I 

By reference to the 2d column of the 2d and 3d 
 tables, both of which were compiled by Mr. W. H. 
 Bradley, a gentleman (so says Professor Mapcs) of 
 an uncommon ability, a student and ehix of the 
 learned gentleman. 

As to item of organio'matter. â€¢ The table No. 2 re- 
 quires that this ingredient be brought to 10-100. No. 
 3 only requires that it should be brought to 5-100. 

Why this wide difference, amounting to tons of 
 manure, should be established, between these two 
 soils, which are exactly alike as to silex'and alumina, 
 I cannot tell. But you have it so laid down. The 
 first of these two would have to apply one hundred 
 tons of dry manure to the acre. 

As to the item of Potash. No. 2 is required to add 
 potash until it contains3.-100. No. 3 is only requir- 
 ed to bring his land up to 1-500, or the 20-100 of 1- 
 000. ^' 

As Potash is a very costly article, this is a serious 
 difference. No. 2 would require 63340 lbs. of Pot- 
 ash, ai^^ No. 3 would only require 4356 lbs. If we 
 estimate the ordinary Potash of commerce at five 
 cents per lb., and 100 lbs. of commercial Potash to 
 yield about 00 lbs. of real Potash, the Potash would 
 cost 8 J cents per lbs. The real Potash for No. 2 would 
 cost J5445 00. That for No. 3 would cost $363 00. 
 No. 2 is required to bring his land up to 5-100 of 
 Phosphoric acid. He would have 107811 lbs. of the 
 acid to furnish, and calculated by the price of the 
 improved super Phosphate of lime, he would have 
 to outlay $13476 37i cts. 

No. 3 would have to outlay for 8712 lbs. $1089. 
 Let any one look at the above, and say whether it 
 is within the bounds of reason . for any one to ex- 
 pect to be abfe to bring his land up to this mark, or 
 any way near to it. Is it not ridiculous to set down 
 figures in this manner, which either moan nothing, 
 or mean folly ? 

I cannot help thinking that such wide discrepan- 
 cies between these tables are very extraordinai-y, arid ^ 
 that they were both set down by Mr. W. II. Bradle}-, 
 and endorsed by Mr. Mapes, that neither of these 
 gentlemen, in their zeal for the mineral theory, 
 have ever stopped to count the cost, but have set the 
 tables down at random, and have no fixed ideas on 
 the subject. 

I hope the wisdom of our Legislature will point 
 out to that body the propriety of faking the matter 
 into their own hands, and out of that of gentlemen 
 interested in the sale of fertilizers.
