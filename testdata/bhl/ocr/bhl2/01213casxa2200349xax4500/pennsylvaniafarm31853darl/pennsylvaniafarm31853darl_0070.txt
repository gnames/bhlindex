 Polishing Plows. 

The application of Sulphuric acid, diluted with its 
 owu weight of watoi-, t ' the mould-board of a plow, 
 and allowing it to remain on the iron twentj-four 
 liours, would bo calculated to eat the surface into 
 holes, and destroy the iron. Dilute Sulphuric acid 
 will not only dissolve the oxides of iron: but will de- 
 stroy the metal. 

If those who wish to spare themselves th-e trouble 
 of polishing a rusty mould-ljoard, will have recourse 
 to muriatic acid, (f^uite as cheap an article,) they 
 will find that this acid will not touch the iron, but 
 will render the rust soluble and easily removed. — 
 I would not advise allowing the surface to remain 
 luoist with any acid twenty-four hours. Muriatic 
 ;wid will do th3 w.irk in five minutes— and sliould 
 be eitlier washed off, or cleansed by running through 
 the soil v.'ithout delay. G. B. B.,

Rape Seed. 

Prospect Farm, April C, 1953. 

J. L. Darlinuion: 

"Dear Sir — Finding that rnpe, or 
 rape seed, is by some considered a profitable crop, I 
 would like to know more aliout it than I do. Indeed I 
 know nothing about it. Will you please to puljlish in 
 the Farm Journal how it is raised, when and how the 
 seed is sown, how the crop is cultivated, when and 
 how the seed is gathered, and how oil is manufac- 
 tured from it. Also, what kind of soil is most suit- 
 able for it. 

Will it do to plant strawberry plants any time du- 
 ring summer?" 

We have but very li'tle knowledge of this crop, in 
 the United States, and do not at present know of any 
 place where it is oultivatoJ. In England it is grown 
 extensively, chiefly for the oil, expressed from the 
 seeds, and is considered very profitable, although 
 rather exhausting to the land. It belongs to the 
 Brassica family, and likes a deep, rich and dry soil, 
 although often groAvn on reclaimed marjhes, as a 
 first crop. In England the season for sowing, is the 
 same as the common turnip, either broad oast or in 
 rows, and is transplanted the latter part of summer, 
 in rows a foot apart, and six inches in the row, or if 
 the land is rich, one foot to eigliteen inches apart, is 
 thought to ensure a better crop of seed, than when 
 closer. 

It-is also sometimes sown broad cost, and pastur^ 
 ed off in the fall and winter with sheep. The roots 
 remaing over winter in the ground, go to seed the 
 following season, but the yield is not equal to where 
 they are transplanted. 

Making allowance for the difference of climate, 
 rape, for seed, probably should be managed here as 
 cabbage or turnips. 

Great care is necessary in harvesting the seed, to 
 pi'event its being shaken off,or exposed to high windst 
 and it requires to be threshed out as soon as reaped" 

The produce amounts to 40 or 50 bushels to the acre. 
 The green leaves and dry haulm are considered ex- 
 cellent for stock, and the rape cake left, after the 
 seeds are expressed, are often used as a top dressing 
 for different crops. 

' In regard to strawberries, they may be transplant-- 
 ed at any time of summer, advantage being taken of 
 a damp spell of weather. If put out in July, August 
 or September, after the young runners have acquir- 
 ed strength, and become well established, (and none 
 others should be planted, )they will become rooted be- 
 fore winter, and if slightly protected from being 
 heaved out by frosts, will bear a fair crop the follow- 
 ing season. 

Premium list of New York State Agricultural , 
 Society. 

We have received, just as our paper is going to 
 press, a Journal extra, of the New York Agricul- 
 ural Society, contaiuing list of Premiums for pres- 
 ent year. The exhibition is to be held at Saratoga, ' 
 on the 20th, 21st, 22d and 2Sd of September. The 
 range of articles for competition is very wide, em" 
 bracing stock of all kinds, and their produce in but" 
 tei and cheese; wool and silk, domestic and other 
 manufactures, needle, shell and wax work, flowers 
 and fruit. These latter present quite a large list. 
 There are also premiums for paintings, animal paint- 
 ings and drawings; stoves and silver, ware, cutlery; 
 management of farms; experiments hi draining; ex- 
 periments in the preparation of Flax, as a substitute 
 for wool and cotton, $100 premium; experiments in 
 the cultivation of Potatoes, |125 premium. 

There' are also premiums for hay presses, a' large 
 list of farm implements, hydraulic rams, best improv- 
 ed tiles, hay and cattle weighing scales, $20; best 
 plow, S25; best lot of butter, made by girls under 
 twenty-one years of age, silver cup; second best,pair 
 butter knives; third best, set tea spoons; fourth, sil- 
 ver medal . 

Altogether, the premium list is one of the most lib- 
 eral character, and highly creditable to the enter- 
 prise, and public spirit of the Empire State. We 
 hope our own State Society will soon be able to offer 
 similar inducements to competitors. The Keystone . 
 must not be behind hand in any thing. 

Ileiimneraiive premiums, paying for at least all ex 
 penses and trouble, with a reward to superior skill 
 and diligence, and operating as real inducements, are 
 the great causes of the success at the State fairs in 
 New York and Ohio. 

Rich Men may east large offerings into the trea- 
 sury without the slightest personal inconvenience or 
 self-denial ; but when the poor widow casts in hertwo 
 mites, which is all her living, we are sure that so 
 exemplary an act of self-denial results from a prt>- 
 found sense of her obligation to God.
