Given under my hand, at Rowan, in Normandy, 
 July 1st, 1851. Z. PIMONT. 

I do hereby certify that I shipped the two Norman- 
 dy Diligence Colts, bought by Mr. Samuel Holman, 
 of Z. Pimont, on the 8th of July, A. D. 1851, on 
 board the Packet Ship Scianne, Capt. Williams, con- 
 signed to R. H. Hopkins & Co., N. Y. I am well ac- 
 quainted with Mr. Pimont, and with this stock of 
 Horses, and know that they are thorough Diligence. 
 These horses are held in high estimation here on ac- 
 count of their uncommon bone and muscular power, 
 quick action and durability, and I consider the pair 
 sent, a fair specimen of the stock. 

Given under my hand, at Havre, in France, July 
 10th, 1851. Y. BARBE. 

We do certify that the gray horses, consigned by 
 Mr. S.amuel Holman. to us, were received from on 
 board the Packet Ship Scianne, Capt. Williams, on 
 the 12th day of August, A. D. 1851, in good con- 
 dition, and delivered them according to his orders, 
 one to bis brother, Mr. P. Holman, and the other to 
 Dr. M. Brown, of Ohio. 

Given under our hands at New York, Aug. 15th,

Corn Planting. 

A friend has kindly sent us a manuscript of Pro- 
 ceedings of a recent meeting of the "Philadelphia 
 Society for promoting Agriculture," which we are 
 pleased to be able to bring before the readers of the 
 Farm Journal. 

Philadelphia Society for promoting Agriculture. 
 Meeting April 6, 1853. 

Debate on Corn Planting. Subject proposed by 
 Dr. Gouverneur Emerson. 

Dr. Emerson wishes to learn the opinion of mem- 
 bers, and their experience as to the comparative ad- 
 vantages of planting corn in hills, or by the drill. He 
 preferred the latter. His drills Were at four feet dis- 
 tance, and the corn was dropped one grain for every 
 foot. This, however, he thought too close — especial- 
 ly if a drought occur in the latter part of the season. 
 He thought five feet distance, and one foot apart, the 
 best for average seasons. This had produced excel- 
 lent crops. With him the chief objection to drilling 
 corn arose from the drought, but even in foul ground 
 better crops had been yielded by such planting, than 
 in hills at equal distances, in the usual way. He 
 dropped but one grain in each hill, and re-planted if 
 necessary. 

Mr. James Gowen had planted in drills. The 
 plan had been tried in the South, and objected to on 
 account of the oora Jiriiiff, as it was termed, that is 
 becoming scorched in appearance from the tall luxu- 
 riant corn, not having free air and space for its de- 
 velopment. He always drilled ia clean land, well 
 prepared, and harrowed in sun-shine, between 10 A. 
 M. and 3 P. M. Then he drills with confidence, at 
 three feet distant, and one foot apart — has succeeded 
 perfectly. His only objection was the great destruc- 
 tion caused by high winds in the months of August 
 and September. The corn in drills presents a broad 
 and almost continuous sheet to the winds, and hav- 
 ing less root support was more prostrated. 

President (Dr. Elwyn.) Has Mr. Gowen no trouble 
 from weeds ? 

Mr. Gowen— None whatever. If the ground be 
 well prepared, one or two hoe-harrowings in a year, 
 are abundant to keep it clean both from weeds and 
 grass. I am satisfied that one of my crops averaged 
 more than one hundred bushels shelled corn to the 
 acre, prior to the occurrence of an autumnal storm. 
 Mr. C. W. Harrison said that the proper distance 
 for planting should be determined by the quality of 
 the soil, the quantity and kind of manure, and the 
 amount of labor. To those who were favored on these 
 three points, drill planting might be preferable. But 
 considerations of economy and profit attached him to 
 the old fashioned hills— say four feet by four feet, 
 four grains planted, and three stalks cultivated to 
 the hill. Thus treated, his crops had averaged sev- 
 enty-three bushels and one peck to the acre. A great 
 indication was to stir the ground, and keep down the 
 weeds. This, with the drill, had been found diflicult, 
 without a resort to hand labor, and in many places 
 drilling had been abandoned. 

Mr. a. S. Roberts thought that the first thing to 
 be done, was to make the ground rich. Corn could 
 not be over manured. The general err»r was to put 
 in too little manure. 

Dr. Emerson had forgotten to state, that during the 
 summer before last, a very dry one, as members 
 would recollect, he had a field of drilled corn, which 
 he had, on account of the drought, almost given up 
 as ruined, yet eventually it proved to be but slightly 
 injured. 

Mr. Harrison — Had Dr. Emerson any in hills for 
 comparison? 

Dr. Emerson — 1 had, and I never, other things 
 being the same, saw corn in hills equal to that which 
 had been drilled. 

President — Has Dr. Emerson ever heard of one 
 hundred and sixty bushels per acre ? 

Dr. Emerson— No sir, and certainlyl never saw it 
 measured ! 

Dr. McCrea had produced a fine crop in hills, four 
 feet by three feet and a half, without manure. He 
 had simply turned under the sod, no stalk was less 
 than eleven feet high. 

President — How old was the sod ? 
 Dr. MoCrea — Untouched since 1828. I think that 
 poudrette and planting in drills would have improv- 
 ed my crop. 

Mr. J. G. Fisher wished to inquire what quantity 
 of poudrette was thought the best. 

Dr. McCrea — With a quart to the hill, the yield 
 has been enormous. 

Mr. Isaac W. Roberts — My crops have averaged 
 for twenty years, ninety bushels to the acre. I have 
 used poudrette ever since 1 have been able to got it. 
 I plant in hills four feet by four feet — four grains 
 and a handful of poudrette to each hill.
