CORN PLANTING— SALE OF COWS, &c. 

59 

Mr. Isaac Newtov thought four feet ten inches, 
 by four feet ten inches, afforded a better yield than 
 four feet by four feet. He used a compost of pig ma- 
 nure and fence and head-land scrapings, and he had 
 it hauled out in February. When he wanted it well 
 turned over, he sprinkled a few grains of corn be 
 fore heaping. The pigs would bo sure to find them 
 and he knew m better shovel for the purpose than a 
 pig's nose. A shovel full of manure to each hill, 
 added about fltteen or twenty bushels per acre to the 
 crop. He does not use the cultivator because he is 
 satisfied that running it between the rows after the 
 corn is three feet high, lacerates the fibres, which 
 even thus early are sent oat from below and above 
 the ground's surface. In dry weather,and when the 
 corn is tasselling he runs the plough so as to throw 
 the earth toward the hills and over the roots. If 
 sufficient of the compost is not at hand, he obtains 
 charcoal dust from refineries, mixing one bushel of 
 it with two bushels of plaster, and a bushel of hen 
 manure. 

Mb. Go WES maintained that bad handling of the 
 cultivator was alone the cause of injury to the radi- 
 cles. In proper hands the hoe-harrow was unequal- 
 led for the purpose. Nor need it be run so close, or 
 so deep as to risk injury. To prefer the plough to 
 the cultivator he thought extraordinary. The latter 
 could be regulated to any depth greater than one 
 inch. It was impossible to plough as shallow as our 
 corn hoe. Correct principles taught that the plough 
 lacerates worse than was possible with the culti- 
 vator. 

Mr. Newton explained more particularly how he 
 would handle his plough so as to avoid the difficulty 
 apprehended by Mr. Gowen. 

Mr. a. S. Roberts had always ploughed in olden 
 times, but things had changed. Now Major Rey- 
 bold, of Delaware — good authority — in his contracts 
 with those he employed, always specified that no 
 plough should be used among his corn. 

Mr. S. G. Fisher inquired if any present had pro- 
 duced on poor land, one hundred and ten bushels to 
 the acre by means of Guano? That had been done by 
 Mr.Cassidy, of our city, the celebrated peach grow- 
 er. Mr. C. has raised seventy acres of corn, aver" 
 aging eighty bushels per acre. Ten of these, on 
 which 150 lbs. Guano per acre had been thrown 
 broadcast, and ploughed in, yielded 110 bushels of 
 shelled corn each. The height of the corn was also 
 extraordinary, it averaging eighteen feet. Mr. Fish- 
 er had tried the plough in the corn field ; so had his 
 neighbors, and all had abandoned its use, and adopt. 
 ed the cultivator. lie agreed fully with Mr. Gowen 
 on this subject. There were reasons for this prefer- 
 ence, based on the laws ef the vegetable economy, 
 let. The long roots, extending several feet, laterally 
 were cut by the plough, and the growth of the plant 
 checked. 2d. All roots require a certain distance 

below the level of the ground. If this be increased 
 or diminished, the plant is injured. The plough in 
 throwing its ridge over the roots, buries them deeper 
 than before, and they suffer in consequence. 3. Af- 
 ter they have become habituated to this state,they are 
 again uncovered by a second ploughing. Each time 
 the plant, in accommodating itself to the new con 
 dition, was checked. Corn requires but superficial 
 cultivation, and two inches were sufficient to kill the 
 weeds. 

Dr. Emerson regarded ihe corn crop as the basis 
 of our cultivation. He had heard much of Dickey's 
 corn drill, and wished to know if any membar pres" 
 ent had used it. The inventor had never raised less 
 than 100 to 113 bushels to the acre. 

Mr. Gowen suggested that thekind.of drill was of 
 secondary importance to the management of the 
 crops.

Guenon's System. High prices of Cows, 

At a recent sale of dairy cows, twenty-two in num- 
 ber, belonging to Henry D. Court, near West Ches- 
 ter, six averaged over §50 per head ; six over $40, 
 and the remainder, many of them not being fresh 
 till next fall, from §33 to $35 per head. They were 
 of what are called common stock, but had been se- 
 lected from droves chiefly, by Guenon's System, 
 and the result, as in many other cases in this vicini- 
 ty, proved its entire correctness, They had formed 
 part of a milk dairy, and averaged twenty quarts 
 per day for six months. Guenon's system is one of 
 the most valuable discoveries of the day to the farm 
 ing community, and when widely known throughout 
 our state, will produce in the aggregate an enormous 
 saving of expense, in rearing and keeping poor milk- 
 ers, and in time, an equally great increase of dairy 
 products. Since the appearance of our difi'erent ar- 
 ticles in the Farm Journal on this subject, there has, 
 been, and still continues to be applications at the 
 Agricultural Warehouse, in AVest Chester, from va- 
 rious parts of Pennsylvania, for the pamphlets of 
 Guenon & Neffliu, and so far as has been heard from, 
 the correctness of the system has been fully verified, 
 when closely studied and understood.
