Fw the Youni/ Jiotanists of Chester Cormtij, Pa., by 
 William Darlington, M. D., LL. D. 
 A new edition of tlie above invaluable work, is 
 just issued from the press, and is now on our table. 
 It is arranged according to the natural system, and 
 is one of the most complete compondiums of any lo- 
 cal Flora extant. Not only are all the indigenous 
 plants which have yet been discovered iu our coun- 
 ty enumerated and accurately described, but also 
 those which have become naturalized, and are culti- 
 vated for domestic purposes, the first being print- 
 ed in Roman, the second in Italics, and the last 
 in small capitals, so that the eye of the student 
 may embrace the whole at a glance. There is also 
 a glossary of Botanical Terms, a list of abbreviations, 
 ' a classified list of the naturalized and cultivated 
 planis, an index of orders, genera and species, with 
 synonyms and an index of English names, together 
 with a synopsis of the Liuuean arrangement of the 
 genera treated of, with references to the natural or- 
 ders to which they severally belong. Every thing ap- 
 pears to have been done, as regards simplicity of 
 elucidation.completeness of classification and descrip- 
 tion to make the work entirely acceptable to the 
 young Botanical Student, and the Agriculturist, as 
 well as the older and more experienced gleaner in 
 the fields of this delightful science. 

The work comprises a description of six hundred 
 and fifteen Genera, and thirteen hundred and ninety- 
 three species of plants of Chester county. Of these, 
 eleven hundred and four are indigenous, one hundred 
 and fifty-seven are naturalized, and a hundred and 
 thirty-two cultivated. Although intended to be en- 
 tirely complete, only so far as regards Chester coun- 
 ty plants, it embraces a large part of the Flora of 
 the middle States, and will be valuable to the gener- 
 al student. 

The present edition is also enriched with the ad- 
 dition of five discourses by the author, introductory 
 to a knowledge of the solence,and explanatory of the 
 leading features of the Linnean and natural systems. 
 To those who are apt to be Confounded with the tech- 
 nical terms and necessary scientific nomenclature of 
 Botany,so far as to be afraid to commence the study, 
 we would especially commend these preliminary 
 discourses. In the usual happy style of the author, 
 he has taken hold of and brought to view, the strong 
 points,i\iei important link, on which this science hin- 
 ges, and condensed them in a striking coup d'ccil the 
 most definite and comprehensive we have seen. They 
 seem to take one into the inner temple,and reduce to 
 a small compass the apparent mysteries of the great 
 groundwork often so formidable to beginners. The 
 work is neatly printed and handsomely got up in oc- 
 tavo form, of about six hundred pages, and accompan- 
 ied with a map of the county. It may be obtained at 
 the Agricultural Warehouse in this Borough, price 
 $2 00 We ostract the following excellent remarks 

from the preliminary discourses in the first part of 
 the work: 

A very natural preliminary inquiry, on the part 
 of a Pupil engaging in the study of Botany — or, in- 
 deed, in any other study — would be respecting the 
 utility, or value, of such an attainment ; and there- 
 fore — in order to encourage the young Beginner — it 
 may be well to hint at some of the inducements to 
 the undertaking. These may be considered in ref- 
 erence to mental discipline, intellectual gratification, 
 and practical usefulness. It is impossible for any 
 one, endowed with the common attributes of human- 
 ity, to avoid being something of a Katurali.it. One 
 of the earliest indications of Intellect, consists in 
 the perception, and discrimination, of the beings and 
 objects subjected to its cognizance. In proportion 
 as the mind is expanded, and its faculties disciplined, 
 so are its powers of discrimination augmented. Nat- 
 ural Science — or that knowledge which enables us 
 to ascertain, to distinguish, and to an ange, or classi- 
 fy created beings — is emphatically a science of obser- 
 vation; and no study has a happier tendency to in- 
 duce habits of attention, and accuracy in noticing 
 the characteristic features of objects. No one is 
 less likely to be misled by vulgar prejudices, or to 
 be made the dupe of imposture, than the careful ob- 
 server, and intelligent student, of Nature. Habitu- 
 al scrutiny renders him acute in detecting error,and 
 discovering truth, — while it makes him cautious in 
 receiving marvellous statements unsupported by cred- 
 ible testimony. 

While his faculties are thus improved by a saluta- 
 ry discipline, his taste is no less gratified by the 
 pleasures of the study: — and, of all the inanimate 
 products of creation, there is none more agreeable 
 to contemplate, than those which constitute the Ve- 
 getable Kingdom. Destined, by the wisdom of a 
 bountiful Providence, for the sustenance of a high- 
 er order of creatures, — they have, at the same time, 
 been admirably adapted to the purpose of adorning 
 the surface of the earth, and charging with fragrance' 
 the atm -sphere which surrounds it. Occupying an 
 intermediate position, between minerals and animals, 
 they afford us the means of investigating the won- 
 ders of organic life, without the infliction of torture, 
 or the necessity of witnessing the sufferings which 
 attend such researches in sensitive beings. Hence, 
 the study of the vegetable creation has over been a 
 favorite pursuit with gentle minds. There is a calm 
 delight in the contemplation of Plants and Flowers, 
 which is never felt — and can never be appreciated — 
 by those who find their chief gratification in the tur- 
 moils and commotions of the animal world. The 
 disposition of man derives much of its character 
 from association, and external impressions ; and it is, 
 doulitless, partly owing to the bland influences of a 
 rural life, that enlightened agricultural communities 
 are less prone to those cruel excesses, which so often 
 disturb the artificial and struggling society of crowd- 
 ed cities. If such be the tranquilizing tendency of 
 a simple residence among the Vegetable tribes, — how 
 propitious to the growth of the gentler virtues must 
 be the pursuits of the Botanist, who may ]ia said — 
 almost without a figure — to liold daily converse with 
 some of the loveliest works of the Creator, — and to 
 regard with something like the pleasure of a friendly 
 recognition, every Plant which he has successfully 
 investigated!* 

*No one ever heard a true lover of Botany complain of ttedium viiiu, 
 or of a want of pleasant employment for his leisure hours. His pur- 
 suits, it Is true, do not produce that vehement excitement which at. 
 tends the scrambling rivalry of political aspirants, and is so seductive
