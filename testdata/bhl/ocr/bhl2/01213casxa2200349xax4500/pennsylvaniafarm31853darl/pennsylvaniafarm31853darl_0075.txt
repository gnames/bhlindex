We know, indeed, that those grovelling mortals 
 who consider nothing as valuable, but mere tangible 
 wealth, are apt to regard the researches of the Nat- 
 uralist as useless and frivolous, — just as gross, un- 
 cultivated minds suppose all pleasures to consist in 
 sensual gratifications, ^d have no conception of such 
 a thing as intellectual enjoyment. It is the besetting 
 infirmity of sordid natures, to mistake the instrument 
 for the object ; to limit the aim, and confine the af- 
 fections, to the means of enhancing our character, as 
 rational beings — instead af employing those means 
 for the attainment of a nobler end. But, is it true, 
 that the studies of the Naturalist are useless and 
 frivolous? On the contrary, the most bigoted Utili- 
 tarian — on a moment's reflection — will be forced to 
 admit, that they are fraught with results of dailv, 
 and high practical vajue, in many of the most im- 
 portant pursuits. To the Agriculturist, the Garden- 
 er, the Physician, and the Artist, a correct — and 
 even scientific — knowledge of the Vegetable King- 
 dom is, to a certain extent, indispensable: — for, a 
 scientijic knowledge of plants merely implies an ac- 
 quaintance with their true character and properties,- 
 and that, every person whose business is witli plants, 
 is bound in honesty and good faith — as well as by 
 the requirements of self-interest — to possess. Such 
 knowledge is, of course, to be best obtained by means 
 ■of the must skillful, systematic, and facile method of 
 investigation ; or, in other words, by the help of a 
 truly scientific arranjement. 

The successful culture of Vegetable Products, re- 
 quires a knowledge of the character and habits of 
 the plants which yield them; and that knowledge — 
 80 far as it is possessed and applied — is»neither more 
 nor less than practical Botany. lie who is acquaint- 
 ed with the greatest number, and best understands 
 how to multiply the most valuable, is at once the best 
 Botanist, and the most accomplished Agriculturist 
 and Gardener. 

Is it not desirable, then, that wo should extend our 
 knowledge of the' useful Plants, — and learn to esti- 
 mate correctly, their true and relative values ? Is 
 it not necessary, also, that we should have a compe- 
 tent knowle-lge of the pernicious and worthless 
 Plants? But, to accomplish this, is to make a re- 
 spectable progress in tlie Science of Botany. Hence 
 I contend, that a certain portion of Botanical knowl- 
 edge is indispensable to. the Farmer who aspires to 
 excellence in his profession, — and who would aid in 
 elevating that profession to the rank which it is en- 
 titled to hold, among liuman pursuits. It is not ne- 
 cessary that he should prosecute the study in all its 
 extent; for that would be the business of a life-time: 
 But he ought to make himself acquainted with the 
 Vegetation of the region, or district, in which he re- 
 sides, — and he should understand well the character 

to the eager fancies of the crafty and ambitious; but the gratiftcationa 
 resulting from their culture— being foundeil on a consclousness'of their 
 value to our fellow creatures, as well as to ourselves— are of the most 
 precious and enduring character,- and are, moreover, wholly Indepen- 
 ■dent of vulgar taste or caprice. [See Sir H. Datt's Con.wlalifm& in 
 TVatirf.] 

The attractions of Botanical Science are truthfully and appropriately 
 alluded to, in the following extract of a letter from the late Sir .Tamks 
 Edward Smith to the Rev. Dr. Moulenberg,— il.ated London, March 
 *, 1793;— "You cannot be more enthusiastically fond of Botany than I 
 am; and your letter promises me afresh instance. In addition to many 
 already experienced, that this study — charming in itself— is still more 
 vatuable as a key to the intercourse of the iijost amiable minds. To 
 Botany I owe friendships and connexions I else could have had no 
 chance of forming; and j'our Letter, overtiowlifg with the mlllt of hu- 
 mati kindness, anl with the amiable -modesty of real merit, promiseg 
 me one which It will bo my most anxious care and ambition to de- 
 serve.'* 

of all those plants which immediately concern him, 
 as an Agriculturist. This is a duty by no means so 
 difficult as is generally supposed : And with the aid 
 now afforded by elementary and systematic writers 
 on the subject, the attainment is rendered as agreea- 
 bly interesting, to an intelligent mind, as it is profita- 
 ble in its practical results. The man who does not 
 know the more important plants liy which he is sur- 
 rounded — whose eye has not learnt to discriminate 
 their characters, — is deficient in one of the primary 
 qualifications of an enlightened cultivator of the 
 soil. In truth, it is mortifying to see a good practical 
 Farmer, or Gardener, ignorant of some of the very 
 plants which it most behoves him to know, — wasting 
 his time, and his enero;ies. in mis-directeJ efforts to 
 P'otect himself from the Vegetable pests which in- 
 vade his grounds. IM.any of our farms are already 
 over-run with worthless weeds, which are extremely 
 difficult to subdue; and we are menaced witli the in- 
 roads of others stilL more anno3'ing and pernicious: 
 Yet there are but few of our Agriculturists who are 
 able to identify these invaders, when they make their 
 appearance, — or who seem to be aware of the im- 
 portance of prompt and vigorous measures for their 
 extirpation.* 

WORK FOR THE MONTH. 

Farm. — The most profitable crop raised on the 
 Farm, Indian Corn, now requires special attention. 
 We are not favorable to too early planting; the second 
 week in the month, for this section, will answer bet- 
 ter than earlier. As a general rule, any crop which 
 starts well, and has a. vigorous, uninterrupted growth 
 till maturity, results better at last, than if checked; 
 or stunted, and barely kept alive, by unfavorable 
 changes of weather, as a late frost, &c. The corn 
 crop requires a warm sun. We have seen the young 
 leaves turn yellow, the effect of a late frost, and out- 
 stripped in growth by that later planted. If weath- 
 er is dry, soak seed before planting, and roll in plas- 
 ter. Some special manure should be applied to each 
 hill, to hasten the early growth. A compost of ash- 
 es, plaster, and rich mould, such as scrapings of 
 wood shed, soil from head-lands, &c., should be used, 
 or poudrette, which has been found excellent, in the 
 propcrrtion of a good handful to every two hills, drop- 
 ed and covered with the corn. Br.in, as recommen- 
 ded in JIarch mimljer of Farm Journal, affords a 
 valuable stimulant to the early growtli.

 Guano in Chester county, has been proyed to make a

*I have seen an excellent old Farmer zealously waging war upon the 
 fetid Chamomile (^fantU^ 0)/ida, DO) an<lcr the mistaken belief that 
 he was contending against that troublesome nuisance.the Ox-eye Daisy 
 <.Lcuranllujniim.vuio»rc, Lam.) Some years since, a distinguished ag- 
 ricultural gentlemen publi-.hed a series of es;).-!:. s, for the purpose of 
 rousing the farmcrSjto asimultaheous atttick upon what he supposed 
 to be the CuTiacla Thistle. It was soon dlscovereil, however, that the 
 plant which he hail in view, was the comparaUvely harmless Dipnaritt 
 svlrrMris, i/ill. or Wild Teasel : and yet the real Canada Thistle (Piryi- 
 um arximse, Scop.) was then actually Intro luced. and spreading a- 
 round him, unrecognized and unknown, either by himself or his neigh, 
 hors!
