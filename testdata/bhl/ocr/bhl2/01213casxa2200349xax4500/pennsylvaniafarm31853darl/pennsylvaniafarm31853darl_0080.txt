Milk — the fluid secreted by females of the class 
 mammalia, for the nourishment of their youn^ — is a 
 white, translucent, aqueous emulsion, the principal 
 components of vrhioh are the oily compounds called 
 butter, casein or curd, a species of sugar and certain 
 salts. 

Under the microscope milk appears as a transpa- 
 rent fluid, in which small white globules are diffus- 
 ed, of variable diameters, in the same milk, as well 
 as in that of different animals. "These globules col- 
 lect upon the surface of the milk, when allowed to 
 remain at rest.or stand, forming the substance known 
 as cream. Some have supposed these to be na- 
 ked globules of fatty matter; others consider that 
 they are surrounded by a distinct containing mem- 
 brane. The latter view is, in some degree, render- 
 ed probable from the circumstance that they do not 
 coalesce by standing, or when gently heated, nor does 
 ether directly dissolve them; but when acetic acid is 
 added to milk, it appears to dissolve the containing 
 caseous or albuminous membrane, and the globules 
 then coalesce into drops, which either readily takes 
 up. 

The specific gravity of milk varies; that of the 
 cow is generally about 1.030. As it is affected by 
 the presence of butter on the one hand, which di- 
 minishes, and the casein and salts on the other, which 
 increase its density, it is difficult to ascertain a mean, 
 or to form an estimate of its value by this means; all 
 lactometers are consequently fallible as indicators of 
 the value of milk. 

According to Berzelius, the specific gravity of 
 skimmed milk is 1.033, that of cream 1:024, consis- 
 ting as follows:

As respects quantity and quality of milk, there 
 exists a wide range, not only with regard to the yield 
 from cows of different breeds, but also from cows of 
 the same breed; the subject is still further complica- 
 ted, owing to diversities either in the quality or quan- 
 tity, or in both, caused by feeding on different va- 
 rieties of food; which are again liable to variation 
 with respect to the period of gestation at which the 
 milk has been collected. Rapid changes in its char- 
 acter occur preceding and immediately after partu- 
 rition. 

Lessaign examined milk at ten different periods, 
 four before and six after parturition. Tlie milk ex- 
 amined during the first three of the former periods, 
 namely, 42, 32, and 21 days before parturition, con- 
 tained no casein, but in place of it albumen; no su- 
 gar of milk and no lactic acid, but a sensible quan- 
 tity of uncombined soda. That examined eleven 
 days before and just after parturition, contained 
 both albumen and casein; while milk,eleven days be- 
 fore, and shortly after it, contained free lactic acid 
 and sugar of milk, but no free soda. The milks ex- 
 amined 4, 6, 20, 21, and 30 days after parturition, 
 contained casein and no albumen. 

A valuable series of experiments was instituted by 
 Dr. Playfair, for the purpose of ascertaining "the 
 changes in composition of the milk of a cow, accor- 
 ding to its exercise and food;" they are published in 
 the first volume of the "Transactions of the Chemi- 
 cal Society of London," in the course of which the 
 author expresses a regret, which all agriculturists 
 must participate in, "that the value of the experi- 
 ments is diminished by not being extended over a 
 series of days on each kind of food." "But in Eng- 
 land," the author adds, "where the price of ether is 
 so exorVjitantly high, the expense of such experi- 
 ments is a serious consideration for a private indi- 
 vidual." As these experiments are of the utmost 
 importance, as guides to sound concIu.sion respecting 
 the subject under investigation, the following extracts 
 are subjoined: 

The cow which was the subject of experiment was 
 of the Short-Horn breed, and the period that had 
 elapsed since calving unknown. When the experi- 
 ments were instituted she was in good milking con- 
 dition. In order to estimate the average amount of 
 milk, it was measured several days previous to the 
 experiments, during which time she subsisted upon 
 after-grass, the meadow being about half a mile dis- 
 tant from the cow-house.

The weather was fine for the period of the year, 
 but the nights being rather cold, directions were giv- 
 en that the cow should be driven to the house, and 
 remain there during the night. In the morning she 
 was put out to grass, but brought back in the even- 
 ing. On the evening of the 9th the analyses were 
 commenced,and were followed up for successive days. 
 In every case the specimen of milk analysed was 
 taken from the milk pail after the cow had been 
 thoroughly milked, and the milk well stirred. 

1st day. The cow fed in the meadow upon after- 
 grass during the day, was driven home to the cow- 
 house in the evening; the milk then obtained amonut- 
 ed to four quarts; specific gravity, 1.034.
