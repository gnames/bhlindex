 The fat in the food only amounted to 0.346 lbs., tliere- 
 fore 1.004 lbs. must have been obtained from other 
 sources.

The milk of the evening amounted to 13 J8 lbs., 
 and contained 0.006 lbs. of butter; that of the morn- 
 ing to 12.20 lbs., containing 0.597 lbs of butter. The 
 cow, therefore, furnished 1.203 lbs. of butter. The 
 fat in the food amounted only to 0.308 lbs.; hence 
 0.895 lbs. of butter must have been produced from 
 other sources. 

From the preceding calculations it is presumed 
 that the excess of butter, beyond that contained in 
 the food, has been produced by a sepi^ration of oxy- 
 gen from the elements of the unazotised ingredients 
 of the food, such as starch and sugar, in the manner 
 pointed out by Liebig. 

In the preceding experiment there are several va- 
 riations; this will ever be found the case where so 
 much depends upon the health and disposition of the 
 animal, over which man can possess little, if any 
 control; many circumstances may pass unheeded by 
 the observer, which may powerfully influence the 
 character of the milk. It will be seen that in the 
 milk of the first day there is a small amount of but- 
 ter. The cow had' been exposed in the field during 
 thei day, and hence required a gveater quantity of 
 unazotised food to support th? heat of her body than 
 ■would have been necessary had she been protected 
 from the cold; but in the evening she was removed 
 into a warm, well littered stall, where the warmth 
 thus communicated was equivalent to a certain a- 
 mount of food; hence we find that the milk of the 
 morning was considerably richer in butter. Besides 
 the warmth of the shod, less butter is consumed by 
 the oxygen of the air. In the stall, the respirations 
 of an animal are much less frequent than in the 
 field, and consequenly less oxygen enters into its 
 system. Hence it is a practice to milk those cows in 
 the field that are distant from homo, and to drive home 
 to be milked only such cows as are close to the shed. 
 The exercise required in walking home causes an 
 increased olay of the respiratory system, and there- 
 fore increases the amount of oxygen inhaled. This 
 oxygen unites with part of the butter and consumes 
 it; all good dairymen allow the cows to walk home at 
 their own pace, and never accelerate it. When a 
 cow is harrassed, and runs to escape from the an- 
 noyance, her milk becomes very much heated, di- 
 minishes in volume and in richness, and speedily 
 becomes sour. This is a fact well known to all dairy- 
 men. During runing; the cow inhales a large quan- 

tity of oxygen; this unites with the buttter, the heat 
 evolved by its combustion elevates the temperature of 
 the milk, and acetous fermentation being induced, 
 the milk thus becomes sensibly sour. 

The view here taken of the production of butter, 
 from the amylaceous and other unazotised portions 
 of the food, is supported by the increased amount of • 
 butter yielded, after being partially fed upon pota- 
 toes. The quantity of casein in the milk appears 
 also to be intimately connected with the nature of 
 the food, being more abundant when supplied with 
 beau and oat-meal; and would justify the conclusion 
 that within certain limits the quality of milk may 
 be made to vary in in its composition, by regulating 
 the food of the animal. 

As the preceding experiments may be looked upon 
 as being on too limited a scale to draw a just con- 
 clusion, I will here insert what was pointed out to me 
 as a remarkable instance in practical dairy manage- 
 ment, in the county of Chester, which is strongly 
 confirmatory of the previous vievis: — • 

It has been remarked in Cheshire, and I believe in 
 other extensive cheese districts, that it is impossible 
 to make cheese of the first quality from milk obtain- 
 ed from cows fed upon tares and clover; notwithstan- 
 ding which, I had pointed out to me a farm where 
 the whole of the cows were fed, almost exclusively 
 during the summer, on tares and clover, the entire 
 produce of which dairy was converted into cheese, 
 and that of a quality so excellent, that it always ob- 
 tained the highest price from the London dealers at 
 the Chester cheese fairs. The circumstance was re- 
 lated to me as an illustration of what could be ac- 
 complished by management, — the dairywoman be- 
 ing esteemed one of the best hands in that celebra- 
 ted cheese making county. My own conclusions 
 were, that mere manipulation had little to do with it. 
 The best cheese is a compound of cheese and butter. 
 When the cattle were fed at large on leguminous 
 food, rich in casein, that substance greatly prepon- 
 derated in the milk, the butter being partially con- 
 sumed by the animal in the course of the exercise 
 requisite to procure its food, &c.; when fed in the 
 house with the like food, the butter was necessarily 
 yielded in greater proportion, consequently formed a 
 rich fat cheese. In concluding these observations on 
 milk, it must be remarked, that the milk obtained 
 from different breeds varies greatly with respect to 
 the quantity of butter which it contains, and still 
 more with respect to the milk drawn from the cow at 
 the commencement, and near the conclusion of the 
 milking, the latter being provineially termed "strip- 
 pings," and "afterings." Schubler says that the 
 milk last drawn contains three times as much cream 
 as the first. Dr. Anderson found the cream in the 
 last cup of milk drawn from the udder, compared 
 with that of the first cup, in the proportion of 16 to 
 1; it is consequently of the greatest importance 
 that the cow should be milked perfectly "dry at 
 each meal." For another reason this ought to be 
 carefully attended to; when the larger vessels are 
 regularly emptied, milk is being constantly secreted 
 by the capillary milk vessels; when, however, from 
 any cause the whole are allowed to become gorged 
 for a lengthened period, this secretion ceases, and 
 absorption of the thinner, or watery portion com- 
 mences. It may easily bo conceived tliat this absorp- 
 tion takes place more readily in the smaller and 
 more distant tubes, than in the larger and more ex- 
 ternal vessels. If this full state of the vessels con- 
 tinues any length of time, the secretion of milk will 
 cease or diminish, not ^infrequently attended by se- 
 rious inflammation; materially impairing, or alto-
