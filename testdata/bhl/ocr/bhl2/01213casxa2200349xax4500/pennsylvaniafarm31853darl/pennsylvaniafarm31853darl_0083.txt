gether destroying, the function of the milk gland. 

In milking, the cow should be milked "clean" at 
 once; some are in the habit of doing this at twice or 
 thrice. The cow is a sensitive and capricious crea- 
 ture, easily oifended; and it the dairy maid rise from 
 her before the milk is all withdrawn, the chances are 
 that she will not stand quietly, with the further prob- 
 ability that she will hold back her milk the second 
 time. When there are more than one dairymaid, 
 each should have a particular set of cows apportion- 
 ed-to her; cows preferring to be milked by a constant 
 acquaintance rather than by a stranger. During the 
 flush of grass, when the cows are loaded with milk, 
 it may be well always to go round a second time, by 
 which means frequently a tea-cup full to half a pint 
 of milk can bo obtained. 

Milking should be done fast, to draw off the milk 
 as quickly as possible. From the period of drawing 
 the first milk trom the heifer, to the time she is in- 
 tended "to be put up," for the butcher, gentleness 
 and kindness should be exercised towards her. No 
 doubt some cows are very capricious and troublesome 
 — such ought to be sold, or sent to the slaughter- 
 house as soon as possible; if a cow can not be man- 
 aged with kindness, thumps and kicks will be found 
 of no avail. Some cows yield their milk with a co- 
 pious How on the gentlest handling, others require 
 great exertions. The udder of the former will have 
 a Soft skin, with short teats; that of the latter will 
 possess a thick skin, with long and tough teats. Be- 
 fore leaving this part of the subject it may be men- 
 tioned, that in some parts of Switzerland and France, 
 it is not an uncommon practice to spay milch cows 
 whilst in a full flow of milk, a short time after calv- 
 ing, by which means they continue in milk some 
 years. 

Celery. 

The production of good Celery is a point well 
 worthy the care of the gardener. Few vegetables 
 are more highly prized or require so much attention 
 from the time the seed is sown till it is furnished to 
 the table. The drouths of summer and the severe 
 frosts of winter are alike injurious to it; and to en- 
 sure a crop, the soil must be in the best condition. 
 Moisture is essential to its cultivation, and a supply 
 of well fermented manure or rich compost is one of 
 the first conditions towards success. An open, free, 
 loamy soil sutficiently rich in vegetable matter will 
 suit it. Stiif tenacious clay is to be avoided, as it 
 binds too much, and prevents the free developement 
 of the plant; such soil also induces canker, while free 
 sandy loam, with a sufficient supply of well decom- 
 posed manure, will raise it, free from this. As a 
 large quantity of manure must be supplied with the 
 crop to ensure its rapid growth it is not essential that 
 the soil should be previously very rich, its physical 
 condition is more important. In choosing a piece of 
 ground for Celery it is advisable to take into con- 
 sideration the nature of the crop that may follow, so 
 that the best advantage may bo taken of the high 
 cultivation generally applied to it. The ground 
 where good celery has been raised will be capable 
 of producing any crop requiring highly manured 
 soil, the following season. A very successful plan is 
 adopted by some gardeners to secure a shade for the 
 young plants; they plant a row of peas or corn be- 
 tween the trenches, which is taken off the ground 
 before the soil is requireil for earthing up. 

When the ground has been chosen, mark off a 
 space of five feet in width, and open a trench 
 eighteen inches wide, throwing out the surface 

soil a spade deeper, spreading it over the ground 
 equally. In the bottom of this trench deposit the 
 manure or compost. • Farm-yard manure, night soil, 
 bog pen manure, and other well decomposed mate- 
 rial, is the best for this vegetalde, which depends 
 for its perfection on quick and luxuriant growth. 
 This should be well incorporated with the soil and 
 reduced to a fine state for the reception of the plants. 
 Plant them in double rows in the trench at eight 
 inches from plant to plant, and about four inches be- 
 tween the rows; the plants should be alternate in the 
 rows. Care must be taken in removing the plants 
 not to reduce the roots too much, they may be remov- 
 ed without being checked by lifting them with a gar- 
 den trowel. The soil about the young plants should 
 be made as fine and mellow as possible. The middle 
 of July is quite soon enough to plant out the gener- 
 al crop of Celery in this climate; they cannot endure 
 a much longer suramcr,and by planting earlier noth- 
 ing is gained. The soil must be frequently stirred 
 to keep down weeds and admit the air. It is not ad- 
 visable to earth up until tlie plants have attained^ a 
 good size; as they do not keep well during the win- 
 ter when, they are earthed up too soon in the season. 
 Very good Celery is grown and blanched without 
 earthing, until the final covering is put on for the 
 winter. Such as is not required for use until the 
 latter part of the seas(jn may be safely treated^ in 
 this way, as it will be sufficiently blanched by being 
 covered during winter. A portion for immediate 
 use must be earthed up as soon as tlie plants attain a 
 heighth of six or eight inches. This operation must 
 be carefully managed, taking care to keep the soil 
 from getting into the heart of the plant. The most 
 certain method is to fold the leaves closely together 
 with one hand, while the soil is drawn up around 
 them with the other. 

The first earthing is the most important. If this is 
 properly attended to, the succeeding ones are not so 
 likely to be mismanaged. The five feet space is used 
 for the purpose of covering up for the winter. Where 
 such a space is left, it is not necessary to remove the 
 plants from the trench, as is sometimes done; but they 
 may be covered up as they stand. The great danger 
 is from rotting when covered up in this way, and to 
 prevent this the soil must be made so compact as to 
 prevent any water from entering. In a very severe 
 season, boards are placed over the ridges. When 
 the stalks are removed from the trench they are 
 placed on the ground upright, and banked up with 
 dry soil to a sufficient depth to exclude the frost, and 
 covered with straw or boards. If covered when dry 
 they are not likely to rot, and are well blanched by 
 the latter end of winter. That portion of the orop 
 for early use may be scoured in a sparato trench, . 
 may be deposited in a dark part of tho collar. 

There are only two or throe varieties of Celery cul- 
 tivated ti any extent in this vicinity, of which Sey- 
 mour's White Solid is the mo.st useful. The Red 
 Solid is cultivated to some extent, but is not found 
 so suitable as the White, and is not so much used 
 now as fiirmerly. There is a great difference in the 
 quality of seed depending upon the stock from which 
 it is grown. It is a seed which disappoints many 
 persons in not germinating readily; a hod sown ono- 
 week may come up freely, while another sown tho 
 following, from the same package, and on sinxilap 
 soil, may disappoint. Moisture in the soil is iwpur-. 
 taut. — [New York Agricultor.
