Beurre d'Aremberg. 

The above engraving is n. correct outline of one 
 of our very best Winter Pears.very productive,ripens 
 readily, and grows finely on both Pear and Quince. 
 It is sometimes confounded with Glout Morcoau, 
 which it resembles in the color of bark. This latter, 
 however, has a sugary flavor, while the Beurre d'- 
 Aremberg is of the sub acid or vinous character, and 
 with leaves more deeply serrated. It is a Belgian 
 variety, obovate, narrowing to the stalk; skin thick, 
 greenish yelIow,yellow at maturity, with spots of rus- 
 set; stalk short, half to one inch long, thick and 
 fleshy towards insertion, oalys small, in a deep ba- 
 sin. Flesh buttery, melting with a rich vinous or 
 sub acid flavor. Ripe in December and January. 

The New RocUelle Blackberry. 

"The Secretary reminded tlie Chair that Mr. Law- 
 ton, of New IvDchelle, Westchester county was pres- 
 ent, and he was the gentleman who exhibited a re- 
 markable stalk of a blackberry, which was then on 
 the table: wiiereupou the Chair requested Mr. Law- 
 ton to give the Club some information regarding 
 this remarkable new variety of fruit, 

'■Mr. Lawton stated that one of his neighbors dis- 
 covered, some sis or eight years ago, a bunch of 
 blackberry vines, by the side of the road, of differ- 
 ent quality from the common high blackberries, and 
 go much superior that he was induced to transfer 
 them to his garden. Prom this small beginning they 
 have been propagated as m'lch as possible. Mr. 

L. first obtained them in 1848; it is his intention 
 to set ten acres as soon as he can get the plants. He 
 stated that the stalk exhibited had been headed back, 
 so that it resembled a bush four and a half feet high, 
 with a spreading head, which he presumed from his 
 knowledge of the general yield, had borne a gallon 
 of fruit. 

"The charactei' of these berries is very unlike the 
 fruit of the common high blackberry vines, which is so 
 long and full of seeds, while the new variety is near- 
 ly round, very pulpy, the pipe being large, in which 
 the seed are entirely hid from view. lie stated that 
 he had measured many berries that were three inch- 
 es round; that the general size and shape were as 
 near like Ilovoy's seedling strawberries, as anything 
 he could compare them to. The flavor of the fruit 
 is sweet and rich, to a remarkable degree, and vines 
 long bearing. His first crop ripened July 28th, and 
 continued till the second week of September. The 
 next, August 4th, and continued four weeks. Last 
 summer, owing to the great drouth, they only con- 
 tinued about three weeks in full bearing. The vines 
 grew almost equally as well in shade as in open 
 ground; and if an opportunity is given, will climb 
 twenty feet into a tree. 

"Mr. Lawton sold his berries last summer to a 
 New York dealer for ten cents a basket — equal to 
 about twenty-five cents a quart — the buyer picking 
 them himself. It is the opinion of Mr. Lawton, that 
 this is an entirely new variety of the blackberry; and 
 besides the greater value of the frnit, they bear gar- 
 den culture much better than the other, or common 
 variety. The demand for new plants is greater than 
 can be suppled at pi-esent moderate rates — the price 
 now being fifty cents." — [Agricultor. — New York
