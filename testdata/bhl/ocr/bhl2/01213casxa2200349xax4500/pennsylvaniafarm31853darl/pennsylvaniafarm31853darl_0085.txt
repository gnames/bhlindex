JAPAN LILIES. 

Japan Iiilies. 

The Lily, from time immemorial, has been the 
 theme of the poet, and the subject of sweet allusion 
 hy men of taste and learning: frequently and beau- 
 tifully is it referred to in the scriptures, for its ex- 
 quisite fragrance and loveliness, and for magnificence, 
 Divine authority has declared "that Solomon, in all 
 his glory vras not arrayed like one of these." 

It is not my purpose, at present, to enquire wheth- 
 er the species or variety thus sublimely spoken of, 
 was the Lilly op the Vallev, belonging to the ge- 
 nus Convallaria, as some have supposed; the LUitim 
 candidum, of Pliny, or the splendid tribe with which 
 this chapter is introduced to the notice of your read- 
 ers. 

Of the many remarkable plants imported into 
 Europe, within the last half century, few can claim 
 such pre-eminence for beauty as the Lilies discover- 
 ed by Dr. Von Siebold, during his researches in Ja- 
 pan, in the years 1831 to 1833; and it is no exag- 
 geration to state, that none have since been intro- 
 duced, more deservedly popular, or more highly at- 
 tractive. 

Dr. Von Siebold informs us, in his Flora Japoiika, 
 that he brought with him from Japan, more than 20 
 kinds of Lilies, the most conspicious of which, how- 
 ever, are tlie Lilium speciosum, (sometimes called 
 r!/&™»t,)the £. lancifoUum allntm, and the L. Ian- 
 cifotium punctatum or roseum. All these have ro- 
 flexed petals, and may be briefly described as follows: 
 LILIUM SPECIOSUM. 

Shoiri/ Crimson Japan LiUeij. — Flower, ground 
 color, clear rose, shading to white, covered with nu- 
 merous projections of bright crimson, and wliich 
 gives it the appearance, as Dr. Lindley remarks, of 
 being "all rugged, with rubies and garnets and crys- 
 tal points." a plant of two to three feet in bight. 
 LILIUM LANCIFOLIUM ALBUM. 

White Lanre-leaved Lihj. — Flower, pure virgin 
 white, crested with the same peculiar projections as I 

the former species, but these are without color, and 
 which may be compared to frost work and snowy 
 stalactites; grows to the height of three or four feet. 

LILIUM LANCIFOLIUM PUNCTATUM, OR 
 ROSEUM. 

Spotted Lance-leaved Lily. — Flower large, white; 
 the petals stubbed with palo rose or blush projec- 
 tions and beautifully spotted with rose-color: The 
 plant is of more robust habit than cither of the sorts 
 named above, often attaining to the height of four or 
 five feet. 

The virgin whiteness of the albnm, the roseate 
 leopard-like spotting of the jyiinctatum, and the jew- 
 el-like brilliancy of the speciosum, all redolent with 
 the fragrance of Arabian spices, will ever render 
 these, objects of especial favor and admiration, and 
 place them among the very choicest plants of the 
 conservatory, or flower garden. 

Soil. — In oultiv.ating these new Lilies, the follow- 
 ing soil will be thoroughly adapted: two parts from 
 an old hot bed, composed of leaves and horse ma- 
 nure, at least two years old; one pai-t rotten sods, or 
 any good mellow loam; one part sandy peat; (if not 
 sandy it will be well to add a little sand.) 

PoTTIXG AND SniFTINO THE BuLBS. — .A.bout the 

middle of January, these will commence vegetating, 
 when they should bo potted in small pots, repotting 
 or shifting them to a larger size every two months, 
 or as often as the pnts are filled with roots — always 
 remembering that perfect drainage, and plenty of it, 
 are indispensable to success. 

Proi'aoatio.v. — By seeds, which are obtained in 
 abundance in this climate, if the pistils areferlilizod. 
 These should be sown as soon as ripe, in shallow 
 pans, in which they may remain for one or two 
 years; they should then bo transferred to six inch 
 pots.^ur to six bulbs around the edges of the same 
 — and finally, singly, in pots for flowering. 

By Off .Sets and liv Goi'xo BfLns: — These are 
 formed at the crown of the old bulb, and also at the
