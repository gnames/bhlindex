ment for the service of the Woods and Forests, and 
 that the first parcel has already arrived. Should all 
 . this quantity vegetate no fevrer than 16,000,000 plants 
 will have heen acquired, and thus we may expect 
 the hills of Groat Britain to be speedily clothed with 
 the sacred Cedar of the Brahmins; or making every 
 allowance for deteriorated seeds, the produce to be 
 raised must neeessai-ily be prodigious. The charge 
 of rearing it having been confided to four eminent 
 nurserymen — Messrs. Glendinning,of Chiswick; Law- 
 son, of Eilinliuvgh, Skirving, of Liverpool, and Wat- 
 erer, of Knap-hill — we have security for the crop 
 being skilfully managed, which no one would have 
 guaranteed if the seed had been placed in the hands 
 of the present Deputy Surveyors of the Royal For- 
 ests. 

Government will thus become possessed of a very 
 large quimtity of a fast-growing tree, the value of 
 which cannot be over-rated, whether it is regarded 
 as a nurse, most useful for protection, and profitable 
 for thinning, or, according to the testimony of those 
 who are familiar with it in India, strong and dura- 
 ble as timbei-. 

We apprehend that no hardy tree yet known has 
 the same high value as the Deodar, as a nurse. The 
 Scotch Pine is so heavy and compact in its fjliage 
 that it keeps light off the deciduous trees which 
 grow among it, and offers great obstruction to the 
 free circulation of air, doing about as much harm in 
 this way as it effects good by giving shelter from 
 heavy gales. Its poles too are so bad that it must 
 always bear a very low price in the timber mark t. 
 Larch, which is a far better nurse, because its light 
 airy foliage and pyramidal form offers no hindrance 
 to the action of light and the free circulation of air, 
 and whose poles usually fetch a good price, has the 
 fault of being destitute of leaves in the early spring, 
 and is, moreover, subject to the mysterious and in- 
 curable "rot." On the other hand the Deodar com- 
 bines the graceful form and rapid growth of the 
 Larch, with the evergreen character of the Scotch 
 Pino, witliout the faults of that species, and we have 
 every evidence of every observer who has seen it in 
 India, that its timber is of excellent quality. As that 
 is a very material point, and since we have occa- 
 sionally he.ard it suggested that because the Deodar 
 is nearly related to the Cedar of Lebanon, its timber 
 will probably partake of the bad quality of the lat- 
 ter, it seems worth while quoting the opinions of 
 those who are personally acquainted with it. That 
 no inference can be legitimately drawn from the sup- 
 posed relationship of it to the Cedar of Lebanon is 
 sufficiently shown by the Scotch Pine and the Pinas- 
 ter. They also are nearly related: and yet the old 
 timber of the first has great durability and strength, 
 while the latter is at all ages worthless for any pur- 
 pose except fire-wood. A similar but more striking 
 contrast is offered by the Pinaster and Pinus hispau- 
 ica, species surely more nearly allied than the Deo- 
 dar and Cedar of Lelianon. Now we have the evi- 
 dence of Captain Widdrington that the latter was 
 largely used in the Spanish n.avy for deck-planking, 
 a purpose to which Pinaster timber could never be 
 applied. 

The positive testimony of Indian travellers seems 
 conclusive as to the durability and excellence of De- 
 odar timber. Baron Cliarles V. Ilugol, now Austri- 
 an Minister at Florence, a good judge of such mat- 
 ters, saw tlie tree in abundance, and he calls it "the 
 incorruptible Himalayan Cedar, the invaluable Deo- 
 dar." Major Madden, than whom no one has more 
 carefully investigated tlio history of Himalayan Con- 
 ifers on their native mountains, quotes this very ex- 

pression of V. Ilugel, and evidently assents to it; he 
 even thinks it worth inquiry whether it really repela 
 the white ant, which seems to be a Himalayan no- 
 tion. 

Moororoft— and there never was a more trust- 
 worthy reporter — in the first volume of his travels, 
 makes use of the following language. "The most 
 valuable tree of Kashmere is, however, the Deodar, 
 a variety^of Cedar, the timber of which is extensive- 
 ly employed in the construction of houses, temples, 
 and bridges." And he adds, that pieces of it had 
 been found little decayed, although exposed to the 
 action of water for 400 years. 

We have, moreover, the high authority of Dr. 
 Boyle, who long resided in the Deodar countries, that 
 the timber is of excellent qu.ality, and of great 
 strength as well as durability. It is universally em- 
 ployed in the building of temples, in which none but 
 the best materials would be employed. The mode of 
 using it is to construct a solid frame work of the 
 timber, and then to fill in the spaces between with 
 stones, so that the main strengtli uf the building is 
 made to depend upon the Deodar, rather than the 
 masonry. Thus used, it is exposed to a trial which 
 nothing but timber of the best qu.ality could support. 
 This is in complete accordance with all that we have 
 ever heard of the quality of Deodar wood; and must 
 be regarded as conclusive. 

The only subject of doubt in our minds as to the 
 issue of the great undertaking now described is 
 whether the gentleman to whom the young Deodars 
 will be finally intrusted, after they shall have been 
 delivered up to Government by the nurserymen who 
 are to rear them, will know either where, or when, 
 or how they ought tobeplanted.-[Gardeners' Chron-

Osier or Bjisket Willow. 

As considerable attention has lately been directed 
 in the United States, to the cultivation of the Basket 
 Willow, we copy the following short article respect- 
 ing its culture, and management in England, from a 
 lato number of the London Gardener's Chronicle. 

More than twenty varieties are alluded to, but the 
 most profitable, we believe, is considered to be the 
 Salix Viminalis Linn, which is valued especially for 
 its ample produce of very long, strait, slender,tough 
 and flexible branches, and when allowed to grow, 
 forms a tree from ten to twenty feet in height. It 
 has leaves, linear or lanceolate, obscurely crenate, 
 white and silky beneath; stipules very small, sub- 
 lanceolate, ovaries almost sessile. Flowers in April 
 or May, befores the leaves come out. 

Osiers are adapted to low wet patches of 
 ground, whore scarcely any other crop can he adven- 
 tured. They are largely grown in ILdland, in Spain, 
 and some other countries of Europe; and in England, 
 are perhaps most plentiful in the fiat portion of L.au- 
 c.ashirc, where grounds of 00 or TO acres each are 
 not unusual, and are fiund also in the Great Level 
 of the Fens. The land must be so situated that water 
 cannot stand upon the surface fir more than a few 
 days at a time in summer; in « inter, two or three 
 months' flooding will be no disadvantage. Parallel 
 grips or water-trenches should be dug about three 
 feet apart; the earth thrown out raises the soil aiid 
 improves the drainage. Sets about two feet long, 
 are then planted by licing thrust half-way into the
