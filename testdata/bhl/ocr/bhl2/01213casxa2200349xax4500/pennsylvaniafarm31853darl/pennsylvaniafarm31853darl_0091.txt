STRAWBERRIES. 

52. Walker's Seedling. — Fair size, darli red, fine 
 flavor; productive. P. 

53. . California Pine. — Moderate size, scarlet, same 
 form and flavor as the old Hudson, productive, p. 

54. Mexican Alpine. — Found by the writer on one 
 of the loftiest volcanic mountains of Mexico; foliage 
 resembles the Alpine varieties of Europe, and very 
 distinct from all other. American species, fruit scar- 
 let, and of moderate size. 

*55. Amanda. — Short conical, light scarlet, juicy, 
 good flavor, productive, p. 

*56: Heroine. — Good size, light scarlet, conical, 
 fine flavor, productive. P. 

*57. Psyche. — Large, conical, scarlet, beautiful.ex- 
 oellent flavor, very productive, p. 

*58. Troubadour. — Large, elongated cone, crimson, 
 good flavor, productive, p. 

*5y. Vietorine. — Large, scarlet, fine flavor, very 
 productive, late flovcering, estimable, p. 

*60. Imperial Scarlet. — Large, light scarlet, excel- 
 lent flavor, and will probably prove one of the most 
 estimable. It fruited for the second time the past 
 summer, p. 

*61. Prince's Climax. — A very hardy and robust 
 variety, surpassing almost every other in the vigor 
 of its growth and its large foliage. The fruit is 
 borne on strong stems, and excels all others in aver- 
 age size without any small Vjerries. It is of the 
 most beautiful light scarlet color, and the best suited 
 of the varieties for a splendid market fruit. The 
 flavor is very pleasant,but not equal to Le Baron and 
 other highest flavored varieties. It is a pistillate, 
 and exceedingly productive, and presents the most 
 admirable display of fruit we have ever beheld, p. 

02. Large Early Scarlet, or Early Virginia, is so 
 well known that it may seem unnecessary to describe 
 it. The fruit is of secondary size, light scarlet, and 
 of pleasant flavor, and it produces one-third to one- 
 half of a full crop. It has served very generally as 
 a fertilizer, resulting oftener from circumstance than 
 from choice. Its blossoms expand too early for im- 
 pregnation of the numerous later varieties, and on 
 this account "ie Baron," is much preferable as well 
 as for its larger and finer fruit and the abundance 
 of its crops, and for an early flowering f ertilzer the 
 "Triianjih" is much to be preferred. 

63. Bicton Pine. — Large, white tinged with pink, 
 good flavor, moderate bearer, only valuable for its 
 color. 

64. British Queen. — A very large and splendid 
 fruit, and of fine flavor, but utterly worthless for its 
 unproductiveness in our climate, unless great pains 
 are taken in its culture. A bushel may be grown 
 from other varieties more easily than a quarter from 
 this. A pistillate variety from this one would be 
 very valuable, as its sexuality would remedy the 
 barrenness of the parent. 

65. Princess Royal. — Large, dark scarlet, conical, 
 good flavor, ripens late, poor bearer. 

66. Elton Pine. — A large and splendid fruit, fine 
 flavor, ripens late, a poor bearer; but this and the 
 preceding will produce some admirable fruit, if es- 
 pecial pains are given to strengthen the soil, and 
 to detach all the runners. 

67 to 71. Myall's Black Bock, Eleanor, Globe, 
 Mammoth and Prolific, are English Hermaphro- 
 dite varieties, mostly of good flavor, but poor bear- 
 ers in our climate, and their foliage is very subject to 
 be burnt by our powerful sun. The Mammoth, 
 though large, is of miserable flavor. 

72. Goliath (Kitley's.) — It has been much laud- 
 ed, but is now denounced in English pulication 
 i;s "a shy bearer aud insipid in flavor." 

73. Hautbois. — This ancient European species is 
 remarkable for the musk flavor uf its fruit, and for 
 the barreness of its seminal varieties. The Prolific 
 ane JMrge Flat Hautbois produce tolerable crops. 
 The Green Hantbois is more an object of curiosity. 

The light English hermaphrodite varieties fmra 
 No. 63 to 71, commencing with the Bicton Pine, I do 
 not think worthy of culture, except by such fancy 
 amateurs as are willing to waste much time and cul- 
 ture for small returns. Very many persons have 
 never seen a full crop of strawberries as pi-oduced 
 by pistillate plants, and therefore think much of a 
 partial one. Tliey should cultivate some of thepis- 
 tillates noted as "very productive," and then decide 
 understandingly. I have passed over the English 
 Wood and Alpine Strawberries, as they are so well 
 known to every cultivator. 

The following varieties are of little comparative 
 value on account of their unproductiveness, or of the 
 inferior quality of their fruit, and have consequent- 
 ly been superseded, as well as forty other varieties as 
 published in our catalogues: 

Aberdeen Bee-hive; Alice Maud, (Princess;) Black 
 Prince;* Buist's Prize; Burr's Seedling; Burr's Late 
 Prolific; Burr's Mammoth; Burr's Profusion; Burr's 
 Scioto ; Cremont Perpetual ; Gushing ; Downton ; 
 Duke of Kent; Dundee, (synonym:) Fay's Seedling; 
 French Cucumber; Keen's Seedling; Knevett's Pine; 
 Lord Spencer; Myatt's Eliza; Myatt's Deptford Pine; 
 Necked Pine, (Ohio:) Old Pine; Prince Albert; Prince 
 of Orleans; Richardson's Early; Richardson's Late; 
 Richardson's Cambridge; Roseberry; Royal Pine; 
 Royal Scarlet; Swainstone; Willey, or Willey's Seed- 
 ling. 

A Sm.vll Select Assortment — When consider- 
 ing the characters of so great a number of varieties, 
 each of which is valuable for some property or oth- 
 er, and all of which constitute a selection from the 
 mass that have for years been passing in review, it 
 is difficult to designate so small a number as six va- 
 rieties that shall combine all we desire. However, 
 I will^vcnture so far as to select six for market, and 
 six for a family garden, such as I would prefer, if 
 confined absolutely to that small number: 

Six varieties for market — 1. Le Baron — productive- 
 ness, and excellent flavor. 2. McAroy's Superior — 
 productiveness, beauty and flavor. 3. Cormicopia — 
 productiveness, beauty and flavor. 4. Triumph. — 
 Earliness, beauty and productiveness. 5. Hovey's 
 Seedling — great size and productiveness. 6. Pri- 
 mate — productiveness, beauty and firmness. 

Six varieties for a family garden. — No. 1, 2 and 3 
 of the precding list. 4. Superlative — productiveness, 
 flavor and color. 5. Coronation — size, beauty and 
 flavor. 6. Syljihide — size, beauty and flavor. 

I have purposely omitted Prince's Climax and the 
 Imperial Scarlet, as they are not procurable, not hav- 
 ing yet been offered for sale.— [Horticulturist. 

Peach Worm. 

This great enemy to Peach growing, after de- 
 stroying whole orchards, which would otherwise 
 be long lived and profitable, is fortunately within 
 our control. His operations commence at or just 
 below the surface of the ground, as m.ay easily be 
 detected by the presence of gum. All that is neces- 
 sary is, to bare the neck or collar of the tree, in the
