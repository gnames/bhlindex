Correspondents for the Farm Journal. 

We believe that in Pennsylvania are as good 
 Farms and Farmers, as valuable improved stock, 
 some of the very best agricultural implements, as 
 successful combinations of science and practice in 
 cultivation, as can be found in any other State in the 
 Union, but there seems to exist a most unaccounta- 
 ble reluctancD to extend and promulrjcde through the 
 medium of the press, their experience and informa- 
 tion, for the benefit of their brother farmers. Com- 
 pared with New York and New England, the con- 
 trast is most striking. There, a farmer who practises 
 a successful system or rotation, raises an extraordi- 
 nary crop, or by judicious and skillful crossing, im- 
 proves his stock, considers it a kind of duty to pro- 
 mulgate it through an agricultural paper for the gen- 
 eral benefit. It is not so here, but it ought to be. It 
 should be considered one, and that not the least of 
 the duties owing to society, not to hide our light un- 
 der a bushel, but to contribute our mite, whether 
 small or large, to the aggregate good. We hope to 
 make the Farm Journal the medium, through which 
 intelligence and information on all agricultural mat- 
 ters in Pennsylvania, is to be distributed. It is the 
 only strictly Agricultural and Horticultural periodi- 
 cal in the State, and its pages are at the service of 
 all, willing and disposed to contribute information. 
 They can be filled, if our farmers so wish it, with 
 choice and select valuable and practical matter for 
 other States and countries, accompanied with such 
 editorial remarks and suggestions, as we consider ap- 
 plicable to our own section, but we greatly prefer 
 original communications from Pennsylvania Farm- 
 ers. We do not care for high flown sentiment, and 
 well turned periods, and merely theoretical abstrac- 
 tions. What we want axe facts, experiments, results; 
 plain facts, plainly given. These are really valua- 
 ble to us and our Journal, and we can but consider 
 it the dull/ of the Farmers in this State, to cultivate 
 more the habit of disseminating their agricultural 
 knowledge and experience, by writing for the papers. 
 We will welcome their contributions with pleasure, 
 and in this way more than any other, can the Farm 
 Journal bo made creditabte to, and worthy of Penn- 
 sylvania. We are disposed to do all we can, but no 
 editor or dozen editors, can do what can only be done 
 by practical farmers themselves, variously situated, 
 as regards soil, climate, or other circumstances. 

Since the Journal has come into our hands, our 
 list of subscribers has been receiving (Jonstant acces- 
 sions. Within three or four weeks we have had an 
 increase of nearly two hundred new ones, from the 
 State of Delaware alone, which shows it is being ap- 
 preciated in that quarter, and that hor farmers are 
 awake to the spirit of improvement. This always 
 creates a demand for agricultural reading, as it is al- 
 so a necessary result of it. 

We want 10,000 subscribers in Pennsylvania du- 

ring the present, and before the commencement of 
 the next volume. With thanks to friends in various 
 sections of the State, who have forwarded us clubs, 
 we hope they will not relax their efforts. 

Tlie Strawberry (Question. 

We have received from Thomas Meehan, Philsr 
 delphia,a letter in reference to the criticism by W. R. 
 Prince, in our last number, on his essay, read before 
 the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. The letter 
 was accompanied with a specimen of a strawberry 
 plant, "McAvoy's red," with two scapes from one root, 
 having one pistillate, and the other staminate, blos- 
 soms, each of them what would be called well devel- 
 oped. We have something to say on this hackeney- 
 ed subject ourselves, but shall await another time, 
 till the paper bullets, we hear are in preparation are 
 discharged. We observe!. Meehan's essay has made 
 quite a stir among our friends, the Cinoinnatians who 
 have gone into regular conclave on it, and passed a 
 formal resolution, after long discussion, "that this 
 Society hold that experience has only confirmed 
 their previously established opinions as to the per- 
 manent character of a pistillate strawberry, as given 
 to the world in their report of 1846." There is 
 a sensitiveness in the "Queen city" about this 
 "strawberry question" so long a mooted one. We 
 shall say no more now, than to express the opinion, 
 that notwithstanding the above resolution, the straw- 
 berries will continue to blossom as they ever have 
 done. More anon. 

Agricultural College. 

The New York Legislature, the day before its ad- 
 journment, passed the bill incorporating the New 
 York State Agricultural College. The plan of in- 
 struction embraces practical and scientific agricul- 
 ture, chemistry, mechanics, mathematics, surveying, 
 engineering, geology, botany, the practical manage- 
 ment of the farm, of the dairy, and farm stock. 

We clip the above from one of our exchanges. An 
 act something similar, embracing a plan of an Agri- 
 cultural College for Pennsylvania, was before our 
 Legislature, but we cannot learn that it passed into 
 a law, or by what species of maneuvering it was 
 omitted. Perhaps some of our readers can inform 
 us. The farmers of the State, and indeed the whole 
 people are interested, and it is their due that the 
 particulars should be known, who voted for or against 
 it, or who failed to call it up. There seems to be 
 less difficulty in appropriating the money of the peo- 
 ple, than in passing laws of this character, calcula- 
 ted to increase the means of paying, and which tend 
 directly to the general benefit, and are actually re- 
 quired by the example of States north and south of 
 us. We hope it will still be persevered in at the 
 next Session.
