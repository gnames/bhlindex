Calystegia Pubesceus. 

Under the title of "the new and charming Chinese 
 Climber," the above pl.ant has been very largely dis- 
 tributed, from certain sections, and a pretty round 
 speculation has been made out of it. We know of 
 places in Pennsylvania, where it was received through 
 the mall first, at the very moderate price of fifty cents 
 per tuber, and afterwards as it was found easy of 
 propagation, it was sent as presents, to induce pur- 
 chases of other articles. 
 In the November No. of the Farm Journal, we wrote 
 an editorial about this weed, cautioning the public, 
 and advising all traces of it to be carefully hunted 
 out, emptied on the brush heap, and burned. We re- 
 fer to it again now, as a friend of ours and a careful 
 farmer, informs us it has spread through his ground 
 in a most alarming manner, and would appear to be 
 worse than daisy or even Canada thistle. Ho has 
 found it two feet under ground, and thousands, in 
 every direction, all growing in a short time from one 
 or two plants. Calystegia belongs to convulvulacea, 
 and like convolvulus arvcnsis, that pest of English 
 farming, is especially to be dreaded. Let no time 
 be lost in its extirpation. 

Analysis of Professor Mapes' SuperpUoshate of 
 time. 

We observe an analysis of this article has been 
 made by Professor Johnson, of Yale Colioge, who 
 says it is composed of 
 37 lbs. plaster, (sulphate of lime.) 
 21 lbs. insoluble phosphate. 
 15 lbs. superphosphate of lime. 
 5 lbs. free sulphuric acid. 
 2J lbs. ammonia. 
 The other twenty pounds are water, sand, &c. 

Northumberlaud County. 

A friend at Turbntville, Northumberland county, 
 in sending us a list of new subscribers, winds up his 
 interesting epistle in the following strain: 

"We, in this county, may justly boast, of possess- 
 ing one of the best and most beautiful poi-tions of 
 the earth. Our limestone township is (not inappro- 
 priately) denominated Paradise. And we ii ive good 
 old Adam and Eve* still living in it. I do njt mean 
 that patriarclial pair who lived in the garden of Eden; 
 but a venerable couple of about three score and ten, 
 who are surrounded by a numerous progeny which, 
 like themselves, seem to enjoy to their hearts con- 
 tent the bounties of L>ivine Providence. We have a 
 healthful climate, a superior soil, a profusion of lime- 
 stone, and an enterprising population. Nothing 
 seems wanting but to reduce Agriculture to a sci- 
 ence, and to enlighten the community therewith, in 
 order to make us prosperous and happy."

Sale of Durham Stock. 

Col. Sherwood's sale of about thirty thorough bred 
 short-horned cattle, twenty of them cows and heifers, 
 the remainder young liulls, will take place at Au- 
 burn, New York, on the 8th of June, at one o'clock, 
 P. M. These animals have been bred with care from 
 the best blood in England, and are well worthy of 
 attention. Several of them are from "Yorkshire- 
 man," imported by Joseph Cope, Chester c0Unty,Pa. 

The State Fair. 

Our State Agricultural Exhibition and Cattle Show 
 which is to be held in Pittsburg on the 27th, 28th, 
 29th and 30th days of September next, should not 
 be lost sight of by the farmers, horticulturists, me- 
 chanics, manufaetures and artizans of Pennsylva- 
 nia. The time is already at hand when exhibitors 
 should be making those preparations which they 
 cannot in justice to themselves dispense with, prior 
 to bringing before the public gaze those articles and 
 animals which they wish to enter in competition with 
 the many competitors on occasions of this kind. — 
 There is, however, plenty of time yet left to enable 
 every one who wishes to get up something for the fair. 
 The premium list which is very extensive and which 
 ofiers more and higher premiums than was ofiered 
 by the Society last year will soon be ready for pub- 
 lication. 

Premiums will be ofiered to competitors without 
 the State,and encouragement given by handsome re- 
 wards for prize articles in all branches of industry, 
 with the hope that they may be all represented. 

I desire to say to the farmers and others of the 
 western counties of the State, to not hesitate making 
 preparations for competing at this exhibition because 
 it is to be held in their midst. It is expected that 
 those who are convenient will have the most to ex- 
 hibit. Do not think that because it is a State exhi- 
 bition that you, who have been in the habit of com- 
 peting in county fairs, will be outdone, and that there 
 iB no chance for you to succeed. Let no farmer say 
 — it will be no use for me to come in as an exhibitor, 
 and that the prizes will all bo borne off by those who 
 C(Jme from ajar. Let me say to you that the citizens of 
 Dauphin county, at the first exhibition, and the cit- 
 izens of Lancaster county at the second, fell into this 
 error,and did not contribute as they could have done. 
 After the fairs were over I heard farmers of those 
 counties regret their want of confidence in what they 
 Jiad to exhibit — one said he could have taken such a 
 premium, and another that he could have beaten 
 such a production, and another that he could have 
 beaten such an animal, if be had only known what 
 was on exhibition before he left home. 

Let no one for a moment suppose that he or she 
 caunot be benefitted by preparing something for tlio 
 Fair,but conclude that it is tlie aggregate zeal of all, 
 that gives life, and enarg\-, and spirit to tlie lumora- 
 blo and valuable competition of an agricultural ox-
