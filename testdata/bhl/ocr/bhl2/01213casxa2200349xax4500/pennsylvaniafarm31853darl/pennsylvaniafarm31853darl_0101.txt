south, with a passage way two feet wide by three 
 feet high, for the older fowls to go to the roosts and 
 nests, from an open shed east of this building: cast 
 of this shod, on the same line, there are three other 
 chicken houses ten feet square, one story high, with 
 glass windows on the south side"- all the houses have 
 separate yards, joining to a grass lot shaded with 
 trees: the fowls enjoy the luxury of this lot alternate- 
 ly, the short time given them is very industriously 
 employed in eating the grass, no time being allowed 
 them to tread it down; by this arrangement a small 
 lot is rendered equal to a large one. 

North of this range of buildings is a Duck yard 
 and house, the lower part for ducks, and the upper 
 for chickens, and an artificial Pond, supplied with 
 water, by means of a pipe inserted into a wooden 
 pump, sis inches below the nozzle, that when the 
 pump is used, a portion of the water runs into the 
 pond, as well as distributes fresh water along the 
 lino, into the several chicken yards. In the duck 
 yard are two kettles, holding about fifty gallons, cov- 
 ered with a shod, to boil feed in, for the ducks and 
 chickens: all those buildings I have found indispen- 
 sable in breeding the chickens distinctly, and with- 
 out mingling. My first experiments in hatching by 
 artificial means, was with an Eccaleobion, about four 
 feet long, two feet high, and two feet deep front to 
 back legs, twenty inches high, with tour drawers, 
 four inches deep, and two feet square, placed near to 
 one end; the drawers encompassed with a copper case, 
 containing a sheet of water, three inches thick, con- 
 necting with a large body two feet each way, through 
 which a small iron stove passes to heat the water. 
 In the top drawer are two openings, one front and 
 one back, with valves connected by a small iron shaft 
 with the front valve, where is inserted a glass tube 
 with a bulb at each end, nearly filled with mercury, 
 so regulated, that when too warm or too cool,the mer- 
 cury will expand or contract, throwing the weight 
 from one end of the valve to the other, opening or 
 closing it, as required; this self regulator of the heat 
 in the drawers, removed the necessity of so close at- 
 tention to the fire. This mode will hatch the eggs 
 by keeping the heat in the drawers bHween 98° and 
 104° Frahrenheit. My next experiment was, to pile 
 bricks around the stove in place of water; I found 
 the HEAT would pass around the drawers as well as 
 the WATER, and keep a uniform heat that would hatch 
 eggs equally well, but attended with more persoxal 
 CARE. I next experimented with horse dung as a 
 means of generating heat, which has resulted in 
 perfect success, in producing fine healthy chickens in 
 twenty-one days from the commencement of their 
 heating. This mode will be more useful to the far- 
 mers, as they have the material at hand, and would 
 cost nothing but a little labor to accomplish the 
 hatching of eggs to any extent. This mammel (to 
 use the Egyptian name,) I will now give a minute 
 description of that every farmer may build one for 

himself, and be aisle to perfect the hatching of eggs, 
 and rearing of chickens without the aid of the hen. 

The mammel is a building thirteen feet by sixteen 
 feet, with a tight grooved partition dividing it into 
 two apartments, the front one seven feet, the other 
 nine. In this partition are two openings to receive 
 the front ends of the ovens. These ovens are six and 
 a half feet long, two feet two inches wide, nineteen 
 inches high on one side, and eighteen inches on the 
 other in the clear, the back end closed, and made 
 entirely of inch boards; lined with tin, soldered wat- 
 er tight, with shutters in two equal parts, hung to 
 the bottom and in the middle with hinges, two but- 
 tons to close the front end. In the upper part of the 
 shutter there are two sliding valves, each four inch- 
 es by six, to give air, and regulate the heat. The 
 outside of the ovens and the partitions should be 
 well coated over with pitch to exclude moisture, and 
 preserve the wood from decay. The ovens should 
 be placed eighteen inches above the ground, support- 
 ed with posts, at the back end, and four feet apart, 
 with an open board partition, the boards running up 
 and down ten inches apart, to divide the dung be- 
 tween the ovens, and yet not entirely separate, that 
 in renewing the dung of one oven, the others may 
 not be chilled. There should be a window in the 
 back, to give air and receive the dung through: the 
 dung should be such as is made in a well littered 
 ho;se stable, and used straw and dung mixed and 
 well watered, while being thrown into a pile, where 
 it is to remain twenty-four hours, to soak, and admit 
 the redundant water to pass off; it should be placed 
 loosely around the ovens, which will not require re- 
 newing for two weeks; then renew only half of the 
 length of the oven at a time, judging from the heat 
 when more of it is to be renewed, which will be re- 
 quired about every two weeks. Tan will make a 
 very good bed under the ovens in place of the dung; 
 the heat will last longer. The egg box four feet 
 long, two feet wide, three inches deep, lined with 
 baize; ten inches of one end covered with wire to 
 keep in the chickens that are just hatched — the other 
 part of the box should have a light frame with twine 
 placed between the eggs and attached to the frame, 
 to turn all the eggs at one move. The egg box rests 
 on a carriage which runs on rails laid on the bottom 
 of the oven, with a moveable attachment to run the 
 carriage entirely out of the oven; the egg box turns 
 on a centre, to reverse the ends in the oven. 

The carriage is made in two parts, the lower part 
 has grooved wooden pullies let into it, to roll on the 
 rails, the upper part is connected to the lower with 
 small bars of iron, about eight inches long, with 
 holes for a wood screw in each end, and the screws 
 put into the top and bottom, where they lay together; 
 which moves like a paralol ruler; and confined to 
 diifcrent heights by a hook, about ten inches long, 
 fast to the upper part, and hooks into staples, driven 
 into a piece of wood fastened to the lower part; this
