arrangement is to sustain the egg box at different 
 heights to suit the required degree of heat, wliioh I 
 have found to be, as near as it can be kept, to one 
 hundred degrees from the first, to the last stage. 
 The egg box should be moved out of the oven in the 
 morning and towards evening, to avoid a strong light, 
 and only twice a day, with as little noise as possible, 
 to insure successful hatching. 

My feed room can be made perfectly dark; 
 through one of the doors is a hole one and a quarter 
 inches in diameter, over which is a piece of cloth, an 
 inch hole in it, that an egg will exclude all the light 
 except what passes through it, when in four days can 
 be seen the first progress of the chick, which, if not 
 visible, boil it for the young brood. 

Next in order is the rearing the chickens without 
 the aid of the hen. In the basement of the first 
 named building, on a level with the top of the Eeca- 
 leobion, is a platform four feet by seven, with a slide, 
 to open in fine weather iuto a small yard, also, one 
 to open into a small wire front box, over the Ecealeo- 
 bion which is moderately heated from a small stove; 
 in this box is an artificial mother, made of rabbit 
 skins, hung about two inches from the bottom; 
 where the chicks are first placed; in three or four 
 days they are let into the next adjoining apartment, 
 where there is a sheep skin mother. Over this apart- 
 ment is another with a sheep skin raised higher at one 
 end than the other, for the chickens further advanc- 
 ed, (to run under.) In the glass building, is a plat- 
 form sixteen feet by four, about four feet above the 
 ground floor for chickens still further advanced, 
 (with a yard to it,) they .ire next shut out from this 
 apartment, and run with the full grown fowls. All 
 these apartments will accommodate about five hun- 
 dred chickens of the diScrent ages. This mode of 
 hatching and rearing chickens is attended with not 
 half the loss that usually takes place, when hatched 
 and reared by the hen. 

With regard to feeding, the first meal, I give 
 grated stale wheat bread, laid on a sanded floor, 
 next I give bread boiled in milk, and while hot, mix 
 coarse ground Indian meal, making it nearly dry; 
 for the older fowls, I give wheat screenings and 
 whole corn, once a week boiled moat. 

It will here be seen, that I have made the manage- 
 ment of eggs, as plain and simple as Captain Cooke, 
 "standing one on its point."

Wheat, third in rotation, is suited to the soil, and 
 when it escapes the effects of disease, insects, &o., 
 is profitable; some plough but once, but it is becom- 
 ing more customary to plough twice, being more 
 likely to insure a good stand of grasses, where this 
 is done; plough deep, immediately after oats har- 
 vest, harrow once, then haul and spread 20 to 25 ox- 
 cart loads barn-yard manure, per acre, ploughing 
 this under (directly preceding sowing,)with a shallow 
 furrow; mark out in six pace lands, sow, harrow 
 twice, sow four to six quarts timothy seed, pJileum 
 prateiise, and roll it in, or cover it with the last har- 
 rowing; when drilled, which is practised to a consid- 
 erable extent, harrow twice after ploughing, and sow 
 grass seed immediately before or after the drill; time 
 of seeding, from the 10th to the 25th of 9th month, 
 (September;) of harvesting from the 1st to the 15th of 
 7th month, (July,) cut whei the heads begin to 
 droop; if clear of grass, bound directly after the cra- 
 dle, stood in open stock for 2-1 hours, then hauled 
 in; when necessary to shock against rain, let 2 hands 
 take ten sheaves, place 6 of these in a double row, 1 
 at each end of these, press them into a small com- 
 pass at top, move the bands of the 2 remaining 
 sheaves (which should be large ones) nearer the 
 butts, let these be raised perpendicular at the sides 
 of the shock, spreading the head at the same time, 
 and while one person clasps both, let the other 
 bind them together. Wheat well put up in this way, 
 will withstand any ordinary rain. 

Seed. Numerous varieties have been, and are at 
 present in use. Rock, a white wheat, yield of straw 
 good, but grain too small to produce a fine crop; 
 abandoned. Prime samples of White wheat, from 
 Maryland and Genessee, N. Y., have been tried and 
 proved failures. "Jones," "Hershy," White wheats, 
 "Blue Stem," and "Red Chaff Bearded," produce 
 fair crops at times, but are subject to the rust and 
 fly. The Mediterranean, owing to its comparative 
 exemption from these, having a stiffer straw, and ar- 
 riving earlier at maturity, is coming into general fa- 
 vor. This crop is subject to the ravages of the Hes- 
 sian fly, winter killing and rust. notice writers 
 of various sections recommend late sowing to escape 
 the Hessian fly. Experience with us has caused the 
 date of sowing to become much earlier than used to 
 be customary. Late sowing may avoid the fly in 
 the fall, but the plants will be weak, exposed in 
 consequence, more greatly to the vicissitudes of the 
 winter, and if the fly appears in the spring, will be 
 a very fit subject for it; it will also tend to retard its 
 maturity, thereby rendering it more liable to be 
 caught by rust. Varieties that mature early will be 
 more likely to escape the latter; winter killing may 
 mostly be avoided by freeing the ground from sur- 
 plus moisture. There has also appeared within the
