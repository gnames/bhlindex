shade with boards, laid on sticks, across the trench 
 till growth is established. Earth up in a dry time as 
 the plants continue growing, and avoid covering the 
 heart, repeating it every two weeks, till sufficiently 
 blanched. 

Cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, squashes, okra, 
 peas, and corn may still be planted. Set out sweet 
 potato sprouts in rows, four feet apart, in rich light 
 soil; and keep clear of weeds till vines .cover the 
 ground. A small quantity of turnip seed should be 
 sown this month for early autumn use. 

Plant out balance of tomato, egg plants, and pep- 
 pers, also pot and other herbs from seed bed. 

Herbs for drying should be gathered, ns they are 
 beginning to come into flower, and laid in the shade, 
 so as to dry gradually. 

Flower Gardex. — Continue the directions given 
 last month. Mow grass plots, and follow with the 
 roller. Secure the young shoots of roses and flower- 
 ing plants, to stakes or main branches to prevent be- 
 ing broken with the wind. This gives them a good 
 shape, and they will flower better for it. Iloe and 
 rake flower beds and walks frequently. It adds 
 much to the appearance of a flower garden. Trans- 
 plant annuals in damp weather, and sow again for 
 late blooming. Green-house plants generally may 
 be planted out this month. Continue to plant dahlias. 
 Drive a strong stake down firmly beside each one, 
 and secure it safely to prevent being broken with the 
 wind. Tuberoses and gladiolus, may still be planted. 
 Tulips and hyacinths are improved by being lifted 
 once in two or three years, and replanted in fresh 
 soil, or the old one enriched, observing after lifting 
 to stow away in a dry airy place, and plant again in 
 the fall. Bulbs should be lifted when the tops have 
 decayed.
