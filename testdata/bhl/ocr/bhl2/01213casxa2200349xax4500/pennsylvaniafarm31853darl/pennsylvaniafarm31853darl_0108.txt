AD INTERIM REPORT. 

Philadelphia, May 17, 1853. 

To the Prcskhnt fiflJie Pennsylvania IlorticuUural Society: 

The fruit Committee respectfully submit, as usual, 
 an ad interim Report on the specimens of Fruits sub- 
 mitted to their examination since the, last meeting of 
 the Society: 

From Cliarles Kesaler, of Itcading, Pa.: — ThePfiif- 
 fcr Apple — noticed and described in the Report for 
 April, but not then sufficiently mature for testing, 
 has since been examined,and is regarded as of "good" 
 quality. 

From John Gorgas, of Delaware: — The Freeze 
 and Thaw Apple — grown on the farm of his father, 
 Roxbury township, Philadelphia county, Pennsylv.a- 
 nia. Size medium ; conical ; profusely striped" and 
 mottled with liright red on a yellow ground, with a 
 number of light dots, and frequently one or more 
 white splashes near the base ; stem three-fourths of 
 an inch long, slender, inserted in a wide, deep, acu- 
 minate cavity, partially russeted ; calyx small, clo- 
 sed, set in a moderately wide, superficial, wrinkled 
 basin; flesh of fine texture, but deficient in flavor, 
 and on that account can scarcely be considered of 
 "good" quality, if the specimens were cut at the prop- 
 er time. Mr. Gorgas informs us that it may be left 
 on the tree till it repeatedly freezes and thaws, with- 
 out sustaining injury: hence the name. 

From Cliarles Kessler, of Reading : — A Red A]> 
 ple — below medium size, which origin.ated on the 
 premises of Mr. Ilains, of Pricetown, Berks county, 
 Pennsylvania. Form roundish oblate ; skin thin, 
 striped and marbled witli bright i-ed, and marked 
 with numerous whitish dots near the crown ; stem 
 long, rather slender, inserted in an open, deep cavi- 
 ty ; calyx large, set in a wide, rather deep, slightly 
 plaited basin; the bright red stripes remain imprint- 
 ed on the fruit after the delicate skin has baen re- 
 moved ; the coloring matter penetrating and partial- 
 ly staining the otherwhise whitish flesh, which is ex- 
 ceedingly tender and of fine texture; flavor agreea- 
 ble ; quality "ir;// good". 

From Charles Kessler, of Reading: — The SpecJcled 
 Oley—hom Oley township, Berks county, Pennsyl- 
 vania. This Apple is s»id to be beautiful when in 
 perfection, and usually one-third larger than the spe- 
 cimens sent to us. Size two and a half inches by 
 two and five-eights; roundish; stripe 1 and mottled 
 with red on a greenish yellow ground, and thickly 
 covered with large white dots, most of which contain 
 a russet speck in the centre ; stem three-eighths of an 
 inch long, by one-tenth thick, inserted in a very nar- 
 row, acute cavity, sometimes russeted; calyx small, 
 set in a shall nx, furrowed basin ; seed long and of 
 a light yellowish brown color ; flesh rather dry and 
 meaily, but with a pleasant flavor ; being over-ripe, 
 an accurate judgment could not be formed of its 
 quality. 

From Charles Kessler, of Reading : — A large green- 
 ish yellow Apple, with a faint brown cheek ; round- 
 ish, inclining to conical, and somewhat angular; 
 stem short, rather stout, and fleshy at its junction 
 with the branch; cavity acute, narrow; russeted in 
 rays; calyx small; basin moderately deep, not wide, 

furrowed; flesh tender, juicy; as the specimens were 
 over-ripe, the quality could not be accurately ascer- 
 tained. 

From Charles Kessler, of Reading: — Newtoxvn Pip- 
 |«'«— from Berks county; largi^; roundish oblong, 
 greenish yellow, with faint broad stripes of red on 
 the side exposed to the sun. Not true to name, and 
 not equal in quality to the genuine Newtown Pip- 
 pin. 

^From Mr. Slingluff. — Beautiful specimens of pears, 
 from a tree purchased for the Catillac, but which 
 proves to be Uccdale's St. Germain. The latter is 
 distinguished from the former in being pyriform; 
 while the Catillac is broadly turbinate. Both are 
 valuable only f )r culinary purposes, and one of them 
 (Uvedale's St. Germain) is familiar to us under the 
 name of Pound Pear. 

From Jonathan C. lialdwin, of Downingioum. — 
 Pears lal)elled Si. Germain; which we regard as not 
 •rue to name. They were not in good condition 
 when received, and we were consequently unable to 
 test their quality. Mr. Baldwin, however, who is a 
 distinguislied pomologist, has expressed so favorable 
 an opinion of the variety, that we have drawn up the 
 following description of it, from the specimen he sent 
 us: large; obovate pyriform; greenish yellow, with 
 a brownish red check; stem an inch lung by one- 
 sixth thick, inserted without depression; calyx set 
 in a deep, narrow, sometimes wide basin: seed very 
 large; flesh yellowish white, juicy; specimens not in 
 a condition for us to determine the flavor and qual- 
 ity. 

From Dr. Berlolet, of Oley township, Berks coun- 
 ty. Pa., through Charles Kessler, of Reading. — The 
 Boas Apiple, which was introduced into Oley, about 
 fifty years ago, by the Rev. Mr. Boas, of Reading, 
 from Exeter township, where it is known as the A'el- 
 ter: medium size; roundish oblate; deep crimson in 
 stripes of difierent hues, with one or more whitish 
 yellow blotches near the base, sometimes only faint- 
 ly striped with red on a greenish yellow ground; 
 stem very short and thick, inserted in a moderately 
 deep, not very wide cavity; calyx set in a plaited b.a- 
 sin variable in size and form, sometimes superficial 
 and wide, sometimes rather deep and narrow; core 
 small; seed very small, plump, acuminate, greyish 
 brown; flesh yellowish white, crisp; flavor pleasant; 
 quality "very good." Said to be a long keeper. 

Six resident members were elected. On motion 
 adjourned.

Chester County Horticultural Society. 

The display of the Horticultural Societt, on 
 Saturday, the 1-lth of May, was very good, with a 
 fuller attendance than usual. Tlie display of green- 
 house plants by Morris & Co., and by llartman & 
 Co., exhibited much skill in culture and taste in se- 
 lection — they were much admired. The display of 
 tulips by Miss Bennett and Jlr. Stroraberg, in the 
 form of bouquets, were very brilliant. The follow- 
 ing display of Aitles shows that with a little care 
 we can have a supply of that valuable fruit the whole 
 year: — Joshua Enibrec exhibited 17 varieties, J. C. 
 Baldwin 7, Hartman & Co. 6, John James, -Jr., 4, 
 Ziba Darlington 8, .John F. Ingram 1, a seedling of 
 good keeping qualities and good flavor. Rhubarb 
 by P. Morris & Co., Jona,than C.Baldwin, and John 
 F. Ingram. Messrs. Morris & Co., exhibited a good 
 display of vegetables. This department was not so 
 fully represented as it should have been. 

Ih'omiums were awarded—
