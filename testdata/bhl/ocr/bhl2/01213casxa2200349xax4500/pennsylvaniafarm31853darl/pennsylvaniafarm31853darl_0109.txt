The following were appointed a committee to su- 
 perintend the June exhibition, viz: 

J. Laooy Darlington, E. B. Taylor, Wilmer "Wor- 
 thington, Jr., J. II. Bell, and A. Marshall; also the 
 following ladies: Miss Sarah W. Ilaines, Miss C. M. 
 AVilliamson, Miss Sarah E. Rutter, Miss C. L. Dar- 
 lington, and Miss Hetty Trimble. 

Mr. Elliot Cresson, of Philadelphia, wag duly 
 elected a life member. 

Mr. Cresson being present, made some practical 
 and useful suggestions before the Society. 

On motion the committee were instructed to re- 
 quest Mr. Cresson to deliver an address at the June 
 exhibition. 

New Corn Planter. 

Measures to secure a patent for the above have 
 been taken by Gardner A. Bruce, of Mechanicsburg; 
 111. In this machine, directly behind each furrow 
 share, is placed a hopper, and directly underneath 
 the bottoms of the two hoppers is a 'dropping slide.' 
 extending entirely across the frame, and which has 
 a reciprocating motion given to it by a lever. In the 
 bottom of each hopper are two holes, and each end 
 of the dropping slide has the same, there is likewise 
 through each side piece of the frame a vertical a]i- 
 erture. When the furrow has been prepared for the 
 seed, the droping slide is operated by a hand lever, 
 so thit one of the holes with which it is perforated 
 coincides with another in the side frame, whilst the 
 other hole is directly under one of the apertures in 
 the hopper. In this position a seed drops from the 
 slide through the frame, and into the furrow, whilst, 
 at the same time, a seed is forced from the hopper in- 
 to the other hole of the slide. The certainty of this 
 process is insured by having, in each hopper, a bal- 
 ance beam, to both ends of which are attached ver- 
 tical rods, which alternately serve to force a seed 
 from the hopper into the dropping slide; this plan 
 preventing the holes from being clogged, as the rods 
 will clear them. There are two covering shares on 
 each side of the frame, which are attached to a beam 
 moving in sockets, and the tendency that the shares 
 have to be thrown back, is checked by fixing a slot- 
 ted lever to the beam, and placing in the slot a cross- 
 piece, whose upward motion is determined by a pin, 
 so that the shares are regulated at will, and when 
 necessary they can be made to clear the earth entire- 
 ly. — [Scientific American. 

given by the Editor three or four years ago. These 
 directions are the only ones that I have seen that 
 strike directly at the root of the matter — that is to 
 say, by pi eventing the borer in a winged state, the 
 last of Slay and the first of June, from depositiiir/ its 
 eggs in the bark of the tree, and thereby laying the 
 foundation of a new brood. The old mode of killing 
 the borers by pushing wires into their holes in the 
 trunk of the tree, is good as far as it goes — but it 
 only goes half way. Since, if you succeed in killing 
 all the grubs in that tree, a fresh set may fly over 
 from your neighbors' trees, as soon as the grubs hatch 
 out, and lay their eggs in yours. The plan recom- 
 mended by the Editor of the Horticulturist, does the 
 whole business ; as many new subscribers whose 
 trees may be infected, have not that prescription at 
 hand, I shall beg leave to repeat it. 

First, kill all the grubs in the trunk of the tree, 
 by pushing a wire up the holes as far as possible. 
 Then take a pail — fill it half full of thin soft soap, 
 and stir in enough tobacco water to make it two- thirds 
 full. Having first scraped off any loose bark, next 
 apply this tobacco and soap paint with a stiff brush, 
 to every part of the trunk, and larger part of the 
 limbs — putting it on especially thick at the "crotch- 
 es," and the base of the trunk — the places where the 
 borer likes best to deposit its eggs. If this is done 
 early in May, I can answer from experience for its 
 efficacy." No borer will deposit her eggs in bark coat- 
 ed over in this way. — [Horticulturist. 

Apple Tree Borers. 
 In New England there is no greater pest to the 
 cultivator, tbau the apple tree borer. In some parts 
 it has destroyed whole orchards. Many persons, in 
 fact most persons, fidd their hands in despair, and 
 let the trees die. I have done better by the help of 
 the Horticulturist — having profited by the directions 

tlST OF PATENT CLAIMS 

Issued from the United States Patent Office. 

WiNNOWEKS. — By G. P. S. Zimmerman, of Charles- 
 town, Va. — I claim the invention, use, and applica- 
 tion of the perforated vibrating table, arranged to 
 a sloping liottom or platform, the parallel saw-like 
 stripes or straw pushers, combined with an oscilla- 
 ting rake and straw beaters or curved prongs, the 
 whole combined and working with the oscillating 
 hinged standard, and suspending straps, substantial- 
 ly as set forth. 

I do not, however, claim the invention of a com- 
 bined threshing, separating,aud winnowing machine, 
 but only such parts as are set forth. 

WiN'NowERs OF Grain. — By S. Briggs & J. G. 
 Talbot, of Sloansville, N. Y. — We claim causing the 
 upper sieve or riddle to viberate at a greater speed 
 than the screens, as set forth. 

Breaking Hemp. — By Lewis W. Colver, of Louis- 
 ville, Ky. — -I claim the combination of the oscillating 
 beaters, and the spring bars placed ajjovo and below 
 the beaters, so that the recoil of the springs after Ow 
 beater leaves the bars, shall shake out the hemp Sw. 
 clear it of its woody portions, as described. 

Seed Planters. — By Isaac II. Garretson, of Clay 
 Iowa — I claim planting corn in check ro.vs, by the 
 planting sides, worked on the cross-bar by hand, in 
 the manner set forth. , 

Grain Harvesters. — By T. D. Burrall, of Gene- 
 va, N. Y. — I claim first, the additional apron, to con- 
 vert the usual rear discharge into a side discharge of 
 the cut grain, constructed and arranged as sot forth . 

Second, the combination of the curved supports 
 and the adjustable journal box piece, to preserve the 
 relative positions of the cogs in the mitre gearing, 
 and at the same time allow of raising and depress- 
 ing the driving wheel, the gearing, &c., being con- 
 structed and arranged as described.
