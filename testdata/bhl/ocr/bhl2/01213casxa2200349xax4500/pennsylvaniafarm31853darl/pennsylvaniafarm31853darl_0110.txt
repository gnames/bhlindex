Harness — By James Stanbrough, of Newark, N. 
 Y. I claim the forming of rounds, raises, or rolls, on 
 the different parts of a harness or other leather work, 
 by doubling and stitching together a strap of leath-

Scythe Fastenings — By Alpheus Kimble, of Fitch- 
 burg, Mass. I claim the method of securing the 
 blade of the scythe to the snath, by passing its shank 
 through the end of the stationary metal cap, and se- 
 curing it by means of the upward presure of the

Breaking and Dressing Flax — By S. A. Clemans, 
 of Springfield, Mass. I do not claim simply the dou- 
 ble action of beaters, as that is well known in a great 
 variety of machines for various purposes. 

What I claim is the method of breaking and dress- 
 ing flax or other fibrous substances, by a beater con- 
 structed in the manner described, (vibrating on a cen- 
 tral axis,) between the faces of which the flax, &c., 
 passes as described, when this is combined with one 
 or two pairs of rests placed in close proximity to 
 the edges of the beaters betwsen which the flax pass- 
 es, as specified. 

Also, in combination with the beater and rests for 
 breaking and dressing, as described, the employment 
 of a pair of rollers each of which is grooved in the 

direction of its periphery, and one of which is made 
 to vibrate in the direction of its axis, for the purpose 
 of opening and softening the fibres, as described. 

Machines for Dressing SniNOLES^By Joel Tifia-

 with the connecting rods, and cam, for the purpose 
 of operating the arms, as described, turning and re- 
 moving shingles, at the same time, from one side of 
 a reciprocating bed, to the other, and then, when its 
 second face is dressed, throwing it from the machine 
 in a finished state. 

Plows — By Solomon Horney, Jr., of Richmond, 
 Ind.: I claim constructing the shank hollow in a 
 single piece, with two closed ends, as described, and 
 securing the same to and with the share and beam, 
 by means of the master bolts, and the short bolt for 
 passing through the slot in the top end of the hol- 
 low shank, for varying the position of the shank 
 with the beam, and for giving additional security to 
 the fastening of the same, as set forth. 

Smut Machines — By H. L. Fulton, of Chicago, 111: 
 I am aware that a flat plate on the side of the con- 
 cave has been used; this, therefore, I do not claim; 
 but I claim the circular, prismatic shaped brace and 
 concentrator, arranged between each pair of revol- 
 ving scouring pl.ates, and secured fast to the inner 
 periphery of the case for the purpose of concentra- 
 ting the grain,and throwing it upon the second scour- 
 ing plate, and thereby preventing its escape, before 
 it is effectually cleaned from the first scouring 
 plate, directly to the discharged passage, as descrilJ- 
 ed. Also, in combination with the revolving dish 
 shapened plates, or beaters, substantially as describ- 
 ed, the prismatic ring, for the purpose of concentra- 
 ting and directing the grain from one beater to the 
 other as described. 

Shingle Machines — By Simon Ingersoll, of Xew 
 York city: I claim the spring clipper, operated as de- 
 scribed, in combination with the riving knife, for the

 dres.sing knives, by the next advance of th; driver, 
 as set forth. 

Caterpillars. 

We have long been anxious to ascertain what bird, 
 if any, would destroy the common caterpillar. In a 
 conversation with J. G. Bell, Esq., Ornithologist and 
 Taxidermist, v^e learn that the Bait. Oriole,(/rf(>Ms Bal- 
 timoHus) will destroy many hundreds per day. This 
 bird removes the head, takes out the semi-fluid por- 
 tion, leaving the hairy case. The Orchard Oriole, 
 {Iciirus Sjmrivs) of Audubon, is also a very destruc- 
 tive bird to caterpillars. 

Mr. Bell stated that the Downy Woodpecker, {Pic- 
 (us Puhescens,) and the Hairy Woodpecker, (Picus 
 Villosus) are useful birds to the farmer, as they des- 
 troy myriads of the grub or borer in the apple tree. 
 They generally take them out of young trees near the 
 ground. 

Mr. Bell has promised, at some future day, to fur- 
 nish us with an article on Ornithology as connected 
 with agriculture. 

We hope our young friends who parade the country 
 in shooting jackets, will reflect before shooting any 
 of the birds we have named above, that he is destroy- 
 ing an individual of, probably, ten times his own im- 
 portance to the body politic— JE':r(.'7ian()'e.
