It is almost unnecessary to remark that every uten- 
 sil connected with the dairy ought to be kept perfects 
 ly clean and sweet, being well scalded, and subse- 
 quently washed out with clean cokl water. The 
 milk, being drawn from the cow, should be put into 
 a vessel to cool — a clean tinned vessel is the best for 
 this purpose; it onght not to stand so long, or be al- 
 lowed to -cool so much, as to permit the cream to par- 
 tially separate; being cooled, it should be strain- 
 ed through a hair sieve into the milk dishes 
 (glass ones are the bast.) The depth of milk should 
 not exceed four inches; it is stated that two inches is 
 the most profitable mode. In a dairy maintained at 
 a proper temperature, the cream should be gathered 
 every twenty-four hours; but in very hot weather the 
 milk ought not to stand mure than eighteen hours, 

at the utmost. The common mode of procuring 
 cream is by a skimmer; others have constructed ves- 
 sels by which the blue or skim milk is allowed to 
 flow through an orifice in the bottom of the vessel. 
 Recently it has been proposed to use a syphon for 
 this purpose; the ordinary syphon is, however, very 
 troublesome. If syphons ever come into general use, 
 they ought to be formed of the annexed figure. 

When constructed with a curved terminal to each 
 leg, the syphon may be carried about, or may be hung 
 up for use at any moment, it being only requisite, in 
 using it, to maintain the leg placed in the milk at a 
 slight degree of elevation above the outer leg. Sy- 
 phons of this kind have been long in use in acid man- 
 ufaetcries. 

The processes used for making butter in different 
 districts are much more numerous than is generally 
 imagined ; a similar remark applies to the churns 
 used; the varieties of the latter have greatly increas- 
 ed of late years. For the present. I shall confine my 
 remarks to the mode of using the milk, cream, &c., 
 and the proper temperature of churning. The form 
 of the cliurn will receive subsequent attention. 

Some very elaborate experiments on butter-making 
 were undertaken by Professor Traill and the late Dr. 
 Bostock; they were published in the 'Highland Trans- 
 actions.' The writer of this paper was made ac- 
 quainted with many of these results by one of the 
 cvperimentcrs, now deceased, and subsequently test- 
 ed them on a working scale. Owing to removals, 
 and the lapse of time, the notes are lost or mislaid; 
 he, however, distinctly recollects that in .all instan- 
 ces but one the products, on an ordinary routine, 
 agreed remarkably with those made by the gentle- 
 men alluded to. 

One series consisted of "the comparative quantity 
 of butter yielded by the following:
