the imperfect manner in which it is pulverized, can 
 any one believe that it could bo omnipresent to stick 
 the sand together ? 

The learned commentator does not take the same 
 ground with Professor Mapes, and whilst in the 
 words of the poet, he says to me — 

Be silent jihtiiys, when you doubt your sense; 
 And speak, though sure, with seeming diffidence. 

Fope. 

he in art off handed way, disposes of us both. Does 
 he contend with his protege that lime will cor- 
 rode the sand, and combiiiO with it so as to form 
 silicate of lime, and that the consequent roughness 
 will hinder the sand from packing ? No ! He takes 
 a now ground, and advances a dogma of his own 
 creating, quite independent of the learned. Professor, 
 for whom he feels so much sympathy. He says: 

"Now if Mr. Browne is a chemist (as we suppose 
 "he is, from the fact that he advances original theo- 
 "ries on obscure chemical subjects,) he will certainly 
 "rtcollect the fact that a peculiar characteristic of 
 "that class of compounds called silicates, is that a 
 "large quantity of a previously formed silicate, pos- 
 "sesses the property of combining with an almost 
 "indefinitely small qu.antity of a new base (such as 
 "lime,) forming a double salt.'' 

It is to this cause, he refers for his mechanical 
 p.wer, which he says will lighten the soil. 

Before commenting on this theory, I will try to 
 set the commentator right in regard to the suppo- 
 sitions he has advanced touching myself. I am wil- 
 ling to own up, that I had at one time of my life, the 
 presumption, to write myselt down a chemist, and 
 after it was written — Geo. B. Browne — Ekve de lio- 
 biquet, Fabricant de produih chemiques — was wont to 
 survey it with considerable complacency. 

But that was twenty years gone. When I did 
 thus presume, I was fresh fledged from the world re- 
 nowned laboratory of Robiquct, in Paris. I had 
 made preparations for some of the then greatest 
 chemists in the world. Being at that age at which 
 men know least of themselves, I may have been ex- 
 cusable, fur somewhat falling into the same ludicrous 
 error with the old colored gentleman, who conceited 
 that he and his master, had painted a picture: Sam- 
 bo ground the paint, and massa daubed it on the 
 canvass. That day has gone by, and I no longer 
 conceit that I am a chemist. I am behind the age, 
 and am constantly made to feel my inferiority, when 
 brought in contact with such able gentlemen as the 
 learned commentator. I do not pretend to be a 
 chemist, but only to have a sufficient insight into the 
 science, to issue visionary theories, that the more 
 learned may have an opportunity to refute them. 
 This strange fancy of mine, works a public good) f^r 
 it draws into the arena more able writers, whose dif- 
 fidence might otherwise deprive the community of 
 the benefit of their labors. 

After this candid exposition, and disavowal, n;y 

readers will not be astonished, when I say to them, 
 that Id) not recollect hearing speak of any such 
 fact. 

But still we set it down as a fact, without further 
 inquiry or comment. In the first place, while every 
 reader will be ready to acknowledge the masterly 
 manner in which the commentary is written, and 
 that it bears within itself the evidence of being the 
 production of no ordinary intellect, but of one skill' 
 ed in the art: — yet as the author has not lent the 
 weight of his name to his production, it must stand 
 or fall on its own merits, and can derive no strength 
 from the gentleman's ipse dixit. No authority is 
 quoted. Here again we are at fault. 

Let us see what the learned commentator has real- 
 ly put forth in these few lines. He alleges that the 
 silicates (alitor dicta) the silicate of potassa, the si- 
 licate of soda, &c., are capable of combining at the 
 ordinary temperature with indefiiiiiely small quan- 
 tities of lime or any other base, and that the result 
 of this combination is a double salt. If such is the 
 case, it is indeed a peculiar characteristic. Let us 
 understand the length and breadth of this assertion, 
 which seems to be the keystone to my hopes to any 
 reputation as a chemist, at least in the opinion of the 
 commentator. If Mr. Browne is a chemist he will 
 recollect this fact, if he is not, he .will not recollect 
 it. If he does not recollect it he is no chemist. 

A previously existing silicate is capable of com- 
 bining at the ordinary temperature with any and 
 every proportion of lime or any other base, and that 
 any and every of these combinations will be a double 
 salt, and the double salts thus formed, will be more 
 or less soluble, their solubility depending on the 
 proportion the silicic acid bears to the new base. 
 We are not told whether the solubility increases or 
 diminishes with the increase of silicic acid. 

What is a double salt ? To answer this question 
 we must define a salt. As silicic acid is an oxygen 
 acid, we need only consider such salts as are formed 
 by the combination of an oxygen acid with a base. 
 A salt of this character is a compound of an electro- 
 negative bi elementary compound, such as the com- 
 pound of one atom of silicom with three atoms of ox- 
 ygen, and known as silicic acid, and a bi elementary 
 electropositive compound such as the compound of 
 one atom of potassium and one atom of oxygen, 
 known as potassa. The former is an acid, the latter 
 is a base. This class of bases has the property of 
 neutralizing such acids as silicic acid. This com- 
 pound is the silicate of potash. Si 03X K 0. 

A double salt is formed in two ways, an example 
 of one of which we have inRoohelle salts. Tartaric 
 acid is a bi basic acid, or in other words, two atoms 
 of water, are essential to its existence. Its salts form- 
 ed with one atom of a base are sour, and upon exam- 
 ination are found to consist of one atom of tartaric 
 acid, one atom of the base and one atom of water.
