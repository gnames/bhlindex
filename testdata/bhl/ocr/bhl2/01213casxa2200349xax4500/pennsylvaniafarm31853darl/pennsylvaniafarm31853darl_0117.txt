By some chemists it is considered a tartrate of pot- 
 ash and water. By the addition of an equivalent of 
 soda, Rochelle salts is formed, and it is found to con- 
 sist of one equivalent of the tartaric acid, one of pot- 
 ash and one of soda. You perceive, therefore, that 
 the potash expelled one equivalent of water, and the 
 soda the other. Owing to this peculiarity which is 
 not confined to tartaric acid but belongs to many of 
 them, it is said to be bi basic. 
 Double salts are formed bypalifying two equivalents 
 of two distinct bases, one equivalent of each with 
 two equivalents of the same acid. The acid employ- 
 ed in this case is a monobasic acid, such an acid only 
 requires one atom of water as essential to its existence. 
 Such double salts may be separated by christiliza- 
 tion, provided they are unequally soluble. They 
 would not be considered double salts, except that 
 they display, when together, some attributes which 
 are not common to them when alone. Silicic acid is 
 an acid which belongs to neither of the two described 
 classes, but belongs to quite a different one. 

Sulphuric acid, tilluric acid, stannic acid, arsenic 
 acid, silicic acid, (fee, do not require any water, and 
 may be obtained in what is called the dry state. In 
 this dry state they display very feeblg acid qualities, 
 and do not display any affinity fo^the bases except 
 at high temperatures. Silicic acid is not bibasic, 
 and consequently a previously existing silicate can- 
 not combine with any base presented to it so as to 
 form a double salt. A double salt may be formed by 
 fusing together two previously formed silicates. The 
 silicate of potash for instance not containing more 
 acid than is necessary for its own combination, can- 
 not take into combination any other base. Such 
 might not be the case were the salt already formed a 
 bi silicate, or a sesquisilicate. But with this we 
 have nothing to do, as they are not the salts mention- 
 ed by the commentator. 

But the learned gentleman says that a new base 
 such as lime will combine in any (indefinite) propor- 
 tion. This is contrary to the theory of definite pro- 
 portions, and although I have great respect for the 
 gentleman's opinion on the subject, must demur. 

The learned gentleman saj's that the addition of 
 lime to these previously existing silicates, will cause 
 a double salt to be formed whose solubility depends 
 entirely upon the proportion of the silicic acid to the 
 new base. 

The silicate of potash and the silicate of soda, I 
 presume, are the most important ones found in the 
 soil, and of them we will speak more particularly. 
 They are either of them soluble in hot water, but 
 sparingly affected by cold water. So likewise the 
 double salt made by fusing them together. If we 
 make a glass of the following composition 

Potash - - - 100 

Silex .... 100 

we will havs a glass that will not at the ordinary 

temperature be stable, but will draw the moisture 
 from the air, and the result will be, that a tumbler 
 made from such glass wil', after remaining in the 
 air some time, be found to contain carbonate of pot 
 ash in solution. If, on the contrary, we make a 
 glass compounded of 

Potash - - - 100 

Silex - - - - 100 

Lime - - - - 100 

we will have a glass that will be unalterable in the 

air at common temperatures. 

It is for this reason that lime (or the oxide of lea'l) 
 has been found indispensable as an ingredient in 
 glass, at least so says Dumas, vol. 2, p. 557. 

Some of the felspars contain no lime, some of them 
 contain lime, and yet the latter are not any more 
 soluble than the former. 

In conclusion, I feel greatly flattered that so highly 
 gifted a critic should have reviewed my letters on 
 lime, and has not found more defects. I had not 
 expected as much for them. 

As to the parental advice contained in the closing 
 part of the commentator's article, he will accept my 
 thanks. I will endeavor in future, to be more meek 
 and modest in my address when speaking of the 
 learned. Much excuse should however be made for 
 one, who has not had the advantages that such gen- 
 tlemen as Professor Mapes and the learned commen- 
 tator have no doubt enjoyed, and his rude speech, 
 and strong language should not be misconstrued in- 
 to boastful arrogance.

The following article from one who has long been 
 a correspondent of the Farm Journal, was accom- 
 panied by a letter informing us of her removal to 
 Adrian, Michigan. While we regret to loose so fair 
 and agreeable writer, as well as close observer, from 
 our own State, we are pleased that she intends still 
 to continue favoriogusoccasionally with her observa- 
 tions on Agricultural and Horticultural matters in 
 that new region.

Mr. Fabm Journal: 

It so frequently happens in 
 these days that science parades some new and indis- 
 putable discovery in natural philosophy, which every 
 "old superstitious farmer and his wife" at once re- 
 cognized, as nwhirn of their grandparents, that it is 
 a very nice matter to determine where old sayings 
 differ from scientific truth. 

Very many unlearned persons will tell you that in 
 transplanting trees and shrubs, you should be care- 
 ful to place towards the North, the same side of the 
 tree, shrub or plant, which had looked Northward in 
 i the former situation.
