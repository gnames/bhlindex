Science informa us, that the magnetic current, 
 which is the life of nature, passes always around the 
 earth in the same direction; that consequently the 
 trees growing by its influence, are accustomed to the 
 tide of its current, so that if turned, they do not re- 
 ceiYe it in theiV accustomed manner, and cannot 
 thrive until they have accommodated themselves to 
 receive the subtle but mighty influence, in their new 
 position. 

In this as in unnumbered instances science con- 
 firms the unwritten traditiou of long observation — 
 for it is a fact that trees do thrive better if their orig- 
 inal positions with respect to North and South, be 
 carefully preserved. 

Let Horticulturists experiment and observe the 
 result.

 Rape or Colza. Brassica Campestris, 

Rape Seed is not only an object of the greatest im- 
 pn-tanee and value, wherever it is raised for the sake 
 of the seed, but is likewise extremely valuable as 
 green food for cattle and sheep, in the fall or spring, 
 or cured for hay for winter. * 

The Colza or Rape is a plant which requires by 
 preference, a strong soil, although it will come well 
 on good sand or gravelly loams, besides careful cul- 
 tivation. 

In Belgium, and the northern parts of France, 
 where it it is raised in great abundanoe,it enters into 
 the regular rotation on all good heavy loams, and is 
 thought to be one of the best preparations for wheat, 
 owing to the tillage of the soil, the manure ap- 
 plied for it, and the care taken to keep it clear of 
 weeds. 

The ground should be ploughed in the fall and in 
 the spring, and again a short time before sowing, 
 and well manured. Then the seed should be sown 
 very thin in drills, and harrowed in in June or Jul)/_ 
 As the plants come up, they should be weeded and 
 thined out, a foot apart. A superior mode is to sow 
 ■ the seed broadcast, on a good rich seed bed, prepar- 
 ed on purpose. AVhen the stubble of any grain crop 
 has been cleared off Ijy the harrow, the land well ma- 
 nured and ploughed to a good depth, the plants are 
 brought out, and set out as cabbage plants are. 
 This can be done the latter end of September, or in 
 October, either by the dibble and by hand, setting 
 them out in every respect like the plants of cabbage, 
 in rows two to two and a half feet wide, and one 
 foot in the row; or to save much time, labor and 
 trouble, they can be put in furrows one foot apart, 
 after the plough, taking care to put them up right in 
 the furrow, and to cover them by the return of the 
 plough, leaving the leaves above ground, and after 
 the piece is finished, going over it to dress all plants 
 that might be covered too deep, which can be done 

by a man walking along the furrows and pressing " 
 his foot against the plant, or with the hoc. The in- 
 tervals between the rows should get a hoeing, or the ' 
 cultivator run in, or a small plow sent through, to I 
 give them an earthing up, killing the weeds at the 
 same time, which should be done as late in the fall 
 as the weather will permit, in November or Decem- 
 ber. Thus they will remain all winter without injury 
 from the frost. 

In spring, they should have the cultivator run be- ' 
 tween them again, and weeded, or another slight 
 earthing given them, which will greatly strengthen 
 the plants. 

The quantitity of seed to be sown, should be from 
 five to eight pounds per acre; and this should be 
 sown in the bed or in the rows evenly. It is a great 
 advantage, that the cost of the seed is so trifling in 
 proportion to the value of the crop. 

It is ready to cut and reap when the upper branch- 
 es turn brown, which will be in June or July. Be j 
 sure not to let it be too ripe, for if the pods be too 
 dry at reaping, they will shed the seed in the field, 
 and cause much loss. 

It can be reaped in the same manner as wheat, but 
 the hand fulls should te laid singly and light upon 
 the stubble, behind the reapers, and thus it should 
 lie without stirring, until it is ready to thresh out, 
 which will be in a short time, particularly as gener- 
 ally at that time, the weather is dry and warm. 

When it is ready and perfectly dry, prepare a floor 
 in the middle of the field, by levelling the ground, 
 on which should be spread a large muslin cloth, 
 twenty to thirty feet square; spread the rows round, 
 and thrash round. One man or a boy to spread be- 
 fore the thrasher, and another to turn; or it can be 
 thrashed by a thrashing machine, in this case taking 
 care, if the seed is intended to be thrashed on the 
 barn floor, to remove the plants on a large sheet 
 spread on the wagon, to prevent loss of seed, by the 
 jolting and shaking of the wagon. 

The seed can then be stored in a dry and airy 
 granary until it is sent to be sold or crushed. 

The Rape in good ground, well treated, does not 
 fail to make strong stems and succulent leaves, so 
 that by the middle or latter end of Noveml>cr, it 
 will be strong enough to bear pasturing; then turn 
 in the sheep, but take care they do not eat but just 
 the leaves, which they will crop first, not suflfering 
 them to touch the stalks, as that would be injurious 
 to the plants. This will form one of the best pas- 
 tures for your sheep, if you keep any, and will make 
 them fat and in good condition; or the leaves can be 
 gathered for hogs or cattle, but I do not advise by 
 any means to turn in horned cattle or hogs, for the i 
 damage they will do to the stalks. The only safe 
 stock to turn into Rape, in my opinion, being sheep. , 

The produce of an acre of Rape, will be according 
 to the condition of the land, management and care.
