from twenty bushels upwards to fifty, which will com- 
 mand from three and a half to four dollars a bushel, 
 in Philadelphia, New York, Boston, or Baltimore. 
 The yield will be materially affected by the care giv- 
 en to it in thrashing it properly. A very full crop 
 will be from fifty to sixty bushels, and upwards of 
 eighty bushels have been and are raised frequently 
 in Flanders. 

Great advantage may be derived from cultivating 
 it in the following manner: 

Take half an acre of good land, or make it so by 
 manuring, and work it a little better than ordinary 
 land, or as you should your garden. At mid-sum- 
 mer, (.June or July) sow on this half acre, thirty 
 pounds, or two pecks of Rape seed — this will pro- 
 duce a plentiful crop, as few grains will miss; let them 
 grow until the middle of September; take eight or ten 
 acres of wheat or oats, or early corn; plough the 
 stubble, and let it lie a month or six weeks to rot, 
 then plough it again; if the land has been manured 
 previously, it will thus be in good condition. 

Begin at one side, plough a furrow, set the plants 
 in the furrow, at the distance of a foot, leaning a- 
 gainst the side of the furrow; set the plough and 
 make another furrow, at two feet distant from the 
 first, and in returning it will cover the first furrow 
 planted, and continue so until the whole field is set. 

If the land, as I suppose it is, is good, i. e. has 
 been properly manured for the previous crops, wheat, 
 oats, &c., there will be no occasion to manure it now, 
 but if not, have your manure laid in heaps, and 
 throw a little at the root of every plant, a handful 
 will be sufficient; or, which is preferable, by throw- 
 ing a handful of guano, previously well mixed with 
 four times its bulk of earth or a good handful of 
 any good chemical fertilizer, at the foot of every plant, 
 the produce will be large, and the seed of good qual- 
 ty; in transplanting it will tell all the better in the 
 crop, to roll the roots of the plants in plaster of Par- 
 is, or ashes, or both mixed. 

When the Rape is reaped, then sow turnips; thus 
 three profitable crops can be got out in two years 
 from the same piece of land, and the two last will 
 improve your land. 

As observed above, Rape on land makes one of the 
 best preparations for wheat, but in this latter in- 
 stance, I prescribe a crop of turnips after it, if fol- 
 lowing probably wheat, or at least a grain crop. 

The above is the management of IFtnfer Rape; 
 there is another variety, called Spring or March 
 Rape — this is cultivated and handled in every re- 
 spect as the former, with this difference, that it is 
 sown early in the spring, March or April; hence its 
 name. Spring or March Rape or Colza. 

It does not yield quite so large a produce as the 
 Winter Rape, but as it can be sown in the spring, 
 and harvested at the latter end of the summer, or 
 early fall of the same year, it thus has great claims 

to our attention and care. It requires the same quan- 
 tity of seed as the Winter Rape. 

The Rape plant is not only of great value in the 
 economy of the farm, as one of the best plants for 
 fodder, as after thrashing the seeds out, the plant is 
 valuable, and yields a large quantity of nutritious 
 fodder, relished by all kinds of stock, but it is as 
 invaluable as a plant yielding one of the best and 
 most prolific of all oleaginous seeds, that is to be 
 considered and emploj'ed, and must attract our most 
 earnest and diligent attention, besides the cultiva- 
 tion of it being, as observed above, a good prepara- i 
 tion of the land for cereal or grain crops. 

The Rape is likewise extremely valuable for the 
 residue or cake left after expressing oil from the seed, 
 which is used extensively for feeding and fattening 
 cattle. It forms likewise one of the most powerful 
 manures, being extensively used in England and oth- 
 er countries, and the effects of it are as immediate 
 and powerful as the best and most concentrated ma- | 
 nures hitherto known. It is as immediate and pow- 
 erful as guano, with this difference, that it benefits 
 after crops more than guano does. As a feed for cat- 
 tle, it cannot be surpassed in its fattening qualities; 
 pound for pound it has a greater effect than the 
 fresh seed itself. 

It 'is in the manufacture of oil from its seeds, that 
 it deserves to have a distinguished place among the 
 profitable crops, profitable not not only from the pe- 
 cuniary advantages, derived directly from its culti- 
 vation, for in supposing that only a minimum crop 1 
 of twenty bushels should be raised, still, as the price i 
 is generally nearer and sometimes over §4, than S3J; 
 such a low crop even at $70 gross per acre, is cer- 
 tainly no despicable figure, when taken into account 
 that the value of this fodder will go nearly to pay 
 the expense of its cultivation, but the manufacture 
 of its seeds into one of the best and most valuable 
 oils, gives it claim to great preeminence, by the great 
 services it thus renders to agriculture, and to manu- 
 factures. 

The Rape Oil is one of the most valuable oils 
 known in the arts of manufactures; at once servicea- 
 ble for burning, eating, fulling, for the tanner, for the 
 soap boiler, for machinery, &c., &c. 

This oil used for machinery, properly prepared, 
 does not gum as other oils do. 

Already has the attention of government been di- 
 rected to it, to supply our light-houses on the coast, 
 with a good burning oil, as fish oil is constantlj' rais- 
 ing in price, and whale and sperm fi.sh getting scar- 
 cer every year, and particularly should it happen, in 
 the natural course of events, that the price offish oils 
 gets affected by the political changes which occur of- 
 ten (against all calculations) of such a nature as 
 very materially to affect and enhance the price of all ' 
 articles and produce which we derive through our
