Potatoes are not raised for market, but are an item 
 not readily dispensed Witli in the family economy- 
 Each farmer plants about half an acre, generally af- 
 ter corn, though some use a grass sod. It is the uni- 
 versal practice to apply long barn-yard manure, at 
 the rate of twenty-five or thirty ox carl loads per 
 acre; this is spread and ploughed in during all the 
 Fourth month, (xVpril,) dropping the cuttings of one 
 or more eyes each, (taken by some from small, by 
 others from large seed,) on the land side of every 
 third furrow, from sis to ten inches apart; some rake 
 the manure into each planted furrow; roll or J^arrow 
 after planting; as soon as the plants begin to appear 
 harrow once, pass the cultivator through twice, at in- 
 tervals of a week, and lastly ridge up with the plough. 
 Hand hoe at the first hoe harrowing, sprinkling one 
 to two bushels plaster along the rows, and hand 
 pick weeds at the ploughing. Dig as soon as the 
 vines die; this is mostly about the first of Ninth 
 month, (September,) and if any appearance of rot, 
 spread upon a board floor, and sprinkle with fresh 
 slaked quick lime, until the approach of cold weath- 
 er, then place in the cellar. Seed used— Mercer, 

We have not been exempt from that inscrutable 
 disease, the rot, nor do we know any cure, though 
 from the sandy nature of our soil, we have suffered 
 less than many other sections. To guard against it 
 as a pi-eventive, experience has led to early planting 
 upon high light soil. It first appeared in 1843, when 
 the writer had half an acre on a flat, heavy clay, 
 north exposure; planted Fifth month ^nth; dug 
 Ninth month twenty-fifth; growth of tubers very fine 
 but almost all alFeoted by a virulent rot. Gathered 
 eight bushels of the apparently sound, spread them 
 out, but lost most of them. Since then, with eo.rly 
 planting upon sandy ham have lost none of any ac- 
 count, though the disease has been developed in a 
 few tubers, say half a dozen, nearly every year,and at 
 times neighbors have lost nearly all on low ground. 
 During the time seed has been renewed twice, from 
 Maine and Jersey, with manifest advantage. The 
 last year, the following experiment was tried upon 
 three-fourths of an acre; After corn, first ploughed 
 and harrowed, then half an acre covered heavily 
 ■with long barn-yard manure, spread evenly, and 
 ploughed in every furrow; cuttings dropped every 
 third furrow, eight inches apart; one-half from l.xrge, 
 the other from small potatoes, about the size of hick- 
 ory nuts. Planted Fourth month the twenty-third, 
 (the spring was very backward;) dug Ninth month 
 the ninth; growth of vines modenitely fair; all dead 
 previous to digging; the yield from half, pdanted from 
 large seed, was estimated at one-half more of mar- 
 ketable ones than the other, and one-third more alto- 
 gether; slight traces of the rot perceptible; the re- 
 mainder of the patch, one-fourth acre, was divided 
 into equal portions. All were struck out in furrows,

three feet apart; one h.alf manured heavily with fresh 
 horse stable manure; the other received a compost 
 of leached ashes, lime and plaster; ashes J, lime i-, 
 plaster J; about ten bushels to the one-eighth acre, 
 each in the furrows; cuttings dropped and covered 
 with a hoe. The first half were planted Third month 
 the twenty-second, followed by a month of cold, wet 
 weather, — ^Cuttings from small seed, the vines grew 
 luxuriantly, and many of them retained their vitality 
 when dug; tubers numerous, but many small; none 
 rotted. The second half, or ashed part, were planted 
 Fourth month the twenty-third; cuttings half from 
 small, half from large seed; the same difference per- 
 ceptible as noted above; growth of vines light, all 
 dead, sometime previous to digging; these were the 
 earliest matured, very fine in quality, of good size, 
 but very few in the ground; no rot.

Stirriug the Soil. 

Mr. EoiTon; — Experience has long since satisfied 
 me that frequent stirring of the soil, is a preventive, 
 to a very great extent, of the ordinary effects of 
 drought. 

I do not, of course, wish to be understood as in- 
 cluding the doctrine that it Will render rain unneces- 
 sary, for this would be to deny the wisdom of a very 
 important provision of Providence; but that itenables 
 the farmer to derive importaut benefits from this soil, at 
 times and in important seasons when the windows of 
 heaven appear to be literally closed, and tlie earth 
 languisheth for the kindly and life-imparting rain.
