AYRSHIRE COWS, &c.

Ayrshire Cows. 

Our engraving opposite, exhibits what is said to be 
 a faithful portrait of the imported Ayrshire oo\v> 
 Ayr. The cow on the right, is Charlotte, pure Dur- 
 ham, introduced to show the relative size of the tvfo 
 breeds. They are both the property of E. P. Pren- 
 tice, Mount Hope, near Albany. Ayr is the mother 
 of Dundee Second, whoso portrait was in our last 
 number, to which we refer, also for some aoeount of 
 the Ayrshii-es. The subjoined description of Ayr, 
 Vi'e copy from a former number of the Cultivator, 
 where the engraving first appeared. 

Ayr, whoso iikoiitd-s 'las been Very accurately de- 
 lineated V>y Mr. Van Zandt, was imported in 1842. 
 Slie is nearly a model of what, in our opinion, a dairy 
 coio should be, and on this account we deem it proper 
 to give a tolerably full description of her. She po- 
 sesaes in a high degree the excellent milking prop- 
 erties which distinguish the best of the breed to 
 which she belongs, united to a more perfect symme- 
 try than we have ever seen in any other Ayrshire, 
 «nd which we have seldom, if ever, known equalled 
 in any breed. Iler body, (as will be seen by a com- 
 parison of the figures,) is small: but her frame or 
 bone is proportionately less. The head is small, 
 the face dished, the forehead broad, and the eye 

Erominent. The neek is small at the juncture of the 
 ead. but pretty deep and full at its connection with 
 the body. The back is straight, the crops fine, the 
 ribs round, the loins broad, the flanks deep, the ud- 
 der capacious, (spreading wide on the body, but not 
 hanging low,) and the milk-veins large and promi- 
 nent. The legs are small, but strong, hard and sin- 
 ewy, like those of a deer. The great depth and length 
 of the hind quarters might, from a profile view, give 
 the idea that the chest was too light: but though the 
 hind quarters are proportionately heaviest, (as we 
 prefer to have them in a milch cow,) there is no de- 
 ficiency in the fore end. The sternum (or breast 
 bone) is wide, the fore legs stand wide apart, the 
 bosoin is full, and the first ribs are particularly full 
 and wide-spread at their junction with the sternum, 
 giving a chest of great capacity for an animal of her 
 size. 

As her form and general appearance indicate, she 
 is healthy and hardy. Her skin is of a yellowish 
 hue, mellow and elastic; and though she does not po- 
 sess the fattening quality in an exoesive degree, or 
 to an extent that would interfere with her dairy qual- 
 ities, she thrives very rapidly when not giving milk. 
 The quantity of milk she aSords is, in proportion to 
 her size, quite extraordinary. She has given, when 
 on grass feed only, upwards of twenty quarts (by ac- 
 tual measure) per day, and she continues in milk till 
 near calving. No particular experiments have been 
 made uith her in regard to butter, but her milk has 
 been ascertained to produce a large proportion of the 
 richest cream. 

Her ofi'spring are much like herself. She has had 
 four calves since she left Scotland. The first, a heif- 
 er, was dropped on shipboard during the passage; 
 the next, a very fine bull, is now owned by Mr. J. 
 W. Howes, of Montpelier, Vt.; the next a bull, now 
 nearly two years old, a very superior animal, inher- 
 iting in a remarkable degree the characters of the 
 dam; and the next a heifer, equally as fine as her 
 other progenj', now about two months old. The two 
 last, together with three grand-daughters of Ayr, are 
 still in Mr. Prentice's possession. 

E. P. Prentice has been for many years, a breeder 

of choice animals, and to his several importations! 
 the whole country are indebted for some of its bes' 
 stock. We understand his experience with the Ayr* 
 shires, induces him to give them the preference for 
 deep milking, over the Durhams, and as he had con- 
 siderable trial with both breeds,his opinion is entitled 
 to great weight. All facts tending to settle the great 
 question of which is the best breed of cows for the 
 dairy, are interesting to the public, and we should be 
 obliged by havi ng the experience of farmers in diff- 
 erent parts of the country, on this point. We have 
 had more to do with the pure Durhams, than any 
 other breed, and can only aay for ourselves, that 
 we value them and their crosses, with our selected 
 common stock, before any thing else. The most pro- 
 ductive dairies in this vicinity, are of such a cross. 
 One of our cows, an imported Durham, made 15J^ lbs, 
 of butter per week, and her cream was so thick that 
 it could be taken off the pan of milk, by lapping 
 over, and in a single piece. Butter was made from 
 it on one occasion in a teacup, by stirring with a 
 spoon, in a little more than a minute. This was an 
 extraordinary case but there are certain families 
 of Durhams, which have been bred with reference 
 to deep milking, more than for beef, and by select- 
 ing such with good pedigrees, the milking property 
 has been found to be generally well sustained. Our 
 columns are however, open to the discussion of this 
 question, about which we know there is much vari- 
 ety of opinion. 

High Price of Cattle. 

The continued high price of cattle appears to be a 
 marvel to feeders of cattle. A New York paper says 
 a very material advance in the prices of beef cattle 
 has recently taken place in this market, referable, we 
 find, on inquiry, not so much to a growing scarcity 
 in those sections of the country, whence come sup- 
 plies, nor to an increased consumption at homo, but 
 to the springing up of new inviting markets else- 
 where. The grazers in the Northern Hlinois region, 
 who have heretofore been among the most extensive 
 contributors i the tq-cat cattle markets of New York, 
 Philadelphia, Baltnnore, t o..t c, we are now told, 
 now drive their herds across the plains to supp'v the 
 demand which invites them to California. Hence 
 just now, the comparative scarcity of cattle in this 
 "market, which produces in turn the high prices ask- 
 ed for beef at wholesale — say from nine to ten and 
 a half cents per pound. At these rates, the r -tail 
 consumers must be content with fifteen and sixteen 
 cents, or thereabouts. Beef is thus becoming a lux- 
 ury which only the rich man is able to enjoy. — [Ex- 
 change. 

Tu Fatten Fowls. 

The beat food for fattening fowls is potatoes mixed 
 with meal. Boil the potatoes, and mash them fine 
 while they are hot, and mix the meal with them just 
 before it is presented. They fatten on this diet in 
 less than half the time ordinarily required to bring 
 them to the same condition ot excellence on corn 
 or even the meal itself.
