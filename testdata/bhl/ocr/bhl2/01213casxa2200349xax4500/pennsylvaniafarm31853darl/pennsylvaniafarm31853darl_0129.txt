Cooper's I>ime Spreader. 

The above cut represents the Lime Spreader, inven" 
 ted and patented by Lewis Cooper, of Coopersville, 
 Lancaster county, Pa., and is represented as a most 
 admirable implement for the purposes for which it is 
 intended. Although but recently patented, and but 
 little efforts made to introduce it to public notice, its 
 merits have already won for it a high place in the 
 estimation of a large number of intelligent and ob- 
 servant farmers, in our own and adjoining States. 
 Some of the advantages enumerated in its behalf 
 are: 

1. It saves labor and time, and does its work with 
 inimitable evenness. 

2. It is an entire machine in itself, to which a pair 
 •of horses, oxen, or mules, may be hitched, and a load 
 carried, without waste, to the place where it is to be 
 used, where it may be put in operation in half % 
 minute, and will evenly distribute any desired quan- 
 tity to an aore. 

S. It weighs no more than a good ox-cart, and wilj 
 carrj as lajge a load, 

4. It feeds itself, crushes and thoroughly pulver' 
 izes all hard lumps, and even small hti9ij}s of' core, 
 while large lumps will not injure the machine, but 
 having been cleaned of all the lime that is on them, 
 may be thrown out as refuse when the. trough be- 
 comes empty. 

5. With it, one man and team can do at least aa 
 much work as four men and two teams without it, 
 while the evenness with which the work is done can 
 in no way be equakd, 

6. The machinery is simple and strong, not liable 
 to get out of order, and very durable — the workiag 
 parts being all of iron. 

The want of such a machine as this, has long 
 been felt, as it is not only a labor-saving, but a lime 
 saving implement, "spreading thu lime evenly as a 
 snow-fall," thus securing regularity in every part 
 of the field. Besides this, it can be regulated to 
 spread almost any desired quantity to the acre. 

Mr. Cooper having made arrangements to manu- 
 facture more extensively than heretofore, he will for 
 the future be able to supply all demands. Paschall 
 Jlorris & Co., 380 Girard Row, Market street, Phila- 
 adelphia, are the agents for that city, and machines 
 may be seen at their Agricultural Warehouse, any 
 time after the first of July. 

Fruit Trees. 

All agree, says a loading cultivator of fruit in 
 Massachusetts, that the proper and only judicious 
 method of preparing the soil for fruit trees is, by 
 sub-soiling or trenching the earUi to the depth of 
 eighteen inches or two feet, and that, during this 
 pi'ooess, the upper and lower soils, together with the 
 appropriate manure, should be thoroughly incorpo- 
 rated: The cultivator who is notwilling to take these 
 preliminary measures had better abandon the project 
 of raising fruit trees, and save both his time and 
 m oney. 

Downing states that the best compost for fruit 
 trees is — peat and ashes (five bushels of fresh, or ten 
 bushels of leached) — a wagon load of peat, contain- 
 ing lime, potash and phosphates. 

Let this compost lie a fortnight. Add to every 
 cart load two bushels of air-sLacked lime, for apple 
 trees. 

Add half bushel of ground bones, two bushels of 
 ashes or five pounds of potash dissolved in water — 
 for pear tt-ees. 

Add half bushel of lime, half bushel of ashes, a 
 peck of salt — for plum trees. 

Add two bushels leached ashes — for peach and 
 cherry trees. 

Add a bushel of lime, a bushel of ashes, half bush- 
 el of plaster — for grape oines. 

This compost may be put on two inches thick, and 
 forked in, so as to cover the ground as far as the 
 roots extend. 

The proportions will vary according to the quan- 
 tity of compost to be made. 

By the analysis of Dr. Emmons, the ash of the ap- 
 ple tree contains more than one-half limr; so lime 
 largely prepjndprates in the numure. Tlie ash of 
 the pear tree contains the largest amount of plios- 
 rihateof lime: .so bone dust should preponderate in 
 the manure. — [Valley Farmer.
