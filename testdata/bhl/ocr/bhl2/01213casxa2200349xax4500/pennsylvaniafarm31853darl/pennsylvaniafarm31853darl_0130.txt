For the Farm Journal. 
 The Strawberry Controversy. 

The statement of Mr. Meeiian, in the April num- 
 ber of the Farm Journal, alleging that he has observ- 
 ed the sexual characters of the Strawberry-flowers to 
 be variously modified by culture, or different methods 
 of treatment, — has elicited some strong asseverations 
 of opinion, in contradiction to that allegation of /ac/. 
 One writer unhesitatingly declares the alleged change 
 to be "uiterhj impossihU:" and I understand that in 
 the Queen City of the West, they have had a piuWic 
 gathering, to deliberate on the subject, which result 
 ed in a Pronunciamenio adverse to Mr. Meehan' 
 statement, — his facts and observations being rejected 
 by a clear majority of the voters present ! The mat- 
 ter being thus settled, by preamble and resolution, af 
 ter the manner of political difficulties at a war- 
 meeting, it may seem to be out of order, now, to offer 
 any remarks on the controverted topic. Neverthe- 
 less, as this is reputed to be a Free Country, I should 
 like to be indulged with the privilege of submitting 
 a few suggestions, — if not in arrest of judgment, at 
 least as a plea in mitigation of the sentence, ao-ainst 
 my friend Meehan. It is the remark of a vigorous 
 and sagacious modern writer, that "no scientific ques- 
 tion was ever yet settled dogmatically, nor ever will;" 
 and I think the same may be especially predicated of 
 questions of fact, in Natural History. I may here 
 observe, that I was favored with the opportunity of 
 examining one of Mr. Meehan's specimens, — in which 
 there were certainly two scapes from the same root — 
 one bearing a cynie of pistillate flowers (with minute 
 rudiments of abortive stamens,) and the other a 
 a cyme of perfect, or hermaphrodite flowers: and 
 whether the specimen was the progeny of a pistillate, 
 a staminate, or a hermaphrodite plant, I should think 
 the inference plausible, if not irresistible, that the 
 flo wers on at least one of these two cymes, must have 
 been a modification, or altered product, of the parent 
 plant. It is this kind of change, in the character of 
 the flowers, which I understand Mr. Meehan to an- 
 nounce, as having occurred in plants under his man- 
 agement. Now, in view of the countless modifica- 
 tions daily observable in the organs of plants — and 
 especially in the floral organs — I can perceive no suf. 
 flcient ground for declaring the changes, reported by 
 Mr. Meehan, to be "utierli/ impiossihle." The modifi- 
 cations here referred to, are a very different thing 
 from the alleged transmutation of one kind to anoth- 
 er, — which is vulgarly supposed to take place in cer- 
 tain plants, just as the Alchemists formerly pretend- 
 ed was effected among the metals: They merely al- 
 ter the texture, distort the forms, or affect the deveL 
 opement, of organs; but do neither change nor anni- 
 hilate those essential characteristics, by which the 
 plant is rendered permanently distinct from every 
 other genus and species. The floral organs of many 
 plants are remarkably subject to modification, under 

culture, or management. Some flowers are render- 
 ed double, as it is termed, by the expansion of stam- 
 ens into petals; others become imperfect, and even 
 neutral, by the abortion or blighting of the stam- 
 ens, or pistils, or both. The Strawberri/ appears to 
 be very liable to this kind of blight; and hence the 
 much talked of sorts, among cultivators, of pistillates, 
 and staminates, —ihongh in all the pistillate flowers, 
 which I have examined, there were vestiges more or 
 less obvious, of abortive stainens, on the rim of the 
 calyx. It also varies much, under culture, in some 
 other features,— especially in the developement and 
 character or quality of the receptacle, or what is com- 
 monly regarded as fruit: but no one, I. believe, haf- 
 yetseenaStrawberryplant transmuted into a Oinque- 
 /ojV,— though so nearly allied in habit. The or- 
 gans of plants may be greatly disguised by the influ- 
 ences above mentioned; but still the essential distin- 
 guishing traits are preserved,— and there seems to be 
 no insuperable obstacle to prevent a plant, with mod- 
 ified or abortive organs, from reverting, under a ■ 
 change of circumstances, to its original condition, 
 and resuming its pristine form and character. The 
 normal, or what may be called the constitutional 
 character of the Straw))erry-flower, is to be perfect— 
 i. e. furnished with both stamens and pistils (possibly 
 such may be the true normal structure of all flow- 
 ers); and although many other plants, as well as the 
 Strawberry, are found with imperfect, and even 7ieu- 
 tral flowers, — every Naturalist and careful observer 
 knows, that there is often an obvious effort and ten- 
 dency, in such flowers, to a more complete develop- 
 ment: i. e. to become perfect and regidar. We oc- 
 casionally see diandrous flowers become didynamcms, 
 —and didynamons plants developing regular pentan- 
 droits flowers; and it is not at all unusual to find 
 the staminate tassel of the cultivated Maize [Zea 
 Mays, L. a monoicous plant,) bearing fertile flowers, 
 and exhibiting a very successful attempt at the pro- 
 duction of an Ear — or cluster of Ears—of Indian 
 corn. These instances, I trust (for it is needless to 
 multiply them,) may suffice to show that there is 
 nothing irrational, nor incredible, in Mr. Meehan's 
 observations; and that it is rather strong phraseology, 
 to declare such phenomena to be "utterly impossible." 
 The polemic writers on this Strawberry question, 
 speak of the necessity of staminate plants among 
 the pistillate, to produce, or perfect the fruit. No 
 doubt, the pistils must be fertilized, in order to pro- 
 duce seeds that will vegetate. But what do those 
 gentlemen understand, by the 'fruit?" Do they 
 mean the little single-seeded akenes, or mitlets, which. 
 are sprinkled over the enlarged pulpy receptacle, — • 
 or do they refer to the receptacle, itself, which in pop- 
 ular parlance ia intended by the term "fruit ?" If 
 they have reference to the real fruit — the nutlets 

which contain the seed, — there is probably no ques- 
 , tion (as already intimated) about the necessity of 
 the long-continued influences of soil, climate, and ' staminate influence to produce perfect fruit. But I
