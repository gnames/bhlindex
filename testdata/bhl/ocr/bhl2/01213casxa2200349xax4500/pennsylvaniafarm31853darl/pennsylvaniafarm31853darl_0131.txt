have a suspicion, that hy the term "fndt," they 
 mean the delicious receptacle ■which bears the fruit, 
 and if they mean to allege that the pistils mnst be 
 fertilized by the stamens, in order to produce that en- 
 lanjcment of the receptacle which affords an esculent 
 substitute for fruit, — then I have only to say, it is a 
 question of fact, which I have had no adequate op- 
 portunity to determine; and concerning which I, for 
 one, should be happy to receive reliable information. 
 To ascertain the point satisfactorily, would require 
 very careful experiments and observations. Wheth- 
 er such have been made, I am not informed. I may 
 remark, however, by way of analogy, that there are 
 instances in which pistils, and even receptacles, axe 
 enlarged, where no staminate influence has been ex- 
 erted. The conglomerate coalescent pistils of the 
 Osage Orange {Madura,) for example, attain to their 
 full natural size (although the seeds are necessarily 
 imperfect,) whore no staminate plant is in the neigh- 
 borhood: and, what affords a closer analogy, the in- 
 cluding receptacle of the piistillate Fig is fully devel- 
 oped, when entirely free from any staminate influ- 
 ence. Whether the receptacle of the Strawberry ever 
 enlarges, without the- pistils being fertilized, (as al- 
 ready stated,) is more than I can tell; but I feel well 
 assured, that any competent authority, who may fur- 
 nish the information, will make an acceptable con- 
 tribution to physiological Botany. w. v.

To THE Editors oe the Farm Jourx.vl: — 

I have 
 perused an article from Thomas Meehan, in your last 
 number, which seems to be evasive, and does not at 
 all satisfactorily meet the question at issue. Ilis 
 first statement made in your April number, was that 
 "Ilovey's Strawberry," "usually classed as a pistil- 
 late," ''did become a staminate by being forced slow- 
 ly in a moderate temperature." 

In rep.y, I did not merely declare such a result to 
 be utterly impossible, but / gave my reasons ilierefor. 

I furthermore called for the proof of Ilovey's 
 strawberry having produced fruit "without the possi. 
 Me connection of some other variety naturally stami- 
 nate. 

In Mr. Meehan's reply the name of "Ilovey's 
 strawberry" j.s not even mentioned, but he speaks of 
 twelve runners taken from pistillate plants, of which 
 seven produced perfect flo. vers and five pistillates, 
 and that these twelve plants produced fruit. Com- 
 prising as they did, plants of both sexes, it would have 
 been a miracle if they had not produced fruit. But 
 the whole of those twelve runners were never ob- 
 tained from the genuine Ilovey's seedling strawbei-- 
 ry, nor from any oilier single variety. They were 
 runners from two distinct varieties (intermixed inad- 

vertently without doubt.) I do not question that 
 Mr. Meehan now supposes they were such as he 
 has stated them to be. It will be found, however, 
 on full investigation, that he commenced with a blun- 
 der of a similar description with that which con- 
 fused Mr. Downing, who had a totally difl'erent vari- 
 ety (a staminate one) under the name of Ilovey's 
 seedling. As to the supposed anomaly spoken of in 
 relation to McAvoy's Extra Red, and from which it is 
 deduced t' at this plant is also of a changeable char- 
 acter; it amounts to nothing more than to prove tliat 
 the writer is ignorant of certain characteristics of 
 that, and of at least a dozen other varieties, while it 
 can scarcely be deemed ruleable that he should pal- 
 liate one blunder by committing another. Their 
 character has already been commented upon by hor- 
 ticultural writers, and being fully so in an article 
 prepared by myself, and shortlj' to appear in the 
 Horticulturist, I forebear present comments. I will 
 merely say that their characteristics are as immuta- 
 ble as are those of every other variety of the straw- 
 berry, in none of which has there ever been any change 
 tohatever. 

Yours very respectfully, 

WM. R. PRINCE. 
 P. S. — I am willing to unite with Mr. Longworth, 
 of Cincinnati, in placing $1000 in deposit, to be paid 
 over to any person who will pi-oduce ouc perfect ber- 
 ry from Ilovey's Seedling strawberry, when grown 
 by itself, with or without heat. AV. R. P. 

The Penuock Corn Drill. 

We have equally favorable accounts as the follow- 
 ing, of the Pennock Corn Drill, from several of our 
 Chester county friends, who gave it a thorough trial 
 this spring. The advantages of drilling in corn are 
 so manifest, that this implement must soon come in- 
 to general use.

Mr. Editor: — 

I was tempted, by the notice in 
 your April number, to purchase one of Pennock's 
 new Corn Drills, and its performance has given such 
 entir; satisfaction, and so greatly exceeded my expect 
 tations, that I feel it a duty I owe the farming com- 
 munitj- to call their attention to this implement, that 
 they may take advantage of it another season. 

I have long been of the opinion that drilling in 
 corn will supercede all other modes of planting, as 
 soon as a real good drill is within the re.ach of every 
 farmer at a moderate price. And I do pronounce 
 the Pennock corn planter a real good one though not 
 perfect, as I can suggest what in my opinion, would 
 be an improvement, to wit: to arrange it so as to drop 
 regularly and without fail, o/c grain one foot apart. 
 This distance will allow more stalks on tlie ground 
 without being too dar, than any other mode of plan- 
 ting. The Pennock planter, as now constructed,
