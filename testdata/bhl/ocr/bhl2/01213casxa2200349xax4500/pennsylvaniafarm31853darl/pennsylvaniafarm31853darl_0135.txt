Farm.— This month and the lattci- part of the j, re- 
 ceding, embraces tiie period of hay and harvest, the 
 most critical and anxious fur the farmer of the whole 
 year. Activity, energy, judgment, as ■well as all 
 the physical help that can be mustered, will now be 
 wanted, and in one department or another, every 
 man, woman and child will be forced to turn 
 VOLUNTEER. As a conscquence, many things requir- 
 ing attention, as well as hay and grain, are apt to be 
 neglected, such as corn, potatoes, and all root crops, 
 and the vegetable garden. AVeeds are too frequerit. 
 ly allowed to hold possession and keep growing till 
 harvest is over, to the serious detriment of the crop. 
 Whenever practicable we think an extra hand, em. 
 ployed especially to kojp the cultivator going for a 
 mouth or sis weeks, would save much subsequent 
 labor, as well as secure a much heavier yield. -It is 
 highly important that there should be no cessation 
 of growth at this period, to prevent which, constant 
 stirring of the soil is indispensable. Hay should not 
 be made too mach in the lield, by frequent turning 
 over, and consequent drying, as used to be more cus- 
 tomary than now, much of the strength and quality 
 is thus impaired. Tiie free use of salt in the mow 
 or stack, will obviate danger fr.m heating. Grain 
 should be cut before being dead ripe, at least a week. 
 This has been fully proved, to make greater weight, 
 and finer quality of flour, as well as to make the 
 straw more valuable as, provender. If any ride can 
 be given for cutting, it is when the stem becomes 
 white and begins to shrink, just belo.v the ear, and 
 when the. grain on being pressed between the fing- 
 ers, is about the consistency of dough. 

As a drink for the harvest field, molasses and gin- 
 ger, with vinegar and water, in proportions to suit 
 the taste, are a wholesome substitute for alcoholic 
 stimulants, now generally discarded. Judge Buel 
 used to recommend oat meal and water, as a whole 
 some and cooling beverage for this season. ^ 

Ruta Baga crjp should be sown the first week in 
 this month, in ground previously well ploughed, pul- 
 verized and manured. 

Fruit Orchard. — Dig or plough ground between 
 strawberry rows, to keep down weeds, and allow 
 runners to take root freely. Continue pinching 
 and summer pruning process, for fruit tr::es, a.:, di- 
 rected in last month. The shape of the tree, as well 
 as number of fruit bearing branches, can tliua bo 
 easily regulated. 

Cut out superfluous growth of grape vinos, and 
 also slop the shoots containing bundles, to increase 
 their size. 

Summer pruning has been heretofore too much 
 neglected. The plain, common sense method, of 
 stopping the r/rowth of branches by pinching out the 
 terminal bud at the rreoise point required, and thin- 
 ning out superfluous shoots as soon as they ajijieai; 

instead of allo'n ing them to grow into limbs, to be 
 subsequently pruned or sawed off, thus making a per- 
 fectly useless waste of growth and vigor of the tree, 
 will commend itself to all. Pruning, properly un- 
 derstood, comprises much of the art of fruit grow- 
 ing. We have no hope .of its importance being ap- 
 preciated, till this has become more of a business 
 with farmers, than it now is. Judicious pruning 
 will then become as indispensable to be attended to 
 in proper season, as hoeing corn, sowing grain, or 
 c'eaning out weeds. 

General pruning of trees, where it has been ne- 
 glected in winter or spring, may now bo attended to 
 if there is time. We have found that at midsummer, 
 when the tree is in its full vigor, the wounds heal 
 over readily, and quickly without injury. In shap- 
 ing young trees, the plan of low heads, say five feet 
 from the ground, is to be recommended. This pro- 
 motes convenience of picking the fruit, and is high- 
 ly useful in shading the trunk from the effect of the 
 hot sun. 

The blight in Pear trees should now be watched 
 for, and the limbs amputated immediately below the 
 parts affected. We observe this season an unusual 
 amount of the slug on the leaves of the Pear tree. 
 Unleached ashes, or air-slacked lime, dusted over the 
 tree, is a certain remedy, to be repeated, if neces- 
 sary. 

Budding of Pears and Plums may be performed 
 this month, at any time when the bark separates 
 freely from the wood. If the weather is dry, and 
 there is danger sap may stop flowi 'g, before buds are 
 mature, cultivate and work the soil around the trees 
 to produce continued action of the sap vessels. 

Shake or jar quickly Plum trees every morning, 
 and collect for burning or feed to the hogs the fruit 
 which falls, containing the eggs of the curculio. 
 Were this plan adopted by all cultivators, the rava- 
 ges of the "little turk" would be sensibly diminish- 
 ed. Whenever practicable, hogs and poultry should 
 have the run of the fruit orchard, to eat up the fruit 
 which falls prematurely. 

Vegetable Garden.— Attend to directions of last 
 month. Transplant during damp spells of weather, 
 cabbages, cauliflower, celery, as before directed. This 
 latter should first be pricked out of seed bed, and 
 transplanted to a prepared piece of ground, before 
 final removal into trenches. Try salt for this crop. 
 Sow endire, small salading, summer radish, ruta ba- 
 ga seeds, &c. Plant cucumber seed for pickles. At 
 last of month some spinach and lettuce may be sown 
 for autumn use. 

Cut off and dry for use, such herbs as come into 
 flower. 

Peas maybe planted for Fall crop, also sugar corn, 
 for table use or marketing. 

The main turnip crop sh ould be planted in drills 
 the last of this, and the beginning of next month.
