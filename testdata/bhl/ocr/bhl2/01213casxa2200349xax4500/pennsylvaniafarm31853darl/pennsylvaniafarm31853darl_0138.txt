The first annual exhibition of the above Society 
 now fully organized, will bo held on the 15th, 16th, 
 and 17th of September next, in West Chester, at the 
 same time as the Horticultural Exhibition. From 
 the amount of improved stock, of all kinds in the 
 county, as well as manufactories of agricultural im- 
 plements, it is expected it will bo an interesting 
 affair. 

Soap Scads. 

The value of this liquid as a stimulant of vegeta- 
 tion does not appear to be generally appreciated by 
 our agriculturists, many of whom make no use of it, 
 although from their well known habits of enterprise 
 and economy in other matters, we sliould have been 
 led to expect better things. In a state of incipient 
 putridity, soap-suds is replete with the element of 
 vegetables, in a state of actual and complete solution; 
 the only condition, indeed, in which it is susceptible 
 of absorption and assimilation by the roots of plants. 
 Besides its value as a powerful stimulant, it possesses 
 also, very potent anthelmintic properties, and when 
 used in the irrigation of garden and field crops — the 
 best way, perhaps, in which it can be applied to 
 vegetables — operates as a speedy aud effectual reme- 
 dy, against the ravages of bugs, worms, and most of 
 the aligerous or winged depredators, by which veg- 
 etables are so often infested and destroyed. It is 
 also, a most valuable adjuvant in the formation of 
 compost. For this purpose a large tank or vat, 
 capable of holding from three to four cart loads, 
 should be constructed in some place easy of access, 
 aud to which, without difSoulty, the wash from the 
 sink and laundry can be regularly conveyed. Into 
 this reservoir all the wash matter produced on the 
 farm and about the mansion, should be thrown — 
 bones, refuse, ashes, muck, turf, rich soil, and chip- 
 manure from the wood-shed; in short, every substance 
 capable of absorbing the rich, fertilizing liquid, and 
 retaining it for the benefit of the soil and plants to 
 which it is to be applied. 

By a little systematic attention to matters of this 
 nature, the annual produce of our agriculture might 
 be immeasurably increased, and the productive ca- 
 pacity of many farms, now regarded as almost worth- 
 less, placed on a footing equal, if not superior, to 
 that of the most fertile. Nature has every where 
 supplied in munificent abundance the means of fer- 
 tility, and we have only to appropriate and apply 
 them judiciously, to secure the best and most flatter- 
 ing results. 

Some agricultural writers have estimated the value 
 of a hogshead of suds, in a state of incipient putrid- 
 ity, to be very near equal to that of a cord of prepar- 
 ed manure. This is probably an over estimate: yet 
 no one who has applied suds to vegetation, and care- 
 fully observed the results, can be otherwise than con- 
 vinced of its very great efficacy and value. Where 
 it is used in composting operations, it rnay bo applied 
 in its crude state, before fermentation has taken 
 place. It will ferment in the heap, and thus induce 
 a powerful chemical action in the ingredients, which 
 will be in proportion as to power, to their number 
 and character, and the manner or rather thorough- 
 ness with which they are intermixed. AVith a suffi- 
 ciency of soapsuds and urine, a valuable compost 
 may be made of any soil, even sand. — [Farmer and

Tea Culture. 

The Rochester American says, that a gentleman 
 who has carried on both the cultivation of the tree, 
 and the manufacture of tea from their leaves for 
 years, and some of the time employed two hundred 
 men at the work, has left that place, after an exten- 
 sive examination of the soil aud climate of the South, 
 for China and tlie East Indies, expressly to import a 
 stock of young plants, superior in every respect to 
 those cultivated Ijy the late Dr. Junis Smith, at Gren- 
 ville, South Carolina.
