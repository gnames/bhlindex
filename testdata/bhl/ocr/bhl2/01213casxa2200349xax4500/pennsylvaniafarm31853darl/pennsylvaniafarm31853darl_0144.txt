THE PRODUCTION OF BUTTER. 

[AdqcsT 

No 2. Cream only. 

With one exception I have inserted, more or less, 
 details of the various modes of makinp; butter; the 
 one to which I am about to allude is only, to the wri- 
 ter's knowledge, practised in the southern division of 
 Lancashire, and tlie county of Chester, and very lim- 
 itedly in Carlow. The practice alluded to consists in 
 dividing the milk into two portions, viz., the {greater 
 part of the first milk is set in tlie ordinary way to 
 stand for cream, the latter being usually taken off 
 quite sweet, and the skimmed milk sold, uaed for the 
 family, or given to the pigs, the latter part of the 
 milking, which is rich in cream, is at once put in a 
 vessel containing the cream of prior milkings; the 
 last drawn arc locally called "afterings;" in cold 
 weather the mi.xed cream and afterings are set near 
 the fire, in order to induce acescency, provineially 
 termed "soiling." The churn should be set at 58° 
 or 60°, and if smartly churned the butter will 'come,' 
 sometiraea within the hour, and rarely, if set at the 
 above temperatures, will it exceed one hour and a 
 half. In Lancashire, machinery is occasionally em- 
 ployed for cluirnlug, and was found advantageous so 
 long ago as ITO.'J. Mr. Thomas "Wakefield, of Brook 
 House, near Liverpool, employed a horse machine 
 for this purpose, by which he effected, with a horse 
 and boy to drive, in one hour and a quarter, what 
 was usually the work of two men for five hours.

The above quantities of milk were the produce of 
 six successive fortnights. 

If 20,110 quarts yield 1,109 lbs. of butter, how 
 many pounds will 25,056 quarts yield? Answer — 
 1271; thus showing 254 lbs. of butter additional pro- 
 duced by machinery. This favorable action of ma- 
 chinery is owing to the greater number of plunges 
 made within a given time, particularly when inani- 
 mate power like a steam-engine is employed, in which 
 case the exact number to every minute can be regu- 
 lated to the greatest nicety; forty plunges a minute 
 is found to be the most judicious rate. In large da- 
 ries in South Lancashire small steam engines for 
 driving churns are by no means uncommon, the same 
 power being also very serviceable for cutting chaff, 
 roots, &c. 

It has already been shown that milk is composed 
 of casein, butter, sugar, water, and a small amount 
 of inorganic salts; it has also been stated that the 
 covering of the fatty globules of the milk is dissolv- 
 ed by acetic or lactic acid; seeing this, it is easy to 
 conceive that cream or milk, a little acescent, will 
 "give" the butter with less labour in churning than 
 when the milk or cream is void of acidity. Milk, 

like the juice of fruits, such as the grape, apple, 
 pear, &c., contains the principal ingredients requisite 
 for the vinous fermentation, viz: sugar and a protean 
 compouml — soluble albumen^the latter liable to en- 
 ter into rapid changes when exposed to the influence 
 of the oxygen of the atmosphere: by which means it 
 becomes converted into a ferment, wliich has the 
 property of slowly, in the first instance, converting 
 the sugar of the milk into alcohol, which latter, by 
 further oxidation, is converted into lactic acid, the 
 lactic acid acting upon the coating of the fatty glo- 
 bules as previously noticed. This action invariably 
 takes place during warm weather, the original fer- 
 mentative action being .somewhat similar to tiiat of 
 the mode of brewing beer at a low temperature, as 
 practised in Bavaria. Dr. Lyon Playfair has, how- 
 ever, stated that in winter a difl'erent action takes 
 place, namely, that during cold weather the temper- 
 ature is not sufficiently elevated to cause vinous fer- 
 mentation, and that the action of the oxygen in the 
 first instance, at this sea.son, is confined to the casein, 
 in other words the putrefactive fermentation takes 
 place. It is impossible, therefore, to make good but- 
 ter from milk undergoing such a change as is here 
 named, for when incipient putrefaction has once 
 commenced, it cannot be arrested by ordinary means, 
 and is consequently imparted to the minute quanti- 
 ty of casein remaining in the butter, and is never 
 wholly extracted; such butter speedily becon'.es ran- 
 cid, even in winter, notwithstanding the low temper- 
 ature of that season is unfavorable to the promotion 
 of putrefactive changes. 

The reason why sweet cream requires less churn- 
 ing than cream and milk mixed, arises from the cir- 
 cumstances that in cream alone the absorption of 
 oxygen, which takes place at every agitation, is dif- 
 fused throughout a much smaller quantity of liquid, 
 the lactic acid formed is consequently much more 
 concentrated, and acts with greater energy on the 
 outer coating of the butter globules, butter, there- 
 fore, comes more quickly. It must be observed that 
 however sweet the cream may be, when placed in the 
 churn, butter is never formed until after the forma- 
 tion of lactic acid. In making butter, sweet cream 
 is a relative, rather than an absolute term, for in 
 fact acescency, commences within a few hours after 
 the milk has been set to stand. In endeavoring to 
 obtain butter from sweet milk alone, the labour re- 
 quired to form the butter is excessive, for in this in- 
 stance the quantity of oxygen that can be absorbed 
 through the influence of agitation is proportionally 
 decreased in the ratio of the increased quantity of 
 liquid throughout which the butter is diffused; whilst, 
 at the same time, a larger amount of oxygen is re- 
 quired in order to convert a portipn of the sugar of 
 milk into alcohol, and ultimately into lactic acid. 
 But in a closed churn a long time elapses before 
 these changes take place; consequently, we need not 
 be surprised to find that Dr. Traill and others failed 
 to obtain butter from sweet milk alone; yet on one 
 occasion the experiment was tried in Carlow, butter 
 was obtained from new milk under the inspection of 
 the writer, but it took upwards of five hours to pro- 
 duce it, and the butter was of inferior quality, hav- 
 ing all the characteristics of over-churned butter. 
 The reason why it is found requisite in practice to 
 churn milk and cream mixed at a higher tempera- 
 ture than cream alone, arises from the fact that tem- 
 perature has a marked influence in promoting chem- 
 ical changes. Reasons have already been assigned 
 why the lactic acid, formed in milk alone, must be 
 in a much more diluted form than that which will be 
 found in cream slightly aoescen in order to compen-
