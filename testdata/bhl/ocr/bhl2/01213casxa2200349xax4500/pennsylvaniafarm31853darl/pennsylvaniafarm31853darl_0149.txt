effect produced, as if by man;ic. Aa an additional 
 stimulus, Agricultural and Horticultural Societies 
 in different counties, might offer premiums to indl"

Extracts from an Address by P. Falconer, Esq., he- 
 fore the Warreii Cumitij Lyceum. 

In forming our plans we should get as near to na- 
 ture as we can, artificially imitating her in ponds of 
 water, spouting, sparkling or dripping fountain and 
 rock work, and to them may be added the devices of 
 vases, sun-dials, rustic chairs and arbors, and fail 
 not let me urge, to have your lanes, streets or parks 
 well divers. tied; and ever remembering the evergreen; 
 it affords, especially in winter scenes, tlie bewitching 
 charm ot more favored portions of the year. And 
 you find the arrangement in nature around you, 
 whatever direction you chance to look. Yes, blend- 
 ed together in groups sufficient to gratify the taste of 
 the erudite and fastidious. When the two great hu- 
 morists of the two respective hemispheres met at Ab- 
 botsford, Scott said to Irving, "the greatest desire I 
 have of seeing your country is to enjoy an uninter- 
 rupted full view of it in its primitive grandeur, and 
 sublimity, with the idea of thousands of miles of un- 
 trodden forests around mc." 

This privilege you enjoy at the small expense of a 
 short ride or walk, and yet rarely allow it a passing 
 thought, or admit its expanding influences, or relish 
 its enchanting pleasures, so much as many of the dis- 
 plays of man'sfancy, which are lauded totheskies. Tlie 
 pines take your fancy because they are susceptible of 
 making tirst-rate shingles, and first quality of boards. 
 The beautiful maples and hickories, because they 
 make excellent wood for fuel. The chestnut for their 
 nuts, and because they make the best of rails and 
 fence posts. And your admiration, shall I say it, 
 here ends. 

To those who have never planted a tree, if there 
 are such here, let me entreat of you again to redeem 
 the time, and to you that fell the forest, spare some 
 kind memento from the fell destroyer, and listen and 
 hear those 

. ''ToQgues in the trees— books in the running broolis. 
 Sermons in stones— und good in everything." 

The other branch of the subject may be defined as 
 villa or suburban gardening. And this is something 
 almost all claim to be interested in. 

Holding still to the untiiiling designs and princi- 
 ples laid down in nature, we might sum up this di- 
 vision of our subject by calling it a miniature of the 
 former ; the delicate arrangements of which, in 
 flowers and shrubs at least, are under the gentle care 
 and nice discriminating faculties and perfections of 
 the more gentle hands of the ladies. Well does it 
 become them thus to lavish their graces and gratify 
 their tastes. The flower beds may be so placed as to 
 gratify the taste of the owner. We greatly prefer 
 this to the stiff and studied copyright of some lead- 
 ing personages. We would greatly prefer more in- 
 dividuality, or originality about each place. Tliere 
 is too little of this in all other matters, or a number 
 of them, at least, than ought to be. Some things 
 might be laid down for the guidance of all, in refer- 
 ence to the proper display or effect. The large 
 ghruljs and flowering plants should always occupy 
 the back ground near fences or other objects, which 
 we may wish to hide from view. In the open ground 
 they should occupy the centre of the group, tliC less- 
 or the next, and the ros3s and moss may close up the 
 appy clustered conical form. Then you will be 

able to see the full effect or influence of all ; the 
 blending of the varied hues of the whole, having re- 
 spect always to their season of full flower. The 
 fountain according to the style best adapted to the 
 supply of water — dripping in case of a small supply, 
 and spouting and sparkling in more favorable sup- 
 plies and localities. 

Your hills teem with abundance of the element. 
 The town might have a pulilic fount, in some central 
 place, whose waters might, after making their dis- 
 plays, bo converted at will when necessary to allay 
 the consuming elements, besides affording a beautiful 
 public resort, with a little attention to the decoration 
 of the place, by a few flowers— many of the beauti- 
 ful fiimilies of plants love tn near its approach and 
 show acknowledgements in their blushing faces. 

There are two things we desire to see avoided — the 
 mole hill system, and the stiff, straight, unnatural 
 walks. The smooth level surface for the bed and 
 sweeping curves in the walks, serpentine if you choose, 
 are to be much prefe)Ted. To those who deprecate 
 any thing whose merit they think is only for orna- 
 ment, we would merely say, plant your yard or lane, 
 if any you have, with the dwarf bearing fruit trees, 
 and of those the dwarf pear is by no means to be dep- 
 reciated; they are both rich and beautiful, especially 
 when loaded with their rich fruits, and your since- 
 rity will be respected. If you object to the fountain, 
 let us only say the cranberry thrives well by its side 
 and seeks its humid influences. To us, both tliese 
 combined would be less exceptionable. Who does not 
 feel well remunerated forany thing he propagates and 
 rears, even if he could pro'cure it for a less equiv.a- 
 lent? There is a peculiar relish given to it, gratify- 
 ing to the eye. and delicate to the taste — there is a 
 filial affection springs up that knows no change. 

Ape not too much after the foreign plants and 
 flowers, as for the French fashions, but lay hold man- 
 fully of the productions of your own vallies and hills, 
 and you cannot fail to be well supplied. We mean not 
 to be understood as despising foreign things, but des- 
 pising merely those tastes for thera, simply for no 
 other reason than their -birth and origin, and not their 

merit.- 

"Is therp Tio mdrai beauty 
 ] n the bosom of a rose ?" 

What has nature left unfinished in Warren ? The 
 picturesque beauty of its scenery and its gr.and pan- 
 oramic hills, shown by moonlight— I fear many an 
 eye now looking on it that has had this privilege fin- 
 years, and some from earliest visions formed — would 
 be disappointed were the artist to reduce it to the 
 canvass and having enticed you to this house, or 
 James' Hall by blazing bills to view an Italian scene, 
 would go home without making the discovery that it 
 was his own home. 

Weeping Willows. 

It is said that all the Weeping Willow trees in this 
 country and England, originated from a twig set out 
 by Pope the poet. He received a present of figs from 
 Turkey, and observing a twig in the basket, he set it 
 out in his garden, where it soon became a fine tree. 

Bedford County Agricultural Society. 

We observe by the Bedford Inquirer that, the sec- 
 ond Agricultural Fair, in this flourishing county, 
 will be held in the town of Bedford, on the 18th and 
 19th days of October next. The list for competition 
 is extensive, and the premiums quite liberal.
