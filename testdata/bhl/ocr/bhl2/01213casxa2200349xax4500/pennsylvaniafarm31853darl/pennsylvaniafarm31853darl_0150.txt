I,?6 IMPROVED CIDER MILL— LANDRETII'S SEED FARM— PRESERVING FRUITS. [August 

Hictok's Improved Portable Cidcir Mill. 

Under 1 existing Patent and 2 Pending Applications. 

The accompanying figure represents aoompact and 
 effective machine, the whole being contained in one 
 frame 2} by 3 feefc.and 4 feet high: the whole weighs 
 300 pounds. 

This machine, attended by 2 men, when properly 
 worked, according to directions, is said to make 6 to 
 12 barrels of cider a day, and will grind alone by 
 Jiorse-power from 100 to 300, bushels of apples a 
 •Jay. 

Tlio peculiar arrangement of the cylinders is siich 
 that no description of apples will clog it up, but it 
 i.illatall times work free and fast— qualities it is 
 believed no other machine possesses. 

Seed Farm of David L,aiidretli. 

We observe in the Germantown Telegraph, that 
 the "Farmers Club" of that vicinity, have recently 
 had their monthly meeting at "Bloomdale," the resi- 
 dence and Seed Farm of David Landreth, of Phil'a. 
 The extent of ground devoted entirely to the raising 
 of seeds, over 200 acres, as well as the care and ac- 
 curacy observed in ther growth and preservation 
 have given this establishment a high and well deserv- 
 ed reputation. "Landreth's seeds" are known and 
 esteemed everywhere. We observe he has this sea- 
 son 50 acres in Peas, which were about being har- 
 vested, to be succeeded by a crop of Beans, thus ob- 
 taining two crops froin the same ground. An order 
 of four tons of seeds was' lately shipped for British 
 India, and they are annually sent in large quantities 
 to California, New Mexico, South America, and the 
 West Indies. A pair of Norman Ponies; working 
 within 16 inches, are used for cultivating the drilled 
 crops. This establishment is the largest and most 
 complete in the United States. 

The press is provided with a heavy wrought iron 
 screw, and the pressing tub or bos is so arrange d 
 that as soon as the pressing is accomplished, it can be 
 opened in an instant and the pomace taken out, and 
 it closed as quickly and another charge put under 
 the screw. 

No straw or bag is used and the cider comes out 
 fast ancJ cie:'ir. Any boy of 14 years of age can 
 press as readily as a man. 

While it possesses all the advantages of the old 
 style press, it has none of its faults. One quart or 
 one barrel can be made anytime it suits the owner 
 to use it, and it can be worked by hand or horse 
 power. Manufactured by W. 0. nikok,IIarrisburg, 
 Pa., and for sale, see advertisement. 

Preserving Fruits in tlieir own Juice, 

As the season of fruits is now approaching, it may 
 be interesting to our lady readers to be informed of 
 a motliod by which the most delicate fruits can be 
 preserved so as to retain their flavor for an almost in- 
 definite period. Thirteen bottles of fruit so preserv- 
 ed, were exhibited lately at Rochester, New York, by 
 William R. Smith of Wayne county, viz: five of 
 cherries, two of peaches, one of strawberries, three 
 of different varieties of currants, on? of blackberries, 
 and one of plums. 

They wore examined by a committee, and found of 
 fine flavor; and the committee expressed the opinion 
 that the art of preserving fruit in this manner is prac- 
 ticable, and that the fruit when carefully put up, can 
 be made to keep as long as may be desirable. 

The method of preserving is thus given to the New 
 York State Society by Mr. Smith: 

Thoy are preserved by placing the bottles, filled 
 with the fruit, in cold water, and raising the temper- 
 ature to the boiling point as quicklj' as possible; then 
 cork and seal the bottles immediately. Some varie- 
 ties of fruit will not fill the bottle with their own 
 juice — those must be filled with boiling water and 
 corked as before mentioned, after the Surrounding 
 water boils. — [Southern Cultivator.
