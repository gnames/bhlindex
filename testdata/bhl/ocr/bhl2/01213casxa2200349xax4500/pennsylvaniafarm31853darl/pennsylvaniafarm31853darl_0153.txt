heap must be well attended to. The refuse materi- 
 als for the barn yard must be collected and econo- 
 iTiised. Under a proper si/.ilem.,t\ie sale of hay will not 
 exhaust the soil so much as the sale of grain. On 
 returning last fall from the State Fair in company 
 Tvith some farmers, we found at various points along 
 the line of the railroad between Philadelphia and 
 Lancaster, -hay, was worth only $8 or $10 per ton, 
 while it was readily bringing in the city $22 to ^25. 
 There are many places in the State, convenient to 
 public improvements where a portion of the hay 
 crop might be spared to good profit; and to such we 
 introduce the above Press. Sown corn fodder will 
 yield in weight as well as nutriment, far more to the 
 acre than grass, and it will have to enter into our ro- 
 tation crops, and form part of our system of farm 
 management, in certain parts of Pennsylvania to a 
 mucii greater extent thaa heretofore. 

Seckle Pear ou Apple Stocks. 

Some of the delegates, last fall,to the American Po- 
 mological Convention at Cincinnati, from the Atlan- 
 tic States, report having heard in Ohio of considera- 
 ble succe'ss, and on a pretty large scale, of working 
 the Seclde Pear on Apple sfoclcs. Will the editor ol 
 the Western Horticultural Keview please inform us 
 about this ? The Seckle is proverbially a slow grow- 
 er in the nursery; and one of the varieties, too, not 
 destined to go out of fashion. The demand for good 
 sized trees has always exceeded the supply. If it is 
 an exception to the general rule against working 
 pears on apple stocks, and has been found to grow 
 tvith the apple, and make a permanent tree, it is a val- 
 uable discovery, and we should be glad to hear more 
 about it. 

Women's Rights. 

For the larm Journal. 

Mb. Editor: — 

Since the removal of the Journal to 
 West Chester, I think your female subscribers have 
 reason to complain that you do not dish up something 
 lor their entertaiumeut. You give us no poetry, no 
 sentiment, and hardly a receipt for cakes, puddings, 
 pastry or preserves. 

I have pored over the articles about lime, ana- 
 lysis of soils, raising root crops, and feeding them to 
 the cows and pigs, and long for something more live- 
 ly in addition to the other. 

I fear you do not believe in Women's rights, and 
 that this is an age of progress. I do not wish to 
 support a paper that don't keep up with the times, 
 We have rights, and we intend to maintain them, 
 even if we have to walk right up to the cannop's 
 mouth. Yours respectfully,

On receiving the above, particularly in reading the 
 liist sentenc«,although having tolerably strong nerves, 

we confess they were entirely unstrung. We imme- 
 diately procured a Cook Book, and insert some re- 
 ceipts, and. also a piece of poetry, which we hope 
 will be satisfactory to our fair correspondent, for this 
 month, if coupled with a promise to be more atten- 
 tive to her sex hereafter. The spirit she displays 
 carries us back to the days of the revolution. The 
 husband, or sons, of such a woman, who would hesi- 
 tate a single instant, about buckling on armor for the 
 contest, would deserve to be pitied. They would be 
 between two fires. 

In respect to the insinuation, that we are opposed to 
 women's rights, 'we must pleads innocent to that 
 charge. We have alwfiys been a strong advocate for 
 women's rights, and long before there was such an 
 excitement on the subject. We think they h.ave an 
 indisputable right to attend to the domestic affairs of 
 the household, to teach the childr3n, and either make 
 or superintend the making of good wholesome bread, 
 pies and cakes, darning the stockings, and a thousand 
 other things, that the active out of door business of 
 their husbands and brothers prevent them from at- 
 tending to. 

We hope no one will attempt to rob them of their 
 rights, and certainly shall not ourselves.

 Agricultural Review, No. 5. 
 Hay, from artificial grasses, fourth, fifth and sixth 
 in rotation is the most essential crop, and basis of in- 
 creasing fertility, upon the state of its product will 
 much depend the thriftiness of both working and 
 feeding stock. It is almost all consumed by these in 
 the township. The yield,both quantity and quality is 
 greatly influenced by the manner of seeding the 
 grasses; this is universally done upon the wheat, and 
 two ploughings for this is becoming more customary, 
 (as well as larger quantities of grass seed) from the 
 increased advantage to the succeeding hay crops. 
 Timothy, phleum pj-aiense is sown at the time of 
 wheat seeding,four to six quarts per aore,and covered 
 by the last harrowing or by rolling. Clover is sown 
 four to six quarts, as soon as the frost is out in the 
 Spring. The first year after wheat, clover will 
 greatly predominate, this by many is not considered 
 as valuable as timothy, hence the practice adopted 
 by some of pasturing one year previous to mowing. 
 Others value it for fiome Kse quite as highly as timo- 
 thy, though it will not bear handling and carriage 
 to market as well, were this the object; in fact its val- 
 ue is mainly dependant upon tune of cutting and 
 method of curing. The writer's'practiee is to cut in 
 full bloom, if tho weather is fair, cut one forenoon, 
 let it lay in swath until tho dew is entirely off the 
 next day, then spread it out evenly; the latter part of 
 the afternoon horse rake it into winrow, if pretty dry 
 heap it loosely, if not let it lay until the dew is off 
 next day, then turn or heap, and haul in the after-
