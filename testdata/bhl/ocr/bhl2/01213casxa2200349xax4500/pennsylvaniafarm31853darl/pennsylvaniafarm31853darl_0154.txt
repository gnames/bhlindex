hood; if rain threatens to intervene, place in large 
 well shaped cocks. But no fixed rule can be found 
 for curing hay, the plan must vary with the yield, 
 state of weather, temperature of the air, ground, &c. 
 The second crop is frequently cut for seed, this is 
 done with the cradle throwing two swathes togeth- 
 er, about the Ist of 9th month, is exposed to the 
 weather about two weeks. When well dried, housed: 
 and either thrashed by clover machines attached to 
 horse powers, or the heads separated from the stems 
 by flail, and taken to clover mills. Yield about three 
 bushels per acre — average price $5 50. 

Saving clover seed is exhausting and injui-ious, as 
 many of the plants die, after maturing seed, which 
 otherwise would have retained vitality another sea- 
 son. 

The second year, fifth in rotation, there will be 
 about an equal admixture of both grasses, the hay 
 from this is mostly preferred. 

The third year, or sixth in rotation; timothy will 
 gain the ascendency, this is considered most nutri- 
 tious to be cut when beginning to seed, it is usually 
 spread directly after the scythe, raked in winrow 
 towards evening, heaped and hauled in the next day. 
 As a market hay it commands the highest price, and 
 is more highly esteemed by farmers generally than 
 clover; sufficient of the best grass is reserved for seed 
 for home use, by all, and occasionally whole fields 
 are taken for seed; cut with the cradle from two to 
 three weeks later than the hay, or when the riper 
 heads shell freely to the touch; bind in small sheaves, 
 and leave them exposed to the weather in open 
 shock, about two weeks, then thrash by flail, yield 
 from two to four bushels per acre — average price $3. 
 If the season is dry, timothy affords little aftermath, 
 clover ivithstands the effects of the drouth much befr 
 ter. 

Watered meadow banks, which were in vogue and 

highly prized 50 to 100 years ago, have mostly been 
 abandoned, owing to the great care and attention 
 necessary to be devoted to them, though there is no 
 doubt the product is greatly increased by irrigation. 
 The average yield of hay per acre, is about \\ 
 tons, though as high as 3 may be cut sometimes.

 Foot Rot in Sheep. 

Messrs Editors: — 

Can you inform me of any sure 
 remedy for disease in the feet of sheep, I believe 
 sometimes called rot. It commenced in the first place 
 with lameness in one or two, at first slight, but has 
 increased so rapidly that some of them actually feed 
 down on their knees, and I fear it is going through 
 the whole flock. The foot, on examining, is quite 
 hot, the hoof soft, with a fetid excretion, particular- 
 ly between the cleft. It impairs their condition very 
 much. If you know of any cure, please inform 
 through the Farm Journal, for the benefit of your 
 subscribers, and perhaps many others.

The disease alluded to above by our correspon- 
 dent, is familiarly known by the name of foot rot, or 
 hoof ail, similar perhaps, to what is called foul claw 
 in cattle, although we have not observed the latter so 
 contagious in its character. The foot rot in sheep, is 
 one of the most painful and troublesome diseases 
 they are subject to. The fore feet are generally at' 
 tacked. II. S. may be assured it will spread through 
 his whole flock, if not speedily arrested. We hap- 
 pen to have had some experience with it, and will 
 state what we found entirely effectual. 

A single sheep lame with the disease, purchased 
 out of a drove, will communicate it in a short time 
 to a whole flock previously free. The proximate 
 cause is often -low, soft and marshy pastures, produ- 
 cing sponginess and unsoundness of the hoof. 

The first step should be to remove the sheep to 
 high and dry pasture, separate at once, and keep the 
 diseased sheep entirely apart from the others, both 
 day and night. They should not even be in adjoin- 
 ing fields. Examine the hoofs carefully, and pare
