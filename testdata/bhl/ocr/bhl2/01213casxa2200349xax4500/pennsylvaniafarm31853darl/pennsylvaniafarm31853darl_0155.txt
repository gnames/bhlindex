away all diseased portions, with a sharp knife. Probe 
 it into any loose or discolored places, to the sound 
 parts, even though it should bleed. This paring and 
 scraping must be thoroughly done. AVhere the dis- 
 ease has progressed far, maggots will often be found. 
 The foot being entirely cleaned and scraped, chloride 
 (Butyr) of antimony should be applied, as a caustic, 
 and repeated after daily examination, so long as 
 there is any unhealthy appearance. The sheep 
 should also be housed at night, on grouiid covered 
 with lime, (the fresher the better,) which should be 
 cleaned oif every morning, and the lime frequently 
 renewed. In very bad cases the foot should be kept 
 tied up. In rainy weather they should be Jsept un- 
 der shelter, as wet greatly promotes the progress of 
 ' the rot. We imported a lot of sheep one season, which 
 from improper treatment on board ship, were badly 
 affected "with the rot, but by perseverance in the 
 above plan, were finally cured. Sometimes paring 
 the foot closely, and applying hot lime alone, will be 
 sufficient, in the early stages.

 Guaun, Super Phosphate of I.ime and Cbappel's 
 Fertilizer, for TVh^at. 

J. Lacey Darlington, Esq. 

Dear Sir; — Last fall I cut 
 two acres of corn off to seed down wheat. Part of the 
 land was a mellow loam, and part of it stony—the 
 stone a gray sand stone, I measured it off into 
 three pieces — two pieces half an acre each, the other 
 one acre, in the middle, and drilled in the wheat 
 with one of Moore's patent grain drills, the first week 
 of October. On one half an acre I sowed 150 pounds 
 Peruvian Guano before plowing; on the other I sow- 
 ed ICO pounds of Super Phosphate of Lime one week 
 after the wheat came up; and on the onq acre piece, 
 600 pounds of Chappell's fertilizer before drilling 
 the wheat in. The Guano cost .?4 50 cents, besides 
 preparing it for use. The Super Phosph.ite l?4 80 
 cents, and the Fertilizer §8 GO, cents. Thqrewas no 
 manure of any other kind put on either piecje. .For 
 want of barn room I did not cut, and put each lot 
 separate; I cannot therefore state the yield as accu- 
 rately as I would like. Last fall I could see very 
 little difference in either piece, but in the Spring 
 the Guanoed piece had a darker green appearance, 
 and was thicker on the ground than either of the 
 other pieces, When the wheat came out in head the 
 Guano piece was about four inches taller than the 
 Others, and those who helped cut it with myself say 
 there is about one-third more to the ground, than on 
 either of the others; the wheat better filled, and a 
 better yield of straw. 

Last fall 3 year I plowed in IGO pounds Guano on 
 three-fourths of an acre of corn stalk ground, where 
 I had corn two years in succession, the ground in- 
 clined to clay, and where the com was the smallest 

in the field. On a half acre, rather better land, I 
 plowed in six large ox cart loads of horse stable 
 manure, kept under cover; the land was also manur- 
 ed in the Spring for the second crop of corn. ^ e- 
 tween these two pieces I could see no difference in 
 the wheat when out, except that the manured was ri- 
 per two or three days sooner, owing, I suppose, to 
 the land being higher. The guauo in both cases 
 showed itself to the drill marks. 

My conclusion is that Guano is cheaper than ma- 
 nure for wheat, as it costs less per acre. AVe have to 
 pay §1 50 for an ox cart load of manure in West Ches - 
 ter, and haul it three miles, which is worth half a 
 dollar more. When I haul wood to West Chester, I 
 haul manure as a back load, or I could not haul it 
 fur that price. I would prefer good barn-yard ma- 
 nure to cither of the other three if I could make 
 enough on the farm for each field, But the farm be- 
 ing out of order when I purchased, I can't make 
 enough as yet, using, as I do, part of it for potatoes 
 in the Spring. I put some Pat.agonian Guano and 
 Super Phosphate of Lime, in the furrow for potatoes, 
 along side of manure this Spring, .^nd when dug I 
 may give you the results of the experiments. 

If you think this worth a place in your valuable 
 Journal, your arc at liberty to publish it- 

The kind of wheat raised was the Mediterranean, 
 drilled one bushel and three pgcks per acre.

Having completed ray dwelling 
 house, 40 by 35 feet, 3 stories high, of stone, as wel! 
 as grading and leveling of the grounds adjacent, I 
 am now prepared for planting the coming fall, and 
 wish for your opin'on and advice as to a good selec-^ 
 tion of evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubbery, 
 of which I am entirely ignorant. By my estimate 
 of over two acres there is room for 150 trees and 50 
 shrubs, not one of which'is n')w growing. The site of 
 the buildings was selected for its elevation and com- 
 manding view. I want as much variety as is consis- 
 tent with good taste, and where practicable,especial'- 
 !y with the shrubbery, a su ccession of bloom, from 
 spring till fall, and such threes as are not especially 
 liable to insects. Can you assist me? 

Very truly, your subscriber,

In reply to our. ccrrespondent, we will give a list 
 of such as we should plant ourselves, and could da 
 it rather better if we knew of the exact si taation of 
 the ground, whether much of a slope or not, and al- 
 so of the surrounding objects, whether any unplea- 
 sant sights near or distant,are to be obscured, or any 
 agreeable views to be opened. This, however, must
