ou's system, to judge tho quality of cows, could give 
 tis more substantial information than English herd 
 books of pedigree with pompous names. I see in 
 the list of premiums of the State Agricultural Soci- 
 ety, a premium for Ilolstein Cattle. There is no such 
 thing as a particular Holstein breed. Fine cat- 
 tle are found at the mouth of the Elbe, the .same as 
 you find the Normandy cattle, the finest in Fra,nce,at 
 the mouth of the Seine, as you Tctire' from the rich 
 borders of tho Elbe into the interior of Ilolstein, you 
 fine the oa.tlc poor. The Ilolstein herdsman knows 
 nothing of pedigree, &c. To prevent breeding in, he 
 buys cattle at a distance, to cross his breed and 
 renovate his stock. When it has enjoyed that extraor- 
 dinary rich pasture for a while it becomes Holstein 
 cattle, and produces that fine fiavorous -butter po cel- 
 ebrated in Germany and England; which is not owing 
 to the particular breed, but to that rich soil whereon 
 the cattle pasture;

The prospect of an abundant fruit crop through- 
 out most of the fruit growing regions of this country 
 have scarcely ever been better, according to the best 
 information we can obtain, than they are the present 
 season. Everything looks promi.«ing. Last seasen the 
 crop was very ligiit generally— in many localities a 
 total failure; and this will contribute much to the 
 abundance of this season's crop. 

Now we wish to offer a few hints in regard to cer- 
 tain precautions, which the circumstances call for; 
 that is, provided the crop will bo as heavy as we 
 have reason to anticipate. It is very 'well known that 
 in favurable seasons, after a failure especially, trees 
 bear too much. It is very common to see them so 
 loaded with fruit .as nut only to ce.ase growing en- 
 tirely, but to bend and break down under its weight. 
 This should be guarded against. Trees are in a mul- 
 titude of cases enfeebled, broken, contract diseases, 
 aue are, in short, ruined by excessive bearing; and 
 evei'y man who appreciates the value of a full grown 
 bearing Iruit tree worth from JilOO to §500 as the 
 case may be, should guard against such a result as 
 carefully «s he would his ox or his horse against ex 
 cessive labor that would be certain to injure or kill 
 them. 

Trees, like animals, have constitutions that can by 
 proper treatment, be kept sound for a great length 
 of time,or by neglect or bad treatment broken down. 
 Our opinion is that the feeble, diseased, and short- 
 lived comlitlcjn of the peach tree in New Jersey is 
 due, in a great measure, to a greedy or careless sys- 
 tem of ()Ver-cropping. AVe know how races of men 
 and horses degener.ate, from bard labor and bad 
 treatment — how they dwindle down in si7.e,lose their 
 proportion, symmetry,, and intelligence — in short, 
 wear out, to use a very common but expressive term. 
 Trees "wear out," too. How many we have all seen 
 that in their youth, even before they had arrived at 
 a full bearing age and size, began 'to look old — the 
 branches twisted and knarly, the bark rouih and 
 mossy and all covered with small, feeble, ill-formed 
 fruit spurs, loaded perhaps with small, worthless 
 fruit, not worth picking up. 
 Now those who desire to guard their trees against 

wearing out, must not be too greedy of a great crop. 
 They must master that natural reluctance we all 
 feel to pick oft" a portion of tho fruit. They must 
 thin them out so as to leave them evenly distributed 
 over the tree, and only so many as can be brought to 
 full and perfect maturity without injury or death to 
 to the trej. But we shall be asked, "How are we to 
 know how many we ought to leave or how many to 
 take?" Well, wc confess it takes some little skill 
 and experience to thin a cropjudiciously, but he who 
 goes about it in earnest will find some indications to 
 aid him. It will not do to thin in all cases alike, be-- I 
 cause the vigorous tree, in a generous soil, will car= j 
 ry a large crop without injury, and that would bo 
 almost certain death to a delicate or feeble tree hav- 
 ing limited resources in the Way of Jhod, just as a 
 healthy, robust, well-fed man can perform a day's' i 
 work with ease, that a Weakly, ill-fod man dare not ' 
 attempt. Tho growth of a tree, the appearance of 
 its foliage, the lergth and thickness of its young 
 shoots, afford a very reliableguide as to thevigor of a 
 tree and its .ability to bear a heavy crop. Some vari- 
 eties are naturally moderate and constant bearcrS) 
 and if kept under good culture might never require 
 thinning, while others bear enormously some years, 
 the fruit actually covering every part of the tree and 
 requli'lng props and supports to keep it from being 
 torn to pieces. Such trees cannot bear so in succes- 
 sive years, nor can they long remain healthy. Then 
 beside thinning the fruits, good culture must be given 
 them in their fruitful years, and top-dressings of 
 compost in a well-decayed state. Garden trees may- 
 have liquid manure and mulching instead of top- 
 dressing. Such care as this, not costing much, will 
 not only sustain the vigor .and health of trees, but 
 produce large, handsome, marketable fruits. When 
 a tree is loaded to breaking down, one-half or three- 
 fourths of the fruit is worthless, and all the advan- 
 tage of a large crop is lost. 

We consider this subject of much importance to 
 the fruit grower. V/e know by ample e.^perience that 
 it is. We crop our own trees heavily, perhaps too 
 heavily: but every season we have to perform a thin- 
 ning process, and \fo should consider the neglect of 
 it nothing less than the wilful destruction of our 
 trees. — Genesee Fanner. 

Weeril on the Potato Stem. 

An insect of the curculio family,described by S.i'^ 
 as Baridivs frinoia/us, was discovered some time ago 
 by Miss Morris, of Oerraantown, Pa., on her potato 
 stems, which were much injured liy it. Specimens 
 were sent to England to -ascertain if such an insect 
 had been found there on the potatoe. J. 0. West^ 
 wood states in the London Gardener's Chronicle,that 
 no weevil has been known to reside in its early state 
 on the Potato, and that the facts as stated by Miss 
 Morris are new to science. The weevil deposits its 
 eggs near the root of the leaf, whence he insect 
 works its 'Way down, eating out the pith till it reaches 
 the potato itself.— [N. Y. Agricultor.
