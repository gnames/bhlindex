GUAXO AND SUPER PHOSPHATE OF LIME.

with a mallet. The price of Guano varies from $45 
 to $50, according to tho supply in market. As to the 
 certainty of its effects, we consiJer it much mor cer- 
 tain than ordinary barn-yard manure, wliicli has 
 laid exposed to sun and rain all summer. Ouano 
 should be ploughed in as soon as practicable, after 
 being spread. Some farmers prefer mixing it with 
 an equal bulk of plaster. 

The subject of special manures, is now exciting 
 great attention. Without entering the field of scien' 
 tific controversy, as to whicli of the new fertilizers 
 now before the public is the best and cheapest, it 
 seems enough for us at present to publish such facts 
 and results from the use of one or more of them, as 
 are within our own knowledge. These are what are 
 wanted, and we hope our farmers will communicate 
 their experiments for the general benefit. 

James Pierce, of West Bradford, Chester county, 
 applied 300 lbs. of Guano to the acre, last fall, it was 
 ploughed in to the usual depth, and the wheat drill" 
 ed. Part of the field was dressed with the ordina- 
 ry quantity of barn-yard manure. The other cir- 
 cumstances, as regards soil, seeding, &c., were pre- 
 cisely the same. The wheat for the Guanoed portion 
 was at least three times gTcater than ,the other, and 
 fully equal to a third portion, which received the ma- 
 nure which had been kept under a shed, free from 
 exposure to the weather. 

Robert Miller, Westtown township,applied 300 lbs. 
 Professor Mapes' Super Phosphate of Lime to three- 
 fourths of an acre of wheat last Fall, costing him on 
 his place aboutSO- On several acresadjoining.heappli- 
 ed barn-yard manure in the usual quantity, and for a 
 tliird strip he purchased and hauled from West Ches- 
 ter, four miles distant, about the same bulk oi stable 
 manure. This latter he estimated, to cost on the 
 land §45 peracre. The wheat on both strips was 
 much better than where the barn-yard manure was 
 used, tho straw brighter and Stiffer, and on the parj 
 where the Super Phosphate was applied, the grass^ 
 was .decidedly better than on either of the_ olher.s. 
 Four, years ago, on the same farm, Guano was plough- 
 ed in for wheat, 300 lbs. to the acre, on alternate 
 strips. The grass this season, on the guanoed por- 
 tions, is more luxuriant, and much better than the 
 others, and can bo detected at a glance. 

Abraham Baily, near Parkersville, applied to his 
 wheat last fall, on difierent portion of the field, Gu- 
 ano, barn-yard mauure, manure which had not been 
 exposed, and Professor Mapes' Super Phosphate, of 
 Lime. The latter could not be obtained till the wT&eat 
 was up some three or four weeks, and was sowed on 
 the surface, and the thinnest part of the field. Tho 
 wheat on it was efiual to where the shed manure had 
 been put, and ihe grass,, wherever it had been sown, 
 or even dropped in different places, for experiment, 
 was so far superior to all other parts,as to be observ- 

ed at a distance, before combing on to the ground- 
 We walked over this field, and the difference was very 
 striking. The wheat was heaviest, as the stubble in, 
 dicated, where 300 lbs. of Guano to the acre had 
 been used, but making all allowance for the differ- 
 ence in the soil, and time of applying it, not superi- 
 or, as the owner remarked to us, to that dressed with 
 the Super Phosphate, while the luxu-riance of the 
 grass on this last, seemed to give it the preference- 
 It was also used at the rate of 300 lbs. to the acre. 

Jonathan Gheen, of East Goshen, usedSOOlbs. Gu- 
 ano to the acre, and both wheat and grass are much 
 better from that portion, than where the best shed 
 manure was applied. The usual quantity of barn- 
 yard manure to the acre applied in Chester county 
 'is fifteen to eighteen ox cart loads. 

John Jackson, of East Bradford, sowed down with 
 wheat, one and one-fourth acres of corn stuble ground; 
 on one half he applied barn-yard manure, at the rate 
 of twenty ox cart loads to the acre. The balance he 
 dressed with 160 lbs. Professor Mapes' Super Phos- 
 phate of Lime, on this part the wheat was quite as 
 good as the manured portion, and some of it better. 

William P. Marshall, of ^est Goshen, informs us 
 that he top dressed a part of his pasture land last 
 Spring, with Professor Mapes' Super Phosphate of 
 Lime, at the rate of about 300 lbs. to the acre, — the 
 results of which are highly satisfactory — tully con- 
 firming the reputation of this fertilizer as a most ex- 
 cellent top dressing for grass. Upon the part of the 
 field where the Phosphate was sown, the grass grew 
 much more rapidly and vigorously than on the other 
 part — so much so, that the difference was plainly vis- 
 ible at some distance from the field. And what is 
 quite remarkable, the cows showed a very decided 
 preference for the grass on which the Phosphate was 
 sown, always passing directly to that part of the 
 field when turned into the pasture. 

Crops in I.ancaster County. 

Our old friend and correspondent "J. B. G." of 
 Mountville, Lancaster county. Pa., thus writes re- 
 specting the crops in his neighborhood ; "In this sec- 
 tion of our county,gras8 has made a full crop of hay. 
 Our winter grain, although considerably damaged 
 by the fly, has nevertheless turned out, we may say, 
 an average crop, and being much lodged was trouble- 
 some to harvest, — but having fine weather, was all 
 secured in good condition. The berry of the wheat 
 is very full and plump, and will make first-rate flour. 
 No mildew or rust attacking the straw. Our oat 
 crop never was better. Owing to a spell of dry 
 weather, our corn, potatoes, grass,garden vegetables, 
 &c., are suffering,^jut as the rains have commenced 
 to-day, we look for a renewal of vegetation. 

As to fruit, apples will be few, but we have cher- 
 ries, pears and peaches in abundance."
