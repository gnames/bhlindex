Dumping Wagon. 

The accompanying engravings represent an im- 
 priived Dumping Wagon, patented August 3d, 1852, 
 1852, by Mr. Thomas Castor, of Frankford, Phila- 
 dolphia county, Pennsylvania. 

This valuable improvement possesses many ad- 
 vantages over all the wagons of the kind hitherto in- 
 vented. It is becoming a great favorite among far- 
 mers and teamsters, and will eventually, in a great 
 me"^sure, take the place of carts, and the ordinary 
 farm wagon. It combines all the properties of a bur- 
 den wagon, with the facility of dumping its load with 
 much more ease than the ordinary cart. It is simple 
 in its construction, and therefore not so liable to get 

out of repair. The facilities of discharging its load 
 are not at all effected by an increase of weight. Mr. 
 William W. Smedley, of Whitehall, Pa., who has 
 been using it for some months, says that his team can 
 haul (and teamster dump) with as much ease G500 
 lbs. on the wagon, as 5000 lbs. on an ordinary cart. 
 And Mr. Minor Rogers, Aramingo, Pa., after hav- 
 ing given it a fair trial in hauling lumber, coal, wood, 
 stone, lime and various other heavy materials, recom- 
 mends it to the public as having exceded his expecta- 
 tions in many respects, particularly in the ease with 
 which heavy loads can be discharged. And all who 
 have yet tried it, recommend it for usefulness and 
 economy. The principle can be applied to burden 

cars for railroads, heavy os cart, or to burden wag- 
 ons, for any purpose, at a small additional cost. 
 Farmers and others are requested to examine its con- 
 struction, and try it for themselves.

A A are the front wheels, and B B the hind ones, 
 C C being the side timbers of the frame. D is the 

body, vvhich is balanced on anti-friction rollers, E, 
 which turn on a rod, extending across the frame, C; 
 the said rollers form a fulcrum and bearing for the 
 wagon body to rest upon and slide over, as heretofore 
 shown, and they are so situated in rotation to the 
 length of the wagon, that the body is balsBced upon 
 them in the manner of a scale beam, so that a small 
 weight upon either end will tip or tilt the other end
