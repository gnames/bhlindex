of the body. An outside plate, b, is bolted to either 
 side of the frame or pieces, C, and is formed with 
 hooks and stops, cd. The side timbers, e, are faced 
 ■with metal forming runners, or rails for balancing the 
 wagon body upon, and on which it moves over the 
 rollers. 

An anti-friction roller, /, is hung in the back ex- 
 tremity of both the side pieces, C, projecting slightly 
 above their top surface; upon either side of the body, 
 D, is braced a stop pin, g, which projects from the 
 side timber, e, and when the body, D, is brought 
 hojie for loading, as in figure 1, serves to determine 
 its proper position by striking and bearing against 
 the hooks, c. These pins also f jrm trunnions fur the 
 body to turn upon, in dumping the wagon, by catch- 
 ing within the lower hooks, a. A cam, h, is fitted to 
 work through either side piece, C; these cams are 
 mounted on a shaft extending across the frame, which 
 shaft is operated by the lever, t, so that on turning 
 the lever upwards, as in figure 1, and securing it by 
 a strap or catch, H, the cams,A, slightly lift the back 
 end of the wagon body, and support it, but when 
 the lever, i, is turned down, as in figure 2, the cams 
 permit the wagon body to descend and run backward: 
 II are lock-rods attached to discs or double cranks, 
 0, which are turned by the lever, m, and work longi- 
 tudinally to lock and unlock the body by sliding 
 through 0, within catches or openings formed on the 
 standards, m, as represented when it is desired to un- 
 load the Wigon, the lever, n, is turned, unlocking the 
 body of the carriage, and the lever, i, brought down 
 80 as to permit the body to fall upon the rollers, 
 when a slight pressure by the hand will carry the 
 body backward, and prepare it for unloading, which 
 is easily done by the hand. When unloaded depress 
 the body at n, and bring it to its place, then raise 
 the lever, i, and look the standard, m, and it is again 
 ready for re-loading.

A Chester County Hay Crop. 

Wm. Dripps, of Midway, in writing to us upon 
 other matters, mentions incidentally his crop of hay, 
 which is worth taking note of. lie siys, "all my 
 crops are heavy and have been got in, so far, in ex- 
 cellent condition. I had not over eighteen acres in 
 grass, from which we took off forty-nine large loads 
 of first quality hay — making over fifty tons. From 
 one of my fields which measured 9J acres with a 
 drill when the wheat was put in, we hauled off twen- 
 ty-nine large loads — over thirty tons of hay." 

This last field, it will be noticed, produced over 
 three tons to the acre ! ! While the whole eighteen 
 acres fall but little short of that yield. Our friend 
 Dripps furnishes a good commentary on his system 
 of farming, to say the least of it. 

Sale of the Earl of Ducie's famous Herd of Short 
 Horn Cattle in Knglaud. 

The Albany Evening -Journal of the 11th, states 
 that the subjoined circular was received that morn- 
 ing by the Secretarv of the State Agricultural Soci- 
 ety. The sale is to'takc place on the 24th and 25th 
 of August. The announcement will probably pos- 
 sess interest for our agriculturists, and we therefore 
 publish it. Catalogues of the animals will doubtless 
 be sent by th ; next steamer to the principal agricul- 
 tur.al societies of this country. 

The late lamented Earl Ducie having requested his 
 Executors to dispose of his Agricultural Stock, Mr. 
 Strafford has the honor to announce that he has been 
 favored with their instructions to sell by auction, 
 without any reserve, at Tortworth Court, Gloucester- 
 shire, on Wednesday and Thursday, the 24th and 
 25 th days of August next, the entire and far-famed 
 herd of Short-Horned Cattle, belonging to his Lord- 
 seip, consisti'ig of upwards of sixty head of Bulls, 
 Cows and Heifers, comprising the who'e of the just- 
 ly celebrated "Duchess" and "Oxford" tiibes of 
 Short lIorns,which,wlth the "Fourth Duke of York" 
 were purchased at the late Mr. Bates' sale atKirkle- 
 vington, in 1850 ; also, the "Duke of Gloster," and 
 many other promising young Bulls and Heifers bred 
 from them, as well as others from the most celebra- 
 ted herds in the kingdom ; with the splendid flock 
 of 800 South Down Sheep, bred from the renowned 
 stocks of His Grace, the Duke of Richmond: Col. 
 Kingscote, Capt. Pelhani, Messrs. Ellman, Barclay, 
 Harris, and others ; since which have been used the 
 very best Tups that could be obtained from Mr. Jo- 
 nas" Webb. Also, the unrivalled stock of Pigs, de- 
 scended from the most distinguished breeds in the 
 country. 

The character of the above stock may be estima- 
 ted from the fact that the originals of each breed 
 were purchased without the slightest reg.ard as to 
 price, and will be found to comprise some of the 
 most valuable animals in the United' Kingdom : as 
 such they are especially deserving the attention of 
 breeders in every part of the world. 

Catalogues, with the pedigrees and other particu- 
 lars, wilfshortly be issued, and may l)e had upon ap- 
 plication to Mr. Strafford,89 Guildford street,Russeli 
 Square.

Chicury. 

Our correspondent, F. A. Nauts, urges the cultiva- 
 tion of this plant, Cichorium Intybus. In th?s vicini- 
 ty, it is considered rather a noxious weed, which 
 the farmers are anxious to get rid of. We doubt 
 much if it will supply the place of a good cupof Ja- 
 va. Von Thaer speaks of one objection to it in En- 
 gland, that they can't get the plough deep enough to 
 destroy the roots when they want a rotation, and that 
 it spreads very rapidly. Before introducing new 
 plants, it is well to look at the facility of getting rid 
 of them, in case of disappointment as to their profit. 
 Dr. Darlington in his Flora Cestrica remarks, "it is 

justly r.anked among the unprofitable intruders."
