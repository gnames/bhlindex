 CultiTatiou of Strawberries. 

As the cultivation of small fruits is very properly 
 claiming the attention of farmers, residing within 
 convenient access to the large cities,it may not be im- 
 proper occasionally to record the result of careful ex- 
 periments whether successful or not, as such laud 
 mirks are more unerring guides for the uninitiated 
 than mere paper calculations. 

Strawberries being the earliest fruit to ripen, can 
 have no competition in the market, and under ordi- 
 nary treatment will yield large profits to the produ- 
 cer, though varjingin magnitude according to the va" 
 rietygrown, the quality of the soil, and the cultiva- 
 tion they receive! The kind most generally cultiva- 
 ted as a market crop is Uovey's Seedling, with about 
 one-teuth their number of large Early Scarlet, dis. 
 tributed throughout the plantation as fertilizers. The 
 McAvoy's Superior is a more vigorous and hardy 
 pistillate plant, and yielded a larger crop of large 
 sized berries,than any other that came under my ob- 
 servation this year. The Genessee and Cambridge 
 are hermaphrodite plants, and bore a full crop of 
 large early fruit, rfpening on the 28th of 5th month 
 last, and many of the berries measured trom 3 to 3J 
 inches in circumference; if they continue to be as 
 productive as they were this season, they will be val- 
 uable fertilizers. 

Having a variety of soil in cultivation, I ^have 
 grown strawberries on all kinds, from light blowinn- 
 sand to stiff timothy bottom, and have learned to 
 avoid either extreme, and now select a good loam of 
 medium texture, tolerably high and undulating, so 
 as freely to carry off the surftxoe water, cover it wit 
 manure, .which should be well incorporated with the. 
 soil; early in the Spring mark the rows 4 feet apart 12 
 to 15 inches distant in them. Putone hermaprodite to 
 every ten of the pistillates, rejecting the male or barre 
 plants which produce no fruit, but blossom and grow 
 vigorously, and soon over run and crowd out the 
 more fruitful ones. 

The beds should be kept mello \' and free from 
 weeds the first season, the runners carefully distrib- 
 uted over the ground so as to form the beds with reg- 
 ularity, after which but little culture is needed. I 
 use a subsoil plough, which mellows the alleys with- 
 out throwing earth on the plants, the benefits of 
 which are clearly shown, especially in a' dry season, 
 by the superior vigor and productiveness of the 
 plants near the edge of the beds over those in the 
 centre; the circumference extending from 12 to 15 
 inches o.~ either side, and the beds being three feet 
 in width, allowing one foot for alleys, the plants 
 nearly all receive nourishment-from the moisture and 
 atmospheric influence absorbed by the soil in the al- 
 leys thus deeply pulverized. 

In 1850 1 planted six acres of Ilovey Seedling on 
 the plan above described, in stiff clay land, one-half 

of which was low meadow ground, the other ascen- 
 ding to upland, from which were gathered and mark- 
 eted last year, over 300 bushels of fruit, but in the 
 latter part of summer the timothy and herd grass 
 proved better adapted to the low ground by taking 
 possession, and this year the strawberries there were 
 abandoned, and the grass mown for hay, leaving 
 three acres of upland in strawberries which were 
 dressed, viz: the alleys loosened with a subsoil plough, 
 and the stools of clover, weeds, &c., taken from the 
 beds and placed in the alleys, which served the 
 double purpose of retaining moisture and keeping the 
 berries clean; the yield was 154 bushels of fruit, for 
 which I received $4 per bushel, and paid 64 cents for 
 picking, and fifty cents (12J per. cent commission,) 
 for selling. Twelve dollars per acre would be a full 
 compensation for the little culture they received, ma- 
 king the account stand thus: 

To interest on 3 acres of land at §100, $18 00 

" culture, - - - - 36 00

 $616 00 
 $229 56 

$386 44 

Profit on three acres. 
 Equal $128 81 per acre. 

The first year the plants are set there is no returns, 
 but the value of the plants at the close of succeeding 
 years would be a full remuneration. Were I to'draw an 
 estimate from some of my specimen beds, a few rods 
 in length, which are thoroughly cultivatod,the results 
 above stated would appear like a failure, but for 
 large farmers, whore land is jilenty, and laborers 
 s6arce, the grertt question is not how much per cent 
 profit can be made on one acre, but by what mode can 
 the most clear money be made on all the land they 
 have to cultivate with the laborers at their command. 
 Over one hundred bushels of corn may be grown on 
 an acre of ground. Yet more clear money can be 
 made on twenty acres yielding fifty bushels each. 

One of my neighbors having but a few acres of 
 land devotes proper attention to something less than 
 three acres of strawberries, keeping the ground well 
 manured, mellow, and free from weeds, the expense 
 of which he has not been able to furnish, but he in. 
 formed me that he received over $1100 dollars for 
 the fruit this year.

 What is a Hovey's Seedling Strawberry? 

Sirs:— 

I dislike to occupy your pages with an ob- 
 jectless controversy; hence I have chosen the above 
 topic to write about. But first allow me to make a 
 remark or two on Mr. Prince's last effusion.
