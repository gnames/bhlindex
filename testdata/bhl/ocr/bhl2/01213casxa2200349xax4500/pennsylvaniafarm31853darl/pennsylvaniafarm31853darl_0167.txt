I am now charged with "evasion" and "ignorance." 
 AVell, thi.s is better than downright lying, with which 
 he charged me in his first; or in liis own words, with 
 making a statement as a matter of fact, which "was 
 utterly impossible." I am not without hope that by 
 another efibrt he will receive me into the company of 
 the dogmatic and insolent. 

Now, for the "evasion" first. But notice "his reas- 
 ons !" his "utterly impossible !" his "long experience 
 aiid never saw it, " his "changing a goose into a gan- 
 der!" "Evade" such arguments! I will let De 
 Grimm speak forme: "See here are arguments of ter- 
 rible force for children." But I did not mention the 
 "name of Hovey Seedling" in my last. In my first 
 I stated that from pistillate plants of Ilovoy's in pots, 
 (which I had marked) I raised runners, which pro- 
 duced some pistillate, and some perfect flowering 
 plants. In my second I again referred to the ex- 
 periment, but omitted for brevity sake, the mere 
 name. What a quibble to object upon! I shall soon 
 expect to hear of Mr. P. being engaged in a discus- 
 sion as to the number of angels that can walk on the 
 point of a needle. 

Mr. Prince may argue to all eternity that my 
 plants were not Ilovey's Seedling. I have no hope 
 of ever convincing him that it is not material wlieth- 
 they were or not. They were pistillates, and plants 
 with perfect flowers were raised from them. The 
 reader will please recollect that the plants were not 
 taken from a bed of plants in the open ground, in 
 which case they might have got mixed, but were ta- 
 ken from pistillate plants in pots, purposely for the 
 experiment, thus rendering any "blunder" generally 
 impossible. 

Have I cleared myself from "evasion ?" Then, 
 now for the "ignorance." 

I am "ignorant ttf the characteristics of McAvoy's 
 Extra Red, and a dozen other varieties." AVhere 
 did Mr. P. learn what I know about the "dozen oth- 
 er varieties ?" The arrogance that lifts a man up 
 to an imaginary bench, where the knowledge of oth- 
 er men can be judged, "without rule or precedent,"is 
 simply ridiculous. And as to the "supposed anom- 
 aly" of McAvoy's Extra Rod being well known, I 
 have a letter from Mr. Longworth himself, who rais- 
 ed that variety in his own garden, and under his own 
 acute observation, in which he states, that he never 
 saw any tendency of the kind in it, and never heard 
 of it till this season; and that it is the first instance 
 that has come under his observation of pistillate kinds 
 producing hermaphrodite flowers." 

Of course I don't expect Mr. Prince to place any val- 
 ue on Mr. L.'s word; an "utterly impossible" will do 
 in any case — except with the public. It must not be 
 inferred from the above extract, that Mr. L. agrees 
 with my views. He will pardon me for quoting him. 
 Though on "opposition benches," his stern love of 

justice would shield an other from an unjust attack. 

And now, sirs, what is Hovey's Seedling ? 

Mr. Prince parades with a flourish Mr. Downing's 
 attempt to prove what I have now done. Mr. Down- 
 ing's observations led him to the conclusion, that 
 Ilovey's would, by culture, become an Hermaphro- 
 dite. This was denied. To substantiate his state- 
 ment, }ie sent his platats to the Boston Society. They 
 decided that the kind was not Ilovey's because it was 
 a staminate. Mr. Downing could, of course, say no 
 more — to them; but to the day of his death, so far 
 as ever I could learn, he could never bo made to un" 
 derstand, that he "began with a blunder." 

I ask again, what is a Hovey's Seedling ? 

When it first came out, a friend of mine received 
 the first plants in Philadelphia, direct from Mr. Ho- 
 vey. Every care was taken with them, as the repu- 
 tation of the house depended on their accuracy. In- 
 numerable complaints came in after they were sent 
 out from this stock, that Hermaphrodites "were mix- 
 ed with them,"- and my friend could never be convinc- 
 ed of any thing than that the mixture must have taken 
 place in Mr. H.'s establishment; or (which he has 
 believed,) that the sexes change. 

Once more, what is a Hovey ? 

When a portion of one of my finest beds of Ho- 
 vey's Seedling, and which portion contained entirely 
 hermaphrodite flowers, were ripe, one of the strong- 
 est advocates of the sexual theory, came to see my 
 strawberries, I pointed out this portion, and told him 
 that I wanted him to name them. After a very care- 
 ful and close examination he pronounced them to be 
 "certainly Hovey's." I then told him they were 
 Hermaphrodites. He then replied that they could 
 not be Ilovey's, but must he Buist's I'rize. 

Now, gentlemen, do you understand what is a Ho- 
 vey's Seedling? 

"It is a strawberry that has a pistillate flower.'' 
 Show these gentlemen a plant with hermaphrodite 
 which you have raised directly and unmistakebly 
 from a pistillate plant — what then ? Not being a 
 pistiliate it cannot be Hovey. I admit this logic is 
 unanswerable. 

Then we have SIOOO offered to any one who can 
 produce "one perfect berry when grown by itself.'' 
 Who said they could do anything of the kind ? The 
 able article by "W. D." in your last, which so clear- 
 ly set forth my ideas, shows such a thing probable, 
 and the exact knowledge of whether that can be 
 effected or not, desirable. This is the only tiling I 
 have read in connection with the subject. Mr. Long, 
 worth's offer is not for any thing of the kind, but for 
 an hermaphrodite produc ed by cultivation from a pis- 
 tillate plant. 

There is something one can understand in an offer 
 like this. M. P.'s offer is really too magnanimous. 
 If his hobby horse cannot come off "first best," with.
