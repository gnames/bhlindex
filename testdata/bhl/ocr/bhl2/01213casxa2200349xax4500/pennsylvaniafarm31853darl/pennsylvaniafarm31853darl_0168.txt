Well let it go at that. 

So now -'Messrs. Editors," I have done with the

 it again.

Breeds of Fowls. 

For the Farm Journal. 

Mr. Editor:— 

A writer in the July number of the 
 "Journal" propounds "a few queries for fowl conno- 
 iseurs. 

The one as to "the origin of the so called Chitta' 
 gong fowl,and whether they may be considered a dis- 
 tinct breed, &c." Of course none but those engaged 
 in importing them can satisfactorily answer. For my 
 part I have seen some large and very fine collections 
 of the three breeds, viz: Shanghai, Cochin China and 
 Chittagongs, and I have never been able to discrimi- 
 nate so nicely as to point out the distinctive features 
 of the three breeds, and that there is really any verv 
 marked differenoe in them, is a question as yet un- 
 solved in my mind. 

I have had what were represented to me to be the 
 three distinct species, and when placed together in the 
 same yard, I could discover really no difference in 
 them. 

They are all represented as originating from the 
 same source— a wild fowl of China— and so far as I 
 am informed, derive their names from the respective 
 State from which they are exported, and in my hum- 
 ble opinion there is no distinctive features in either 
 of the three, other than those which persons interes- 
 ted in their traffic are pleased to fancy. 

The "boobies," alluded to by your cori-espondent, 
 as found in this section of the country, and which 
 were brought here by some of the early settlers from 
 Bucks county, bear little or no resemblance to the 
 pure Chittagongs. They are not so large, are very in- 
 ferior layers, and unlike the species that "display as 
 many colors as "Joseph's coat," are most generally 
 of a yellowish brown color. p.

their food, and about once every two weeks a little 
 flour of sulphur mixed with their meal, (this latter is 
 good for other complaints than gapes,) and let them 
 have their u-ater in shallow iron vessels. Tbey eat the 
 pepper greedily, and it appears to act thus far as a 
 sure preventive. 

I first saw it more than a year since in the Farm 
 Journal, and have tried it since then with the above 
 results.

 Gapes in Chickens. 

Mr. Editor: — 

In your last number, a correspondent 
 enquired for a remedy for gapes in chickens. I raised 
 sixty or seventy last Summer, and about the same 
 number this Summer, and have yet to loose the first 
 one from that cause

 D riUlng Wheat. 

Messrs. Editors: 

Having experienced great advan- 
 [ tagos on my own farm, from drilling wheat, over the 
 broadcast sowing, and as the time for seeding is ap- 
 proaching, I drop you aline on the subject, and if it 
 shall induce one or more farmers to try it, I shall 
 feel that I have done the State some service. The 
 difference in my field at harvest time, between the 
 two methods, was obvious to the most careless obser- 
 ver, being one third heavier in product, the other 
 circumstances being the same. The advantages of 
 drilling I understand to be: 1st. The grain is sown 
 and covered regularlif, none left near the surfiice to 
 be exposed and perish after the first settling rain. 
 2nd. It is covered deeper than with the common har- 
 row, and is not so liable to be thrown out by the win- 
 ter. 3rd. It takes a peck to half bushel at least less 
 seed, which alone will pay for the cost of drilling. 
 4th. From its regular distribution by the drill, it 
 comes up and ripens regularly and evenly, which is 
 very often not the case, when sown broadcast. 5th. 
 The open spaces between the drills afford a much 
 bettor chance for the grass seed. In every view of 
 the suhject, my experience and hundreds of others 
 proves it is true economy to have wheat drilled in. I 
 once heard of a farmer who had a drill offered to 
 him, to be paid for by the increased y\e\i of a field of 
 50 acres of wheat.certain portions being left through 
 the field broadcast, and the grower to determine the 
 difference to his own satisfaction. This increase iv.as 
 afterwards calculated to be 153 bushels. The ground 
 should be ploughed twice if possible.and put in nice 
 order by the harrow and roller before the drill comes 
 on the field. It is also important that none but a 
 first-rate machine should be used.
