Well mixed, and thicken sufficiently, then strain it 
 and pour it into the jars, and jvhen it has become 
 cool, cover the jellies with papers wet in brandy, cov- 
 er the jars tightly, and treat them as apple jelly. 

1 To Cook Parsnips. 

Persons who have never e.ateu parsnips cooked ac- 
 cording to the following mode, have no idea what an 
 excellent dish they are. Scrape the parsnips, wash 
 and slice them lengthwise; boil in just water enough 
 to cover them when thoroughly done. Then put in 
 a piece of butter, with a little salt and pepper. Beat 
 up an egg with a spoonful of flour and pour over 
 them — they are then ready to dish up. , , 

Parsnips are likewise very , good split once and 
 roasted with pork in the dripping pan. — [Exchange,

One and a half pints of pulped ruta bagas, two 
 spoonfuls of wheat flour, four eggs, half a pint of 
 milk, and one tablespoonful of butter. The pan 
 greased and floured, and baked with a quick fire. —

Blackberry Wine. 

Mr. Editor. — It may not be known to many of 
 jour subscribers tliat they possesss in the blackber- 
 ry, grown so unwil'ingly by them in their fields, the 
 means, at once, of making an excellent wine and a 
 valuable medicine for home use. To make a wine 
 ■equal in value to Port, take ripe bl.aokerries or dew- 
 Ijerries and press them, let the juice stand 30 hours 
 to ferment, skim off whatever rises to the top, then, 
 to every gallon of the juice, add a quart of water 
 <ind three pounds of sugar, {brown sugar will do,) 
 Jet this stand in open vessels for 24 hours, skim and 
 sstrain it, then barrel it until March, when it should 
 lie carefully ra«.^ked off and bottled. 

Blackberry cordial is made by adding one pound 
 of white sugar to three pounds of ripe blackberries, 
 allowing them to stand for 12 hours, then pressing 
 out the juice, straining it, adding one-third part of 
 spirit, and putting a teaspoonful of finely powdered 
 allspice in every quart of the cordial, it is at once fit 
 for use. 

This wine and cordial are very valuable medicines 
 in the treatment of weakness of the stomach and 
 feowels, and are especially valuable in the Summer 
 •complaints of children. 

As this is the season of such disorders, and as the 
 tierry will soon be ripe, I have thought it necess.ary 
 to make known theie receipes, — [Southern Planter. 
 Yours, &c., ECONOMIST. 

Farm Woric for the Mouth. 

AVeeds now require especial attention. The cul- 
 tivator and hoe, with the briar scythe should be plied 
 continually, around the fences, and among the corn 
 and potatoes, till they are all extirpated. They 
 should then be gathered and composted into a heap, 
 with ashes and some soil, and after being turned 
 over a few times, and well incorporated, will be a val- 
 uable addition next Spring to the manure heap. 

Late potatoes should be kept well cultivated, which 
 ebviates to some extent the effect of dry weather. 
 <jtround for wheat should be ploughed as soon as oats 
 is gathered, and allowed to lay till towards seeding 
 time, when Quaao or manure should be spread and 

ploughed in. Twice ploughing, and the consequent 
 fine pulverization, greatly facilitates the germiation 
 of grass seed, and enables the drilling to be much 
 better done. The advantages of drilling over broad- 
 cast sowing have been so fully tested, that it is pre- 
 sumed no good farmer will continue the latter, if a 
 drill can be obtained. Those who want to purchase 
 are referred to advertisements on cover. Much of 
 time after harvest and before seeding, is occupied with 
 hauling out manure. This should be spread evenly, 
 and ploughed in as soon afterwards as possible. 
 Much of the manure now taken on, may be compar- 
 ed to the dregs of tea, after repeated infusions to ob- 
 tain all its strength. The usual practice of letting 
 it lay exposed in yards all Summ-jr, open to sun and 
 rains, will have dissipated the best and largest por- 
 tion of its virtue. Wh.at little is left, had better be 
 saved by ploughing in at once. Turnips should now 
 be sown, on ground vacant from early potatoes, or 
 other removed crops. Drilling in rows will admit of 
 easier cultivation and management. 

Feeding cattle and cows suffer consider.ably this 
 month in their condition, from the dry weather and 
 torment from flies. Where they have access to shade 
 and water, to stand in and cool themselves, they 
 abandon the open fields during the heat of the day. 
 This matter of shade trees for stock, is too much lost 
 sight of by farmers. It is as grateful to them in hot 
 weather as us, and considerably promotes their thrift 
 and comfort. Milch cows now gener.ally fall off in 
 their milk, .and should have a portion of sown cornfod- 
 der occasionally. Have a lump of rock saltconvcni- 
 nt of accession in each field. 

Ditches and draines should now be opened and 
 cleaned out, and the stuff hauled to the compost 
 heap to mix with the weeds. 

Cradle and grass scythes should be oiled, and with 
 other harvesting tools, collected and laid away for 
 another season in a di'y place. 

Those who enjoy a tire of dry hickory wood in the 
 Winter season, should remember this is the best 
 month for cutting it. It will now season perfectly 
 and not become worm eaten. The same rule applies 
 to oak and chesnut, for fencing purposes, which have 
 been very fully proven, to last much longer. 

Vegetable Garden. — Keep the ground well stirred 
 and weeds destroyed. Peas may be sown for Fall crop. 
 Carry off pea haulim and refuse stuff to the compost 
 heap. Cut and gather such herbs as ai-e in flower, 
 and lay thom in a dry and shady place. Take up 
 onions and onion setts, and prepare ground for other 
 crops. They should be dried and hardened by ex- 
 posure to the sun, before laying away. Gather seeds 
 as they ripen. 

In latter part of month cabbage and lettuce may be 
 sown for cold frames. Also, onion seed to stand the 
 Winter. Turnips and spinach radishes may be sown 
 now. Earth up celery as its growth requires. Trans- 
 plant endive. 

Fruit Orchard. — Pears, cherries, apples, plums, 
 may be budded this month, whenever the sap flows 
 freely, and the bark will sep.ar.ate. Buds for insertion 
 should be well ripened. Strawberry beds may be 
 planted out, .advantage being taken of a damp time. 
 Finish Summer pruning of fruit trees and vines. 
 Apply wash before recommended, to trunks of trees, 
 if not previously done. Thin out fruit, where trees 
 are overloaded. Cut out all blighted limbs. 

Flower Garden. — Tie up dahlias to stakes, and 
 attend to general directions of last month.
