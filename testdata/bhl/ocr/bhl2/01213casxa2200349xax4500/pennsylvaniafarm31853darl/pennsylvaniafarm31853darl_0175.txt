Drying Vegetables for Farm Use. 

A friend says to us, that he has two or three hun- 
 dred bushels of p'3tatacs— that he has not hogs 
 enough to eat tliem, and the distance that he lives 
 from market will not allow of any profit, but a loss 
 at the present prices, should lie haul them there; and 
 he asks what he shall do with them ? Well, rather 
 than have them rot, he had better give notice that he 
 will give them away, to those who will come after 
 them. After suffering the scourge of the potato rot 
 80 many years, and living pofufolcxs-, as many have, 
 it is really refreshin;^ to hear scmebody complain, 
 that he has more potatoes than he can use. It seems 
 like old times, when, whatever mi^ht happen to oth- 
 er crops, we were sure of potatoes enough. The 
 question, however, reminded us of a plan, which 
 might be generally adopted by Airmers, for the pres- 
 ervation of potatoes, turnips' apples, and such like 
 perishable articles. 

It is drying them. By g( ing to a little expense 
 for fixtures, the labor and trouble would not be much. 

We all know that our good housewives dry apples, 
 pumpkins, huckleberries, Ac, for domestic use. Well, 
 suppose you adopt the same course for preservation of 
 potatoes, turnips, apples, &c., for farm purposes? All 
 that is absolutely necessary to do, to effect this, is to 
 make clean, slice them, and expose them to artificial 
 heat, in a kiln, or some close room, until the water 
 is ev&porated. 

For domestic uses, we pare apples previous to dry- 
 ing, but for feeding stock, nothing more need be done 
 than slicing them up. So of potatoes or turnips. 

The plan of drying potatoes, may be new to some, 
 but it is a thing that is done in some places, to a 
 considerable profit, for navy and domestic uses. Dried 
 potato is getting to be quite a valuable article. Some 
 enterprising Vermonters at Hinesburg, have started 
 a potato drying establishment, and we understand, 
 are doing a good business. 

The Buriington, {Vt.) Free Press, in an article on 
 this suliject says; 

" The application of this method to potatoes at 
 the Hinesburg factory is substantially as follows: — 
 Being thoroughly cleansed, deprived of the skins 
 and properly prepared, fresh currants of air are 
 moved in contact with the potato pulp by machine- 
 ry. The air rapidly takes up and carries off the 
 moisture. The material is made to take the shape of 
 tubes, (maccaroni fashion,) and when perfectly dry, 
 is broken in a proper mill into the form of what is 
 called "samp" or "hominy." Indeed it miglit be 
 easily mistaken for that article made from our com- 
 I raon yellow Indian corn By the same process it 
 I has lost nothing but water. But by that lo.ss it is 
 made to occupy hui rmc-sixth of its original bulk, and 
 what before weighed ftmr jionnda, now weighs but 
 out 2}""niL In that condition it can be packed in 
 tight casks or in tin canisters, and be transported 
 just as easily as so much dry rice. Years of trial 
 have proven the unchanging character of the prepa- 
 ration. 

Now then for the use. For one pound of it take 
 three pounds of boiling water, or (to speak cookery 
 book fashion) put one tea-spivinful of it into about 
 four tea-spoonfuls of boiling hot water. In ten min- 
 utes the water is entirely absorbed, and the result is 
 a ificU cfmhcd ninh of ninxJicii pntiit:i, ready to be salt- 
 ed and buttered, or dealt with as a like dish made 
 from fresh potAtoes might be. The taste differs but 
 slij^htly from that of fresh potato prepared in the same 
 manner. We speak advisedly, for we have tried. 
 Though we think any one would prefer to crush for 
 himself a fresh mealy potato, if he were in a con-
