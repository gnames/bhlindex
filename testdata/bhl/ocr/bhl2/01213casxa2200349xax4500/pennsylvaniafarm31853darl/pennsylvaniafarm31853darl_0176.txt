dition to choose, we have often, within the last five 
 years, had to be content with using potatoes tasting 
 not a'whit better than the article we are speaking of 
 —hardly as good even. 

It is difficult to comprehend at once the great im- 
 portance of such a preparation of the potato. To a 
 very large portion of the human family the potato is 
 an article of prime necessity for daily food- All 
 who have been accustomed to use it, feel the depri- 
 vation severely if placed beyond its reach for any 
 considerable time. Yet the bulkiness and perisha- 
 ble nature of the tuber in its natural condition, make 
 its transportation for great distances by either land 
 or sea an impossibility. For the want of it, the 
 health of crews on long voyages, and of soldiers or 
 other persons occupied away from where it can be 
 procured, is often greatly injured. In some districts 
 too where it is relied upon as the chief article ot 
 food great distress is caused by the failure of a crop, 
 because the want can not be supplied except at an 
 insupportable expense. Let the preparation of this 
 "imperishable potato" be made common, and all 
 these evils are substantially done away with. (jOV- 
 ernment ships, whaling vessels, merchants ships, 
 will all make it a regular part of their stores. It 
 will not occupy near the room of ship biscuit, and 
 can be kept in store with less risk of spoiling. We 
 are informed that European vessels already make it 
 reo-ularly a part of their stores, when going on voy- 
 ag'^s across the tropics, and that the discovery ships 
 under the charge of Dr. Kane are supplied with it 
 Travelle-s across the continent, and inhabitants ot 
 those parts of our own country where the vegetable 
 can not be raised successfully, find the prepared ar- 
 ticle a most convenient one for use. 

Few persons have any conception cf the amount 
 of nutritive food which can be raised in the formi ol 
 potatoes, where the soil and climate are favorable. 
 Though psund for pound, less nutritious than wheat 
 or rye, as a whole, no other crop can equal it. Care- 
 ful experiments have shown that from the same _a- 
 mount of suitable ground, where there could be rais- 
 ed on the average, 3,400 lbs. of wheat, or 5,200 lbs. 
 of peas there cSuld be raised 38,000 lbs. potatoes; 
 or reducing them all to the absolutely dry state, for 
 3 036 lbs. o1- wheat, or 2,080 lbs. of peas, there would 
 be 9 500 lbs. of potato— more than three times the 
 amount of food produced in the shape of wheat, and 
 more than four times that in the form of peas. We 
 quote this statement from Chemical Technology of 
 l)r Knapp, of Giessen— a recent work of very great 
 authority. The practical results of some expenmen- 
 talists, on the feeding of cattle with these different 
 articles, place the relative value of the potato at a 
 higher mark stiU."— [Maine Farmer.

Composting Soils.— Gardeners generally prepare 
 their soils so far as my observation has extended, in 
 a very practical way, with little or no attention to 
 the chemical principles involved in the operation. 
 They have learned, by long experience, that a par- 
 tially rotted sod makes the best general soil that can 
 be obtained. Farmers know that a clover sod plowed 
 under makes good manuring for corn; but fiirraers 
 seldom if ever, make a compost of sods for their gar- 
 dens or manure heaps. Gardeners are clearly ahead 
 of farmers in their method of cultivation and fertili- 
 zation, but they are by no means up to the standard 
 of modern science in their preparation and manage- 
 ment of soils. 

How to rot or decompose a heap of sods, has long 
 been the study of gardeners. Some let it lie in a 
 heap, with ocjasional turnings and choppings, for 
 two or three years. Others, finding that the use of 
 Ume and the access of air hastened decay, put up 
 the heap with lime, and used sticks or pieces of tim- 
 ber to separate the mass and admit the air. Others 
 tried the addition of heating dung and water. 

Now all these methods are slow and imperfect. 
 That they are slow and tedious, all who have tried 
 them well know; that they are imperfect, I will en- 
 deavor to prove. 

It is well known that plants can receive nutriment 
 only in the form of a fluid or a yas. No solid par- 
 ticles of matter, of any description, can enter the 
 circulation of plants. Hence, every thing intended 
 for their use must be capable of being dissolved in 
 water, or of being converted into a gas, when need- 
 ed. Now, if a sod, though rich in fertilizing mate- 
 rials, be not completely rotted or decomposed, or in 
 a state to become fully rotted and decomposed, it fol- 
 lows that its constituents can not possibly become 
 immediately useful. Clover contains many valua- 
 ble fertilizing ingredients; but until these ingredients 
 become changed from the form of clover into their 
 chemical elements, (lime, potash, soda, &c.,) they 
 can not be appropriated by plants. Again, even if 
 the clover be decomposed, and the chemical elements 
 remain in such relations that they are insoluble in 
 water, or not capable of readily becoming gases, they 
 can not be made available in the garden. Of course 
 it will be seen at once that under such circumstan- 
 ces a gardener may have a heap of rich material, 
 and yet, if it is not available, it is no better for pres- 
 ent use than a poor heap. 

The imperfection of the process commonly adopt- 
 ed in composting garden soils consists in several 
 points. First, where all the soil is fresh, there is no 
 well decomposed matter of a carbonaceous character 
 to act 'as an absorbent of the gasses generated by the 
 act of decomposition, and hence much valuable ma- 
 terial (ammonia) is lost. In all such compost heaps 
 a quantity of well decomposed turf or black, garden 
 soil should be mixed with the new soil, to catch the 
 ammonia produced by the decay of the new soil or 
 sod. Again, much valuable time and labor is lost 
 by the slow decay of sod where no chemical agent is 
 employed to assist the decomposition. Lime is an 
 objectionable agent, because, when freely used, it 
 locks up nearly as much fertilizing material as it lib- 
 erates. Stable manure, in a state of rapid decay, 
 or high heat, is not so objectionable as lime; but this 
 is not the best material for this purpose. Water in 
 moderate quantities is highly important; but with 
 this should be used potash— the common potash of 
 the shops— which decomposes all vegetable matter 
 rapidly and powerfully, and does not lock it up in 
 new combinations as lime does, but on the contrary 
 sets free even those combinations which lime renders 
 insoluble. 

With solutions of potash in water, any heap of 
 sod or other vegetable matter may be decomposed as 
 rapidly as the operator may desire, and all the con- 
 stituents of the heap will be placed in a state easily 
 soluble in water, or ready to become gases, on the 
 slightest action of water and vegetable life. Indeed, 
 the ingredients of plants are by potash converted m 
 great measure into gases; and if there be present veg- 
 etable charcoal, (black loam,) or animal charcoal, 
 (bone black,) or clay, these gasses will be caught up 
 and retained till taken up by other plants. No or- 
 o-anized vegetable body can resist the action of pot- 
 ash; it must decay, and resolve itself into its ongi-
