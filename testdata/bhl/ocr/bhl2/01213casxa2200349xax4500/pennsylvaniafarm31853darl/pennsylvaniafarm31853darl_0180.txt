For the Farm Journal. 
 Reply to G. Bliglit Browne, ou the Chemical aud 
 Mechauical Effects of liime. 

When I published in the May No. of the Farm 
 Journal, my observations on your "Theory of the 
 Action of Lime," I had but one object in view — to 
 draw from you a vindication of your "theory," and 
 elicit a more substantial argument in favor of it, 
 than I conceived had been presented. You had in- 
 troduced to the readers of this .Journal, an original 
 "Theory of the Action of Lime in Agriculture," 
 which, from its plausible character, was admirably 
 ealculated to mislead into what I firmly believe to be 
 error, many whose attention had not been previous- 
 ly called to the subject. 

But, without further comment, and to come to the 
 point at once, it may mt be amiss to state the points 
 on which we differ. 

The disputed question, as I understand it, is sim- 
 ply this: 

Bu what means does lime affect the mechanical at- 
 tachment of the particles of the soil f 

You contend, I believe, that lime does not mellow 
 the soil by acting on the silicious matter therein, but 
 that the disintegration of its particles, is wholly 
 effected by the pressure of the carbonic acid libera- 
 ted in a gaseous state from the lime. 

It has been my intention to support the view that 
 {as far as we have been able to learn from the reve- 
 lations that chemistry has made on this subject,) the 
 apparent mechanical change in the soil producing pul- 
 verency, &c., is effected by the re-action of the lime 
 upon the silicates of which the principal portion 
 of the soil is formed. I do not mean to be so bold 
 as to assert that this is in reality the "only way" in 
 which lime acts when rendering soil friable, but that 
 it appears (from the researches that have been made 
 upon the subject) to be the true cause of these singu- 
 lar changes. For who can say that the manifold and 
 mighty secrets of nature's great laboratory have all 
 been revealed ? No ! while we are yet compelled to 
 "see through a glass darkly," and grope with a blind 
 infatuation after the "hidden light," none but the 
 visionary speculator will presume to say that such is 
 the "only way" in which nature moves "her wonders 
 to perform." 

This view, then, that I have advanced in opposi- 
 tion to you, I beg leave to assert, is no dogma of my 
 own. I have, I hope, not vanity sufficient to permit 
 me to publish an original theory on so obscure a 
 question. I advance it only as the carefully matur- 
 ed opinion that I have drawn from the writings of 
 different authorities — men who have studied the sub- 
 ject in a scientific manner. 

In reference to the origin of the carbonic acid, you 
 distinctly assert that I have obtained a wrong impres- 
 sion from your letters. You now say that "the car- 
 ^jonic acid to which you have attributed the mellow- 

ing of the soil is not the product of the vegetable 
 matter of the soil," but that it is attributable to atmos- 
 pheric absorption. It was my impression at first 
 that you were willing to coincide with Professor 
 Johnston, in his view that the salts of lime formed 
 by the re-action of the vegetable acids of the soil on 
 the carbonate of lime were capable of spontaneous 
 decomposition — that a portion of the acid would ab- 
 sorb oxygen and pass off in another form of carbon- 
 ic acid gas and water, leaving the lime in the origi- 
 nal state of carbonate, and ready again to undergo 
 the same change. 

But this point which served to add a little plausi- 
 bility to your theory, you have now entirely discar- 
 ded. 

You have left yourself no source from which to ob- 
 tain the volumes of carbonic acid necessary to dis- 
 integrate a heavy soil, but the atmosphere, and to 
 suppose that the lime can carry enough carbonic 
 acid into the earth to support that mellowing influ- 
 ence that "lasts many years after its application," 
 seems almost incredible. 

But, before leaving this argumentof yours, I wish to 
 bring before you a point in my previous article, which 
 you have entirely omitted defending,or even alluding 
 to. I speak of the argument in which I urged that 
 the extreme solubility of carbonic acid in water at 
 the ordinary temperature, loould inevitably prevent its 
 exerting any mechanical pressure on the soil around it, 
 and therefore, the idea that this gas can rend asun- 
 der the fragments of damp earth in which it is con. 
 fined, is a physical impossibility. Here the decidedly 
 classical analogy of the "loaf of bread" seems totally 
 irrelevant, for it is the expulsion of the carbonic 
 acid from its soluliun in water, by a sudden elevation 
 of temperature, that produces the "lightness of the 
 loaf," whereas in the earth there is no such calorific 
 change, and the carbonic acid must inevitably remain 
 in a state of solution, or else be quietly carried off by 
 the spontaneous evaporation of the water from the sur- 
 face of the earth. 

In respect to the decomposition of the silicates of 
 the soil by lime, I desire to be understood as not de- 
 fending, or in any way supporting, the views of Pro. 
 fessor Mapes, although our opinions may accidental- 
 ly coincide,(and it is not unnatural that they should,) 
 yet on this point I shall venture to stand upon my 
 own footing. 

Permit me, now, to quote from your reply to me, 
 the following assertion: — "No chemist has (to my 
 knowledge) been able to demonstrate that caustic lime, 
 at the ordinary temperature, will combine with si- 
 lex." 

In answer to this I may be allowed to make the 
 following quotations. The first is from "Liebig's Let- 
 ters," one of the most popular works on Chemistry 
 that has ever been published.
