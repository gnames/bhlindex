■well understood, will enable the agrieulturist, if not 
 annihilate, at least diminish their hurtful influence. 

Dr. Liebig, whose attention was directed to this 
 fact, by esporiments made by Hales and Knight, as- 
 certained tfiat 'Vhen rain falls aftei- hot weather 
 and is folhwed by great heat without wind, so that 
 part of the plant is surrounded by an atmosphere sat- 
 urated with moisture, the cooling due to further evap- 
 oration ceases, and the plants are destroyed by ffre- 
 blasts" — {Somteiih-and.} In this sentence, it seems 
 to us, are made plain, some facts which researchers 
 ascribed to insects, want of starch, &c., &c. 

Yegetal^les constantly absorb nioisture from the 
 eurth through their roots, whicbpassesupintothestom, 
 and is then evaporated again, so that there is of ne- 
 cessity a constant, yet harmimious circulation in a 
 plant during life, and if by any external causes this 
 transpiration is checked, it will have a. highly dele- 
 terious in9aeQce ptt the plant. The potpito plant, on 
 account of its delicacy, suffers perhaps more than 
 any other from such vital disturbances. 

Now we know that there is a constant intCTchang- 
 ing in the air, that which is close to the earth's sur- 
 foce will become heated, and thus lighter, and rise to 
 make room for that below it or heavier air, on the 
 same principle as the boiling of water. Now, du- 
 ring and after the falling of ain, it may so happen 
 that the atmosphere surrounding the plant, will hold 
 large quantities of watery vapora, having very near 
 'he same specific weight, being about 1-0008, as the 
 sap itself, it will at once be apparent that exosmos- 
 is will be destroyed, and consequently produce what 
 Liebig supposed, namely, Simitenbraitd. In such an 
 instance the sap instead of passing out, by transpi- 
 ration, will accumulate in the new tuber or f)otato, 
 acting as a diverticulum, and produce what is term- 
 ed a fleshy potato, full of sap, extremely delicate, and 
 not able to withstand the decomposing influence of 
 the atmosphere. An example of the same thiag can 
 bo seen in apples growing in wet seasons. 
 In our next we will lay before your readers our yiews 
 of this treatise, as to the best preventative, and also 
 those of Klotzsoh, who will be nicely remunerated 
 by the King of Prussia, for certain experiments in 
 relation to an increase in quantity and quality.

In a country where a labor sav- 
 ing machine is calculated to benefit all classes of the 
 community, every successful attempt at substituting 
 mechanical skill for manual labor, should be regard- 
 ed as a public benefit. 

JIany farmers have felt the necessity of some in- 

vention to diminish the labors of harvest, and hap- 
 pily the time has nearly arrived when, in all proba" 
 bility, the cutting of grain and grass maybe reduced 
 to a small matter. 

I have had in operation this season, a reaper and 
 mower combined, made by Lee, Peirce & Thompson, 
 Ercildoun, Chester county. I have had cut with it 
 about twenty acres of grass, forty acres of wheat, 
 and twenty acTes of oats. Two horses will draw it 
 without difficulty. The reaper will out an average' 
 width of 5 1 feet, making two acres for every three 
 miles.' It can be set to cut high or low, to suit the- 
 condition of the grain, and a little experience will 
 enable any one to lay the sheaves so that they can be 
 bound up as, straight and snug, and with ijrreatei- ease 
 and facility, thmi after a common cradle. 

The mower vrill cut about 4| feet, or one acre for 
 every two miles that it runs. Id cutting grain or 
 grass that is very much down, it is better to cut only 
 two or three sides of the field, which will diminish 
 the amount but make better work. 

This machine took the first premium at Flower- 
 town, and I have little doubt but it will answer the 
 expectation and the demand of the farming commu- 
 nity. 

In order to prepare for its use, let every farmer 
 make his ground smooth. N. AV. 

N. B. — I send you this very brief notice of the 
 reaper, to satisfy the many enquiries that have been 
 made in regard to its operation. You are at liberty 
 to make such use of it, as your judgment may dic- 
 tate. 

Yours truly, NATHAN AV ALTON.

 Mr. Editor: — 

Dear Sir: Your intelligent cor- 
 respondent "S," on page 109 of the Farm Journal, 
 makes inquiries in relation to Shanghai, Cochin Chi- 
 na and Chittagongs, which I will endeavor to answer 
 as far as time, space, and information will permit me. 
 It is now conceded on both sides of the water, a- 
 mong "well booked up" fowl fanciers, that Cochin 
 China and Shanghai are different names for the same 
 variety or varieties. In this country, the term '"Co- 
 chin China," is pretty nearly abandoned, while in 
 England, the designation "Shanghai," has never been 
 recognised, Here we have or pretend to have. Buff, 
 Red, AVhite, Black, Grey Dominique, Spangled etc.. 
 Shanghais: — there they have Buff, Red, AVhite, and 
 Black Cochin Chinas. John Bull has not yet dis- 
 covered the Grey and Spangled sorts. 

The fowls represented some years ago, in the Poul- 
 try Books and newspapers, as Queen Victoria's Roy- 
 al Cochin China, wita smooth dark legs, long tails- 
 and no great depth of quarter, if truly represented.
