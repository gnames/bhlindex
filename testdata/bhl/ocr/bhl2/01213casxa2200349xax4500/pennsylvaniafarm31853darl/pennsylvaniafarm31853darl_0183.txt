are undoubtedly of adulterated blood. I am strong- 
 ly of the opinion, that all the pure descendants of 
 the Gallua Giganteus, (of which the Yellow Shang- 
 hai is the best type,) should be marked with very 
 short tails, yellow feathered legs, short wings, and 
 deep quarters. Any decided variation from these 
 marks would indicate more or less impurity. Where- 
 ever these are to be found, I care not what the color 
 is, uncontaminated blood may be hoped for, if not 
 relied upon. 

"While it is quite possible by careful and long con- 
 tinued effort, to attain almost any color among ani- 
 mals in a state of domestication, many if not all the 
 birds palmed off as Black, White or Speckled Shang- 
 hais are to be regarded with suspicion. This opinion 
 is founded upon a close inspection of the fowls them- 
 selves. 

Some of the finest Cocks and Hens, shown at the 
 Poultry Exhibition in Philadelphia, last November, 
 were White Shanghais. A trio, entered by Mr. Her- 
 man Osier, of Germantown, exceeded in weight, any 
 upon the ground, and in form and feather were un- 
 exceptionable, yet other fowls of the same name, and 
 we were told of the same family, exhibited all the 
 marks of worthless mongrels, — smooth slender legs, 
 long wings and tails, thin narrow bodies, and not 
 one in twenty promising to weigh five pounds at 
 maturity. These poor creatures evidently "cried 
 back" to the dung-hill side of the house, whence 
 doubtless their white color had been so speedily de- 
 rived. The name Shanghai, as applieil to them, 
 was farsioal. 

It seems to be admitted, that in the course of gen- 
 erations, this or any other color may be attained 
 without crossing. In less than three centuries, the 
 tamod descendants of the North American Wild 
 Turkey, whose uniformity is as remarkable as that 
 of speckled beans, have divided into as many com 
 plexions as can be found in any old granny's crop o,. 
 pure Dunghills. Why may it not be so with the lin. 
 eal heirs of His East Indian Majesty — Gallus Gigan- 
 teus ? Form is a much stronger indication of puri- 
 ty than color. 

In the best families of Buffs or Yellow Shanghais, 
 an occasional white or black feather may be seen, — 
 and it is likely that these markings patiently fol- 
 lowed up, for a numb°r of years, would lead to many 
 white or many black feathers, and eventually to all 
 over white or black. The writer ouce bred a flock ot 
 white puddle ducks in a few years, from throe gray 
 ones. 

In regard to Chittagongs, my first knowledge of 
 them was obtained from Dr. Bennett's Poultry 
 Book, in which the author, and- his abl6 correspon- 
 dent, Dr. Kerr, (Asa Rugg,) exalts them above all 
 other fowls for stature and personal appearance. I 
 purchased a stag anl two pullets from the latter gen- 
 tleman. They were by no means remarkable for 

uniformity of plumage, but came up to the highest 
 figure for size, fertility and hardiness. Equal to tho 
 strong Indian, they have constitutions "like the Uni- 
 ted States." They are less inclined to sit than the 
 Shanghais, and owing to their longer bodies, exceed 
 them on an average for weight. I have two hens of 
 this variety now, whose joint weight, in March last, 
 was 20 lbs. 3 oz. Several pullets, of the same sort, 
 from seven to nine mouths old, weighing over 8 lbs. 
 Few Shanghais will come up to these figures. Of 
 their remote ancestors, I am not prepared to speak. 
 They are, no doubt, closely related to the other very 
 large bree ls,but whence their variation, I have never 
 been able to learn. They are larger, hardier, and 
 much more prolific than the Boobies. They do not 
 feather so rapidly as these, but are not so long in at. 
 taining a covering as the Shanghais. 

If the Poultry Fancier wants great weight, and 
 is willing to run the risk of a parti colored flock, ho 
 cannot do better than rear the Chittagongs. Nay, if 
 ho be careful and judicious, he may breed them of a 
 tolerable sameness —almost any color that pleases 
 him. For my own part, I would be very sorry to 
 give them up. 

The Boobies (or Bucks county Fowls) are never 
 Red, or Yellow. They run from Black to Grey, — the 
 most of them dotted with white on a black ground. 
 They are probably related to the Jersey Blues and 
 Black Javas. In most cases they feather as rapidly 
 as the smaller breeds. They are gouty and of late 
 maturity. You may breed them a long time and get 
 nothing from them that resembles a Shanghai, in 
 quality, shape or color. 

Lately another variety of Shanghais has started 
 up, under the euphonious title of "Brahma Pootra," 
 and judging from a pair of young ones, which the 
 writer received a few days since, from his friend Dr. 
 McClintock, of Philadelphia, equal to any thing that 
 have yet made their appearance, of a beautiful light 
 cobr and the most perfect hig breed shape, they 
 will no doubt have a great run among the fancy. At 
 present, a ferocious war (of words) is raging in re- 
 lation to them, between two of our most talented and 
 distinguished hen-grannies. Dr. Bennet and Mr. 
 Burnham.

Perhaps some of our Southern friends, or Lord 
 Northby, will see the aptness of the quotation. 

As the science of Henology progresses, Brahma 
 Pootras, Iloang IIos, Hong Kongs, Cochin China, 
 Imperial Chinese, etc., will resolve themselves under 
 the comprehensive family name of Shanghai, and if 
 further distinctions be necessary, the surnames Black> 
 Buff, White, Spotted, Ringed, Speckled and Streak- 
 ed, may be added.
