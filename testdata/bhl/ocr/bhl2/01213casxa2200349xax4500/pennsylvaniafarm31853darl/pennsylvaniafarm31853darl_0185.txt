 The Fruits of Juue— Cherries and Cherry Trees. 

Mr. Editor: — 

The warm days of Spring, and the 
 quickly following first hot days of Summer— the time 
 of Spring fever, and panting langor— have now pass- 
 ed into the established heats of Summer, more endu- 
 rable, because the season brings with it its mltlg.a- 
 tions. But these first sudden and sweltering heats, 
 meet us all unprepared. We cannot all at once for- 
 get the cold that we felt but yesterday, and we hesi- 
 tate to let the air have full play upon our ribs, and 
 even then it does not readily give tone to the throb- 
 bing system. In the way of food, the provisions 
 stored up through winter are stale, or dry, and heat- 
 ing. Something.a little acid and very juciy, is what 
 we crave. We drink acidulated water with delight; 
 salads are refreshing; good, large ripe cherries, fresh 
 from the tree, reconcile us, and start expressions of 
 delight; and the grand luxury and boast of the sea- 
 son, 'a dish of ripe strawberries smothered in cream,' 
 gratifies every sense, and leaves nothing to be desir- 
 ed, only that it might be 'always June.' 

Comparatively but few accept for themselves these 
 enjoyments from the offering hand of Nature. True, 
 many have cherry trees,but either they are so few, or 
 so late, or so indifferent in sorts, that they minister 
 but little pleasure. And fruit may be purchased in 
 the market, but this necessity of paying, and round- 
 ly too, and getting in return but stale, bruised or 
 sweated fruit, or what is yet sour, unripe, and un- 
 wholesome as well as unpalatable, is a different thing 
 from the enjoyment of picking one's own perfectly 
 ripe fresh fruit, from oue'si own generous trees, 
 whence the finest of sorts are glittering successively 
 into the lustre of maturity, and offering their re- 
 freshing juice at 'morn and noon, and dewy eve.' 

An intermmediate enjoyment is that of going, when 
 the appetite becomes imperative, a mile or two through 
 sunshine and dust, to a place where cherries grow, 
 begging or buying leave to eat— taking a glut that it 
 5s hoped may do for a week, and then going home to 
 think it had been as well on the whole, to have staid 
 there, and that the cherries eaten from the tree are 
 not much more wholesome than the market ones. 

But cherries, quite ripe and fresh, are most entire- 
 ly wholesome, and even sanitary, and are eaten by 
 children who have constant access to them, and who 
 enjoy them so greatly, without the fear of ill eff?cts. 
 They are Nature's own provision for the season in 
 which they appear, and instead of inducing the dis- 
 eases of Summer, they prevent and cure them. 

Cherry trees, especially of the sweet kinds, are the 
 handsomest of fruit trees, and a well planted ave- 
 nue or grove of them adds greatly to the beauty of a 
 country home. They are less liable to disease or in- 
 jury by insects — the productive sorts are more uni- 
 formly, and constantly fruitful than most othe 

fruits, only equalled in this respect by grapes, (the 
 cherries of Autumn,) currants and some other ber- 
 ries. 

Cherries of many kinds attain a circumference of 
 over three inches; of such it is no mincing to "make 
 two bltos at a cherry." By the rule of compensa- 
 tion which prevails through Nature's works, fruits 
 with so much rich flesh are seldom found to contain 
 a perfect seed. 

Besides the enjoyment furnished by the beauty of 
 the trees, and the excellence of the fruit, there is a 
 great fund of pleasure in the diversity of colors, sea- 
 son, form and flavor. A dish of the earliest, com- 
 posed of Early Purple, Early White Heart, Knight's 
 Early Black, and Cob's Transparent, mingled with 
 a few of the bright green leaves, as a foil to their 
 brilliant lustre, is 'beautiful exceedingly.' Before 
 these kinds are past, the magnificent Black Tarta- 
 rian, the sprightly, tender Elton,the delicate Belle of 
 Choisy, and the yet acid Mayduke, come forward 
 with their claims for admiration. Later yet, the rich 
 Black Eagle, the beautifully marked Burr's Seed- 
 ling, and the grand Napoleon, and with them the ex- 
 cellent fruit of the large Weeping Cherry tree, and 
 the Reine Hortense. 

Still the eye is not tired of seeing new colors and 
 forms, nor the palate of tasting fresh flavors; and 
 while the fruits of June are yet in perfection, July 
 advances with new liveries and new cliiras. The 
 great Bigarreau, the very distinct and valuable Butt- 
 ner's Yellow, the solid and pungent Gridly, the acid 
 Belle Magnifique, the vinous Downer, and others 
 keep up a supply till August, and even later if it 
 could be desired, among the host of other fruits that 
 then begin to call for notice. 

The culture of the trees shall be the subject of 
 another paper.

To THE Editors oe the Farm Journal: — 

Nature, 
 in the operation of her Laws, is often sugestive and 
 highly instructing to an observing mind. Her oper- 
 ations on the surface of the earth, ii the atmosphere, 
 and in the vapours that rise above use, are well wor- 
 thy our notice. And perhaps no class of men have 
 more to do, directly or indirectly, and feel more in- 
 terested and profited by the operations of the laws 
 that attend these elements, than the farmer. That 
 the soil be fertile, the air healthful, and that the 
 clouds descend in fruitful showers, is his first inter- 
 est as regards his occupation. The farmer, from 
 what he sees passing around him, may not only de, 
 rive lessons of science relating to agriculture, but 
 lessons also of moral truth ; as when Providence
