sees fit to withhold the showers of rain, and leave 
 our seed fields to a scorching sun and drying; winds. 
 This has been the case to an extent not known for 
 years in our county, (Mifflin,) but little rain having 
 fallen for about two months. The oats and potato 
 crops in many instances, are entire failures, and the 
 prospects of the corn crop very unpromising. 

This season, in this section of the State, has been 
 •well suited to show the effect of plaster on Indian 
 corn, and to give some idea of the amount of mois- 
 ture required to bring its nutritive qualities into ac- 
 tion on the plant. Its effect or non-effect, according 
 to the time of application, has been very marked on 
 several fields and parts of fields, that have come un- 
 der notice, one of which is our own. 

About one acre of this field of corn was nlastered, 
 while the ground was still quite moist, and but a few 
 hours before a fall of rain. The remainder of the 
 field was plastered within two or three days after ihe 
 first application, and while the ground was in grow- 
 ing condition. A shower of rain fell shortly after, 
 sufficient to cause the plaster to disappear on the 
 whole field, and then little or no rain fell for about 
 six weeks. 

In about three weeks after plastering, I observed a 
 difference in size and colour of the corn in that corn- 
 er of the field where we first plastered, and the oth- 
 er part, (the drills run angling across;) the first plas. 
 tered, was a deep green, the other yellow, and much 
 less in size. This difference became more and more 
 marked from week to week, until our neighbors be- 
 gan to wonder why there was so much difference in 
 our corn. For some weeks pait the plaster last ap- 
 plied.has been taking effeot,and the corn has changed 
 to a healthy green color, but it is still not less than 
 ten days behind the first plastered, in growth. 

It appears evident from this, that it requires a very 
 considerable amount of rain to bring fully into effect 
 the fertilising agency of plaster. And it is a mat 
 ter of some importance to the fiirmer, to have it ap- 
 plied to his corn crop as early as possible, that it may 
 have the advantage of the showers that may fall. 
 We think- it is sometimes delayed to disadvantage, in 
 waiting until the plants are all up, that the plaster 
 may be thrown on or around the roots of each stalk. 
 Experience teaches that this is not necessary. We 
 have applied it on our corn broadcast, with as much 
 success as when we dropped it on each hill, and we 
 believe it is not possible to draw any difference (oth- 
 er things being equal) in a field of corn, between the 
 part having the plaster applied to each hill, and 
 another part of this same having it applied broad- 
 cast. Our method, however, is to scatter it along in 
 the row or drill, making it appear white. This can 
 be done before any of the corn is above the ground, 
 and so may be prepared to benefit the plant as soon 
 as up.

Black Knots on Plum Trees. 

Mr. Editor: — 

Having seen and lead many com- 
 munications on this subject, in different agricultural | 
 papers, and having myself had considerable of the 1 
 disease on my plum and cherry trees, I long since i 
 endeavored to discover the cause, but so far without i 
 any satisfactory result. , ' , 

Many writers contend, and even give a description' j 
 of an insect, which they say causes the mischief. { 

I have time and again examined these tumors, in I 
 all stages of their growth. I have found the larva | 
 of insects after the tumors became of some size, 'tis J 
 true, but in their incipient stage, could never, evenf' 
 with the aid of a microscope detect the least vestige ' | 
 of in-iect life. A friend in Columbia, once under- I 
 took to convince me of the truth of the insect theory , 
 by occular proof. He had a number of plum trees I 
 in his yard, and many of them bearing an extra IfJ 
 large crop of— knots. We at once cut down some ' ( 
 branches and began the work of dissecting the knots i 
 in real scientific style — that is by a clean incision i 
 from one extremity to the other, and what did we find? \ 
 why an abundance of worms to be sure; here was a f 
 confirmation; as my friend said, 'seeing is believing' l 
 — here is the proof. However as these larvae were p 
 old acquaintances of mine, I at once knew them to f i 
 be the progeny of the curculio, having frequently I i 
 seen them in similar situations on . my own trees, i 
 Such an exhibition of worms, living and preying 
 on these knots, would no doubt have convinced most 
 people, that they were the cause of the disease. Aa 
 for myself, I am fully satisfied they had no more to 
 do with the cause than the "man in the moon," per- 
 haps less, but were merely an effect of some other 
 and prior, but to me unknown cause — the curculios 
 using these tumors after they become of some size, 
 in the same manner, and' for the same purpose as the 
 fruit, — "to increase and multiply." In fact the 
 larviB appear to be quite as much at home in these 
 tumors as they are in the fruit itself. When the 
 knots become enlarged, the branch on which they 
 grow, becomes diseased for some inches in the heart 
 of the twig, and unless the branch is cut off, will re. 
 appear, and increase in numbers until the tree is de- 
 stroyed. 

From the effects of this disease, the common 
 Morello cherry has been nearly swept from the coun- 
 try; while the English and plum stone Morello, are, 
 so far as my observations extend, entirely exempt 
 though growing in close proximity to affected trees. 
 Were these knots caused by insects, it would be pass- 
 ing strange that two kinds of Morello cherries should 
 bo entirely exempt from their depredations, and the 
 common Morello, the Bleeding Heart cherry, and 
 many kinds of plum trees, so congenial to their tastes. 
 I have often found them on the stems of young plum
