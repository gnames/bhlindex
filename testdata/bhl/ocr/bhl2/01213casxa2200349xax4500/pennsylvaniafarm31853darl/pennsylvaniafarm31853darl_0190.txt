THE PALMER WORM. 

[September 

The Palmer Worm. 

An insect, formerly known by this name, lias ap- 
 peared in great numbers upon fruit and forrest trees, 
 during tli^ past month. Apple, cherry, and plum 
 trees, and, among forest trees, the white oak have 
 Buffored more or less from its depredations in all parts 
 of New England, and in the State of New York. 
 Communications concerning it,aoccimpanied by speci- 
 mens, have been sent to me from Bradford, Andover, 
 and Westboro", Massachusetts; from New Haven and 
 Salisbury, Connecticut; and from Keene and New 
 Boston, New Hampshire. About the 10th of June, 
 the same insects were first observed on fruit trees in 
 my own garden, where, however, they have not been 
 numerous, and have not done much injury. In oth- 
 er places, their ravages have been deplorable, and 
 have been compared to these of canker worms; the 
 leaves of trees attacked by them looking as though 
 they had been scorched by fire. In some of the or- 
 chards, they have not spared even the fruit. Which 
 has been attacked and mostly destroyed by them. 
 They have now come to their growth, and have fin- 
 ished the course, in their present form for this sea- 
 BOn. 

These insects agree, in all respects, with the ac- 
 counts given of the palmer worms that prevailed in 
 many parts of New England, in June, 1791. It was 
 remarked, after this great visitation, that they did 
 not return the next year in the same places. Wheth- 
 er, until the present season, they have ever again been 
 observed, in the like profusion, is unknown to me. 
 Probably some of these insects might have been 
 found almost ever year by diUigent search. Perhaps 
 they are the same as those heretofore called fire 
 worms, of whose history I cannot find any thing in 
 print. 

A particular description of the palmer worm may 
 be thought unnecessary and supetiuous, since the in- 
 sect has been so recently and so widely observed, and 
 has been pretty well described in the newspapers. 
 But as I have little more' to add concerning it, and 
 have been applied to publicly and privately, for 
 intijrmation on the subject, it may be proper to put 
 on record an account of it as it passed under my own 
 observation. 

In its early stages, this worm, or caterpiller, though 
 Var3'ing somewhat in color, is mostly pale green, with 
 two slender brown lines along the top ol the back, 
 and a pale brown head. It has sixteen feet, six of 
 which, near the head, are jointed, and end with a 
 single claw; the others are merely fleshy protuberan- 
 ces without joints, the terminal pair being the long- 
 est. When fully grown, the insect measures half an 
 inch, or rather more, in length, and then bears a 
 striking resemblance to the common bud-worm of the 
 apple tree; the back assuming, generally, a darker 
 color, and the sides of the body. being marked with 
 black points, arranged three together on each side of 
 every ring. Two blackish semi-circular spots or 
 marks, may .also generally be observed, at this peri- 
 od, on the top of the first ring. A few short hairs 
 may be seen on the body by means of a magnifying 
 glass. On my own trees, these insects have confin- 
 ed themselves mostly to the terminal leaves and buds; 
 on others, in places where t.hey have been numerous, 
 they have spread all over the leaves, and have de- 
 voured the whole green substance, leaving only the 
 net-work of veins untouched. They are exceedingly 
 active in their motions, moving either forwards or 
 backwards at pleasure, with a kind o*' impatient jer- 
 king motion, which renders it dittioult to hold them. 
 When the trees are shaken, these worms drop, and 

hangsuspended by threads,like canker worms. Wheth' 
 er they leave the trees in the same way, when they 
 undergo their course, — if indeed they do leave them 
 at this time.and where they underg.i their final trans- 
 formations, I have not ascertained, being prevented 
 by other engagements from watching tbeir further 
 progress. 

One of my correspondents has informed me that 
 these Worms mostly disappeared after a late hail 
 storm; and another one states that they all took le.ave 
 during a heavy shower on Monday last. A few, that 
 ■were kept for observation in a glass jar, have cover- 
 ed themselves with a thin web of silk, and some of 
 these have already taken the chrysalis from within 
 their webs. More than half of my specimens have 
 been stung by ichneumon flies, which have deposit- 
 ed a single egg in each one of their victims. The 
 m.aggots bred from these eggs, are now leaving the 
 lifeless worms, and are spinning themselves up in 
 white, oblong oval, silken pods or cocoons. 

If the palmer worms elsewhere have suffered the 
 same fate in the like proportion, we have little cause 
 to fear their ravages next year. The chrysalis is 
 about one quarter of an inch long, of a pale yellow- 
 ish brown color, and diflTora from that of the bud- 
 worm in noi having transverse rows of teeth, or little 
 notches, around its body. The final translormation 
 remains to be observed; and, until the insect is ob- 
 tained in the winged or moth state, its sjientific name 
 cannot be determined. 

On the morning of the 28th May, I saw, in the 
 cemetery at Worcester, immense numbers of gray or 
 whitish moths, about twice the size of the common 
 clothes' moth, flying about almost in swarms, being 
 disturbed from the grass and trees by my p.assing. 
 Two days afterwards, a few of the same little moths 
 were seen in my garden; and Dr. Sanborn informed 
 me that his garden was alive with them on the 23d 
 of May, They were also very numerous, about the 
 same time, at New Haven, and in other places since 
 visited by the palmer worms. But whether the lat- 
 ter were, or were not, the descendants of these little 
 moths, it would not be safe now to say. The moths, 
 though not wholly unknown to me by sight, before 
 this Spring, have heretofore been so rare that my 
 collection contained only a single specimen, and that 
 in too poor a condition to enable satisfactorily to in- 
 vestigate its scientific character and ascertain to what 
 modern genus it belonged. 

As attention has been generally directed to the 
 habits of the palmer worm|during the present season, 
 other persons, more favorably situated than I am, 
 may be expected to pursue and make known the fur- 
 ther history and transformations of this destructive 
 insect. 

I regret not being able to give a better account of 
 it at this time, and still more that the pressure of my 
 oiBcial duties necessairly interferes with the contin- 
 ued and further investigation it would otherwise 
 please me to make upon it. — [New England Farmer.

Farm Experience. — Twenty years experience up- 
 on a farm has taught me that one acre of laud, well- 
 manured and tiUed.will produce more than two acres 
 which received the same .amount of labor and ma- 
 nure. That one cow, well fed, will be of more pro- 
 fit than two fed upon the same amount of fodder; 
 this will apply to all other stock, — that one ton of 
 of hay cut when the grass begins to blossom, will 
 produce as much milk as two tons, cut when the 
 seed is ripe. — Anon.
