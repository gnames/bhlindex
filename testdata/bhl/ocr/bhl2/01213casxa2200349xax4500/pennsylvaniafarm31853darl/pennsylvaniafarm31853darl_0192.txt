ALDERNEY BULL. 

[SeptemdeR 

Ture Alderuey or Jersey Bull 

Owned bij Maisliall and Francis Strode, near West. 
 Chester, Chester County, Penna. 
 On opposite page we give a portrait of a superior 
 Bull of this breed, being the same animal to which 
 we advertedin a former number,thcn owned by John 
 Worth, of E. Bradford, butsince purchased by his pre- 
 sent owners. We consider it a fortunate circumstance 
 for the dairym'en ot this section of country, that 
 they have now an opportunity of obtaining a cross, 
 by this bull, with their best milking cows. He pos- 
 sesses in a remarkable degree the property of good 
 handlinrj, a point too much overlooked in judging of 
 stock, and which we consider of great importance. 
 Guenon's marks of milking qualities are also strong- 
 ly developed. In a m'ilk or butter dairy, size no less 
 tlian many other desirable points of other brecds.the 
 farmer can well afford to sacrifice, provided he se- 
 cures these primary objects combined, with efli'y/eftZ- 
 ing, kindly disposition, and habit of milking close up 
 to time of calving. For these objects the Jersey cow 
 can be recommended with great confidence, inas- 
 much as they have been bred with this view, exclu- 
 sively for a very long period, and as a matter of ne- 
 cessity in so circumscribed a spot as the isle of Jer- 
 sey, other considerations were altogether lost sight 
 of. They may be said to have a hereditary superior, 
 ity for rich milk and butter. The old unimproved 
 Jersey cows from 180O to 1S30, though far inferior 
 in feeding qualities ..arid' neatness of form, to the 
 present.was even then counted superior to every oth- 
 er breed for the uniform richness of their milk, which 
 from fresh pasture in spring was said to appear like 
 clouted cream. "She had always possessed the head 
 of a fawn, a soft eye, elegant crumpled horns, small 
 ears, yellow within, a clean neck and throat, fine 
 bones, a fine tail, above all a well formed capacious 
 udder with large swelling milk veins." She had 
 however no tendency to fatten, all fattening property 
 being absorbed by the great quantities of milk and 
 cream she produced. About twelve years ago, at- 
 tempts were made by the Jersey Agricultural Socie- 
 ty to remedy these defects.by selecting the best mod- 
 els and crossing them with a fleshy well conditioned 
 bull, of a race that was also known to produce qual 
 ity and quantity of butter, and the result has been a 
 "breed with a rounded form with a tendency to make 
 fat, without having lost the butyraceous nature. An 
 analysis of the milk of the' Jersey cow, has been 
 made by Professor E. Emmons, of Albany, which on 
 comparing, with an analysis of the milk of the Ayr- 
 shires made under the direction of the British Gov- 
 ernment, by Professor Thompson, for the purpose of 
 determining the relative value of food in the produc- 
 tion of butter, resulted as follows: It will be well to 
 recollect, that the Ayrshire cow, whose milk is supe- 
 rior to the (jeneralily of other cows, was in this case 
 fed on grass, while that from tAo Jersey cow, whose 

milk was examined; was from an imported animal by 

John A. Taintor, Esq., selected by himself in Jersey, 

but she was in low condition, not having recovered 

from the effect of a voyage. Her milk was taken in 

winter, after recent calving, but she had been fed 

only on hay, with an allowance of four quarts of bran 

as her daily allowance, but notwithstanding yielded 

eleven to twelve quarts of milk in 24 hours.

Professor Emmons says, " .according to the forego- 
 ing result.the milk furnished by the Jersey cow,own- 
 ed by Mr. T.aintor, will amount to 154 lbs, per week 
 and should yield 12.32 lbs. of butter. In Professor 
 Thop'pson's esperiicents, the yield of milk for six- 
 teen days was 309 lbs. 14 oz. G drs. which gave 11 
 lbs. 14 oz. 11 drs, of butter. During an equal period 
 Mr. Taintor's cow will give 352 lbs. of milk, which 
 willyield28 16-100 lbs. butter,giving a balance in her 
 favor of about 18. lbs.. An Ayrshire cow, owned by 
 another gentleman, yielded 51G grs. of butter per 16 
 ozs. of milk. Milk taken from the cans of a milk- 
 man, which was regarded as good milk,gave 375 grs. 
 of butter per 16 ozs. An analysis of the milk of a 
 common cow, which is interesting by comparison 
 with that of the Alderney or Ayrshire, resulted as

The above experiments are conclusive as to the su- 
 periority of these two excellent breeds of cows, Ayr- 
 shire -and Jersey/for dairy purposes. We gave in 
 former numljers of the Farm Journal, portraits of 
 both bull and cow of the Ayrshire breed owned by 
 E. P. Prentice, near Albany. 

Col. Le Couteur, of the isle of Jersey, from whose 
 valuable essay, published in the transactions of the 
 New York Agricultural Society, much of the above 
 matter is condensed, further says: 

"The Jersey farmer treats his cow with gentleness 
 and care; it might be more correct to say his wife 
 does so. On good farms she is usually housed at 
 night after the end of October to the end of Februaiy, 
 if heavy raiU; hail, or snow prevail. It is deemed to 
 be healthful to give a cow a short run daily through 
 tlie winter, excepting in stormy weather. At this 
 season, which is usually several degrees warmer than
