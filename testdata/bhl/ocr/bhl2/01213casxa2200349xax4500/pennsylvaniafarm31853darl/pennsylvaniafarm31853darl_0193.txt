ALDERNEY BULL.

in the mildest part of Devonshire, she is fed with a 
 certaiti portion of straw, from 10 lbs. to 20 lbs. of 
 hay, with about 10 lbs. to 20 lbs. of parsnips, white 
 carrots, turnips, or mangold-wurtzel. 

The small portion of grass whioh she may pick. up 
 in the winter, with the above quantity of food.enable 
 her to produce a rkhand well-colored sample of but- 
 ter-till within six weeks of parturition.' 

At this period, which is usually regulated to take 
 place about the mouth of IMaroh or April, just when 
 the cow, being in full milk, may soon be placed on' 
 the fresh spring pasture in April or May, she is an 
 object of extreme care. On calving she is' given a 
 warm potation of cider, with a little powdered gin- 
 ger, Quayle hints that pet cows are, further indulged 
 with a toast in their caudle. 

The calf is taken from the cow at once, and fed by 
 hand. It may be well to advise that on the first oc- 
 casion of calving, the calf should bo allowed to, draw 
 the cow fully, for no milking by haud will so com- 
 pletely empty the udder, nor cause the milk-veins 
 to swell to their fall developement,as will the suction 
 of the calf. 

Some of the early, meadows produce rich grass in 
 March; but the general flush of grass, which comes 
 on generally late in April, is the period when the 
 Jersey firmer looks forward with anxiety. The cow 
 is then tethered to the ground by means of a halter 
 five or six feet long; this is appended by a ring and 
 swivel to a chain which encircles her horns, closed 
 by a ring and bar; the other end of the halter is fas- 
 tened to a chain six or eight feet long, which is con- 
 nected by a swivel and ring to a stout iron 'stake a 
 foot long; this is driven into the ground by means of 
 a wooden mallet. The cow having this circular 
 range is compelled to eat it clean. She is usually 
 moved thrice a day, and milked moriiing and even- 
 ing, on many farms at midday also. Under this 
 system, the writer has owned four cows that produc- 
 ed eight-and-forty pounds Jersey, or above fifty-one 
 pounds imperial, weight of rich yellow butter per 
 week in the month of May and part, of .Juno. 

In very hot weather, in July or August, it is ad- 
 visable to shelter the cow from the heat and flies; 
 otherwise these tease cows to such a degree, hy forc- 
 ing them to run about incessantly, that they have no 
 time for repose and chewing the cud; they, in conse- 
 quence, afford much less milk or cream. 

It was anciently thought that cream from the Jer- 
 sey cow was too rich for making cheese. Mr. Le 
 Feuvre, of La Houge, who has a fine breed of cows 
 tried the experiment two years since, and suoceederd 
 to admiration. It was made from the pure' milk, 
 cream and all, as it comes from the cow. It was 
 found that the quantity of milk that would have pro- 
 duced a pound of butter afforded one pound and a 
 half of cheese. 

From the quantity of milk which produced a 
 cheese of twenty pounds weight, the dnuiiini/a i)( the 
 curds and whey, on being churned, yielded four, 
 pounds of butter. This butter was of an inferior 
 quality when eaten with bread, but was superior to 
 any other for the making of pastry: it was peculiar- 
 ly hard, and of excellent texture for such use in hot 
 weather. The writer has tasted cheese from Mr. Le 
 Feuvre's farm quite equal in quality to -the richest 
 double Glo'ster. 

On one or two farms besides General Fouzel's,but- 
 ter is made from clouted cream in the Devonshire 
 mode; but as this is not peculiar to Jersey, it is not 
 noticed further than that ten pounds of butter are u- 
 suiiUy made in five minutes by this process. The u- 
 sual way of procuring the cream is by placing the 

milk in pans about six inches deep, the glazed, shallow 
 earthenware haviiig taken the place of the unglazed, 
 deep vessels. ' , ' 

It is admitted that the richest milk and cream are 
 produced by cows whose ears have a yellow or orange 
 color within. Some of the best cows give twenty- 
 six quarts of milk in twenty-four hours, and four- 
 teen pounds of butter from such milk in one week. 
 Such are rare. Good cows afford twenty ((uarts of 
 milk daily, and ten pounds of Ijutter weekly, in the 
 spring and summer moiiths. Butter is made every 
 second or third day. 

Lactometers indicate the .degrees of richness, or 
 cream, which the milk of any cow affords, with great 
 nicety. This varies with different food. The mode 
 is to fill the lactometer, up to zero with the first milk 
 that is drawn from the cow in the morning; then, 
 when the udder is nearly emptied, to fill a second 
 lactometer with the residue of the milk, throwing a 
 little out of the lactometer, lo refill it to zero with 
 the very last drops which can be drawn from the 
 cow: these will be nearly all cream. The lactome- 
 ter filled with the fijst milking only indicate fourde- 
 gree.s- of cream, while that filled with the last milk- 
 ing forty degrees of cream. Then ■ by dividing the 
 sum total, fortj'-four'by two, we have twenty-two de- 
 grees of cream, which a very good cow will produce: 
 others so little as ten or fifteen. 

Jersey butter, made when the cows are partially 
 fed on p.arsnips, or white carrots and grass, in Sep- 
 tember and October, when salted and potted will keep 
 till Spring, preserving as well as Irish butter, with 
 a much less rank flavor. 

(Col. Le. Conteur informs us under date of June 
 15, 1850, that yearling bulls of the pure breed would 
 be delivered at Southampton, England, from £10 to 
 £12, and a yearling prize heifer at from £10 to £15 
 —from §48 to .§70 each.) 

We- can only ?ay from our own observation, that 
 at the great Southampton cattle show in England in 
 1844,and which from its convenience of access, to the 
 isle of Jersey, had a good representation of their 
 cows, that they attracted our attention more than any 
 other stock on the ground. We have never seen, and 
 cannot imagine any thing more perfectly neat ^ni 
 beautiful than the specimens we there saw. Not 
 looking to weigh more than 400 to 500 lbs. when fat, 
 with necks and head as graceful as a fawn, small, 
 delicate tapering limbs, small thin ears, full and li- 
 vely eyes,, smooth crumpled horns; they looked as if 
 they would not consume more food than a good sized 
 sheep, and might be herded together in the same 
 way. Youatt says "in England they ace found only 
 in gentlemen's parks and pleasure grounds, where 
 they maintain their occupancy, partly on account o,f 
 tlie richness of their milk, and the great Quantity of 
 butter, which it yields, but more from the diminutives 
 size of the animals. It is thought fashionable that 
 the view from the breakfast table or drawing room 
 of the house, should represent an Aldernoy cow, or 
 two, gracing at a little distance. 

Fashion in this case seems to have taken a useful 
 direction, and it is highly probable will be imitalted 
 to considerable extent in the United States, though 
 for a different reason. The Alderneys will be duly 
 attended to before breakfast, and the breakfast tabU
