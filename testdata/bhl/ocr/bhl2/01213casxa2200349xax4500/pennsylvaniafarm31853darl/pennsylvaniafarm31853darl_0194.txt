at breakfast time, which will suit better the busi- 
 ness habits of Young America. 

Ah instance is on record of a Jersey cow having 
 produced 19 lbs. of butter per week, for three siic- 
 cessive wdeks. Many have produced 14 lbs. per week, 
 but 10 lbs. per week during the Spring and Summer 
 months appears to be most common in their native 

island.

Importation of English Gattle. 

We have lately mentioned the purchase of several 
 head of cattle and sheep in England by American 
 breeders. In addition to these, we observe that the 
 Mark Lane Express states that" fifty head of the 
 "choicest specimens of short-horned cattle" were 
 shipped by the Crown last month fur Philadelphia. 
 It is said that twenty-four head of tliese cattle and a 
 quantity of sheep, were the property of Mr. R. A. 
 Alexander, of Airdrie House, Scotland, and were des- 
 tined for his estate in Wojdford county, Kentucky. 
 For two of these animals, a two-yeaT old heifer, and 
 a yearling bull, he gave £325 — or S2,G25. 

Another vessel, we are informed, brings out the 
 far-famed bull "Balco," bred by the late Mr. Bates, of 
 Kirkleavington, and purchased at his sale in 1850, 
 when one year old, by the Earl of Burlington, for. 
 155 guineas. He has been used the last two seasons 
 by Mr. Tanquery, at Hendon, of whom he has been 
 recently purchased by Col. L. G. Morris, the Presi- 
 dent of the New York State Agrcultural Society, on 
 behalf of himself and Mr. Becar, of New York. — 
 These gentleman have also purchased some highly 
 v.aluable cows and heifers from Mr. Tanquerary, as 
 well as the Hon. N. N. Hill and Mr. Harvey Combe; 
 they ha-ve further selected some splendid South Down 
 sheep from Mr. Jonas Webb, with a quantity of Berk- 
 shire, Suffolk, and Yorkshire pigs. 

In connection with the above, are several choice 
 Devon cattle, bred by the Earl of Leicester, destin- 
 ed for George Vail, Esq., of Troy, New York. — [Cul-

lutroduction of French Merino into Western Penn 
 sylvauia. 

We observe by one of our Western Exchanges 
 that Dr. G. S. Hayes, of ^Allegheny, has imported 
 during the present year, in connection with Solomon 
 W. Jevvett, of Middlebury, Vermont, 112 French Me- 
 rino owes and fovir buoks^ — of which flock Dr. Hayes 
 received for his share twenty-eight ewes and two bucks 
 costing him heresomethingover three thousand dollars. 
 They cost per head some twenty-five dollars passage 
 from France to New York, and eight dollars a head 
 from New York to Pittsburg. 

These sheep are something finer than, any before 
 imported to this counti-y — having been selected more 
 with a view to the fineness ,6f the staple than the 
 largeness or weight of the fleece. The. ewes aver- 
 aged about 120 pounds weight, and the bucks 200 
 pounds. The Dr. sold this year's French Merino 
 clip of wool, unwashed, at 50 cents per pound — be- 
 ing about equal to 70 cents washed. He sold a buck 
 five months old this Spring, of his own raising, for 
 $250, and an interest of one-half in another,for li;210, 
 after having had the use of him for two previous 
 years. 

These prices are high up in the figures, but are 

nothing remarkable for this breed of sheep. lie 

i^eeps these sheep principally on his farm in Butler 

ounty. We trust he may have specimens of these 

heep at the great fair at Pittsburg. — [Ilarrisb'g Un. 

Cows Holdiu°^ up tUeir Milli. 

. It is well known that many cows when they first 
 come in, when their calves are taken from them, will 
 hold up their milk, sometimes to such a degree as al- 
 niost dry themselves before they will give it down. 

"A few years ago," writes a correspondent of an 
 English newspaper, "I bought a young cow, which 
 proved to be very wild and when I took her first calf 
 she would not give down her milk. I had heard it 
 remarked that putting a weight on the cow's back 
 would make her give her milk down. I according- 
 ly drove her into a stable, got a bushel of grain and 
 put it on her back. While in this position, she had 
 no power to hold up her milk, for it came down 
 freely. After doing this a few times, and afterwards 
 putting my hand on the back of the cow, it would 
 give way and she would immediately give down her 
 milk." 

The rationale of this treatment appears to be that 
 the weight counteracts the upward tendency of the 
 animal's muscular action. 

The Clinton Grape* 

I have before me, January 25th, a bunch of the 
 above desirable, long-keeping variety, as fresh and 
 perfect as it came from the vine. It has been 'cXilti- 
 vated in the vicinity of Rochester for the last twenty 
 or twenty-five years; yet it is still but little known, 
 although worthy of a more general cultivation on 
 account of its hardiness and productiveness. It is 
 the grape for the North, where no other variety ri- 
 pens. Even with us, (latitude 4Sdeg.,) in backward 
 seasons, this is the only variety that attains complete 
 maturity. I would particularly recommend it to 
 wine-makers as worthy of trial. My opinion is, that 
 before many years it will be extensively cultivated 
 as a wine grape. Judging from the character of 
 its juice, the wine will require a longer time to ripen 
 than that of the Isabella and Catawba, and will keep 
 much lotiger than either. It succeeds well in all dry 
 situations, and is entirely free from rot, to which the 
 Catawb.a is particularly subject. 
 ■ It is a matter of surprise that the wine-makers of 
 the West, some of whom have-been making such ac- 
 tive search for native grapes, have not turned their 
 attention to tliis variety. I have not seen it mention- 
 ed in any of their reports. I am informed, howev- 
 er, that it is now in the course of being tested there, 
 and that a quantity of the grapes have been sent 
 from this plaoo tj a.i eminent wine maker, to be tes- 
 ted as .1 ..r wine-producing qualities. We-may, 
 therefore, expect a report soon. 

The vino grows rapidly, and is propagated easily, 
 striking more readily from cuttings than any other 
 variety I know in the whole catalogue of popular na- 
 tive and foreign sorts. The shoots are slender and 
 wiry, ripening so well as to acquire great firemness, 
 and hence it is so hardy that the severe cold of a 
 northern winter never aliects even the softer parts of 
 the young shoots. 

Wood — grayish brown and short-jointed; leaves — 
 small and thin, sharply serrated, and unlike Isabella 
 and Catawba, which are usually turned backwards, 
 they have more of a concave form. Bunches — small 
 and compact, resembling much the Black Cluster. 
 Berries — small to medium, black, juicy, with consid- 
 erable pulp, rather acid when first gathered, even 
 though ripe. They improve by keeping, jnst as 
 Winter pears will by house-ripening. It is a pro- 
 digious bearer, and ripens in equal situations two or 
 three weeks before the Isabella.— [Horticulturist.
