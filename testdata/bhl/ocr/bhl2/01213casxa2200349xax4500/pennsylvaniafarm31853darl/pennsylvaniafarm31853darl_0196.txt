PREJUDICES OF FARMERS.

the laboi-s of others, — he it is, who is the practical 
 sailor. . 

If then, iu the hour of dan;;er, when death rages 
 for his prey, and the yawning sea shows the ready 
 grave, men acknowledge the might of mind; why is 
 it, that formers will persist in undervaluing it, and 
 set up sinews before it? 

As we oast our eyes over 'the country, we see it 
 ■ traversed in every direction by roads of iron; migh- 
 ty hills are demolished, wide valleys are filled up,and 
 swift streams are spanned by viaducts. The neigh 
 of the steam-horse wakes the echoes, far and near; as 
 with eyes, of fire and with breath of pitchy smoke, 
 he rushes along his iron road with the roar and 
 strength of the avalanche. Now if there are things 
 that practical man can suroly do, the piling of dirt 
 and stones into a long narrow heap; and the digging 
 down of banks of earth; and the hammering ol iron, 
 and tlie putting together of bolts and nuts, and 
 pjates, must be among them. But we do not give to 
 the thousands of brawny workmen, who ply pick 
 and spade, the honor of building the railroad; nor do 
 we credit to the faitliful smith, wlio obedient to di- 
 rections, has wrought out a rod, and again iiaramer- 
 ed out a p ate, the performances of the finished loco- 
 motive. . 

By and by, — as all now admit that a man may be 
 a finished practical sailor, who does not defile his 
 palms with pitch, oakum, or rattlin-stufiF; and as one 
 may claim to be a practical builder, renring huge 
 structures of granite, bridging rivers, and moving 
 mountains, who does not harden his hands by the 
 use of spade, pick', or crow; so we will acknowledge 
 that a man niay be a practical fiirmer, competent to 
 the management of acres, who does not toil all the 
 day long at the piow-tail. To farm well, as to direct 
 any other operation well, the foreman, whether he be 
 master or inan, must thoroughly understand how 
 things ought to be done; and then the proverb will 
 be fouud to hold true of farming, as of must things 
 else, — "the eye of the master is of more value than 
 his hands." 

Scientific Agriculture is the cultivation of the 
 eirth by rule, and not by guess work. Indeed, when 
 and where guessing ends and system begins, then 
 and there is, the birth, and, the birth place of Sci- 
 ence. ' 

How many farms, gentlemen, within the reach of 
 your observation, are, by this definiti n scientifical- 
 ly cultivated ? On how many is the depth of the 
 plowing gauged by the depth of the soil, the charac- 
 ter of the subsoil, and a wise intention to render the 
 fertile loam deeper year after year, inch by inch ? 
 How many farmers of your acquaintance, who enter 
 on a farm with a soil three inches deep, undertake, 
 as they well and easily might, to render it in twelve 
 yijars, twelve inches deep ? I would tell you here, 
 that the experiments of thousands of farmers have 
 proved that by thrusting the point of your plow 
 one inch, or three-quarters of an inch .deeper at 
 each plowing and bringing to the surface so much of 
 the inert subsoil, to be operated on by the atmos- 
 phere and to be benefitted by the manure year after 
 year, you will to this extent increase your active fer- 
 tile soil, and gradually create another farm, as it 
 were, under your old one. But this would be scien- 
 tific farming; and, consequently, iu the opinion of 
 too many farmers, mere nonsense; notwithstanding 
 that fa,ots, plenty as blackberries, confront th'.;m with 
 evidence. 

On how many fivrms in this State, or in any State, 
 is the manure applied with sufficient knowledge, of 
 the component parts,- and consequently of the wants 

of the soil ? On how many is the manure itself pre- 
 pared and preserved, so that it retains all of its valu- 
 able constituents ? Why, gentlemen, if one were to 
 say that plants, to thrive, require food in certain pro- 
 portions; and that if one of the necessary substances 
 is not present in the soil, and is not supplied in the 
 manure, the plant cannot thrjvfe; and that in propor- 
 tion as you have or apply the precise quantity of each 
 ingredient necessary, so nearly do you come to gett- 
 ing the maximum crop, — you would set it down at 
 once, in scorn, as scientific farming. And yet how 
 else do you account for the fact, that one man grows 
 a hundred bushels of corn to an acre and another 
 but twenty? Why, clearly because theground whereon 
 grew the hundred bushels was naturally, or by sci- 
 entific treatment, in a proper condition for corn bear- 
 ing, — had in its womb all the necessary kinds, and 
 enough of each kind of food, that the young and the 
 growing plant required for its leaves, its stalk, its 
 tassel and its ear. And how do you account for the 
 fact, that you do not get an equal crop on the same 
 gro.ind the next year? Because the first crop has 
 eateu up a good share of the food in the ground-pan- 
 try; and the third season, (if any man is silly enough 
 to try corn on the, same ground, without having sup- 
 plied food by manure,) the tliird crop would find the 
 s'helves pretty well cleaned; and the progeny of that 
 year would be pigmies. 

On how many farms in New Hampshire is an ac- 
 curate calculation made of the cost of growing diif- 
 erent crops, so as to decide which is the most profit- 
 able to raise ? On how many farms is an account 
 kept of outlay and income from each field and each 
 animal, that the prudent husbandman may know 
 where is the mouse-hole in his meal-bin ? This is not 
 because it would be scientific farming. To be sure, 
 a merchant who pretended to carry on an extensive 
 btisiness without keeping books, and without taking 
 now and then "an account of stock;" or who would 
 continue to deal in certain styles of goods, without 
 knowing whether he was making or losing money 
 by the operation, would be held insane. But surely 
 that is no reason why a man who prides himself on 
 being a plain practical farmer, should farm by aritli,- 
 metic. , ■ 

Do farmers hereabout, or farmers 'generally any- 
 where, attempt gradually to improve their seed by 
 early and judicious •selection; and by always plant- 
 ing the best, instead of reserving the worst for that 
 purpose; or do they sell all that is fit to be sold, and 
 keep the poorest for home use and for seed ? This 
 gradual improvement of seed, such as Mr. Brown, on 
 an island in Lake Winnepesaukee has made in corn 
 — known as Brown corn — and as many others have 
 made in manv plants, and fruits, and flowers, by the 
 simple selection of seed, with judicious cultivation, 
 — this smacks rather, too much of science, for a prac- 
 tical farmer. 

Scientific Agriculture recognizes the fact, that ma- 
 nures are economically applied, to exert their best 
 influences, upon soils where water too much abounds; 
 and recommends drainage. "And so," say you, 
 "does every practical farmer, who knows beans." 
 Well, perhaps every practical farmer does not "know 
 beans," or he would recognize them in a good share 
 of the ready-brfi'ued cnffi'e that he buys ! At any 
 rate, how difierent the opei-ations of the systematic 
 and of the guess-work drainer. The first discovers 
 the secret springs, that .supply the superfluity of 
 water; and so locates his drains, and so to cut off the 
 vein before it opens on the surface. While nine- 
 tenths of your practical men dig ditches in the low- 
 est part of the meadow, where the water stands; —
