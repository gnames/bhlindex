But, it is the intrduction of Guano that is working 
 out an agricultural revolution in our Commonwealth. 
 Many farms that were considered worn out have 
 been entirely paid for by the first er6p of wh?at, af- 
 ter the application of Guano. And in several in- 
 stances within my knowledge, forms that five years- 
 ago you could scarcely give away, are now worth 
 twenty-five dollars an acre, and increasing yearly in 
 value. 

I have no hesitation in saying that, if the supply 
 of Guano holds out, and the use of it by our farmers 
 continue? to increase in the same ratio during the 
 next five years that it has for a year or two past, the 
 real estate o{ our .Commonwealih will be worth five 
 times as much as it is at present. Even down in 
 "Sandy Sussex," where, as the story goes, the sand 
 is so thick that the farmer, after he is done plowing 
 in the evening, has to hang his plow on the fence in 
 order to find it next morning, there tire some signs of 
 improvement; nevertheless, when the Farm Journal 
 finds its" way down there — like a goodmissionary in 
 heathen lands — it will find an ample field for labor 
 in dispelling the "darkness that covers the land, and 
 the gross darkness the people," — aijricullural "dark- 
 nes," I mean, of course. But, more anon. 
 Yours, &c.,

 Cross-Drilling Wheat. 

Newark, Del., Aug. 16th, 1853. 

J. Lacet Darlington, Esq. 

Dear Sir: — As the time 
 for seeding wheat is fast approaching, I feel it my 
 duty to give some hints to your numerous readers of 
 the Farm Journal, on the raising or growing of this 
 crop. 

1 last year drilled twenty-five acres of land in 
 wheat, nine acres of which was clover sod, the hal- 
 lance sixteen acres consisted of oats stubble.' 

I will now give to your readers the method in 
 which I planted my grain. I plowed my sod ground 
 about the middle of August, plowing under a heavy 
 crop of clover; the depth of the plowing about eight 
 inches. I then let it remain untouched until the 
 12th of September; then I broad-aasted about four 
 hundred pounds of No. 1 Peruvian Guano, per acre, 
 on the top of the plowed ground, and used the heavy 
 spike harrow over it three times, then put on a heavy 
 roller, which finished it for the drill. 1 commenced 
 drilling on the 18th of September, drilling it .both 
 ways, or whjit would be termed cross-drilling; sow- 
 ing each time IJ bushels per acre, and making 2 J- 
 bushels per acre. This seems heavy seeding, and so 
 it is, but the result was a good yield, I averaged from 
 this field about 47 bushels per acre. 

Field No. 2, oata stubble, 16 acres, I plowed in Ju- 

ly, depth 9 inches, and harrowed it once to level it. 
 I then plowed' it again .in Septefnber, in lands the 
 usual width six steps, plowing my manure underj 
 there being about eight acres of this field composted, 
 the balance guanoed, 300 lbs. to the acre, plowed 
 down as was the compost. I then harrowed it three 
 times with a heavy spike harrow, and rolled as be- 
 fore, which made it ready for the drill. I then com- 
 menced drilling it, but the one way, sowing 2 bush- 
 els per acre, and Unishod this field on the 23d day of 
 ■September. The yield from this field was good, av- 
 erage per aero, about 31 bushels, which may be con- 
 sidered a good crop. 

But I feel a strong disposition-to recommend to my 
 fellow farmers, the principle of drilling both ways, 
 as 1 have tried it for the last three years, and find it 
 to yield from 7 to 10 bushels and more, per acre, on 
 the same land and in the same field. 

In conclusion, I would again recommend drilling 
 twice, one bushel each time, and the free use of Gu- 
 ano—one hundred pounds for the benefit of the fly, 
 and three hundred for your self, and I will insure a 
 good crop,, if tilled as above stated. 

I am sir, your,_obedient servant,

Guano, Nitrate of Soda, &c. 

To THE Editors of the Farm JonRNAL: — Two yeais 
 ago I mixed 200 lbs. of guano, (for .which I paid §5,) 
 with 3 bushels of plaster, and put it round the stocks 
 on four acres of corn, after it had got up, and previ- 
 ous to being harrowed. I found the corn more vig- 
 orous than that which had no guano and only plas- 
 ter, though on the same quality of soil; the cobs were 
 larger, and I believe I was repaid for my outlay of 
 five dollars. 

This year I have mixed 120 pounds of nitrate of 
 soda, (which cost me i?3 90,) with 3 bushels of plas- 
 ter. (I had the nitrate of soda ground in the mill 
 like plastef.) I put it also in the same manner as be- 
 fore, on four acres of corn. During the dry weath-' 
 or we had in the Spring, I found the nitrate of soda 
 had no effect, but since we have had copious rains, 
 the effect shows itself most wonderfully. The corn 
 is dark green,' and the growth vigorous, more so than 
 the effect of the guano was. I expeqt to be paid 
 over and over for my outlay, |3 90. 

I communicate you, sir, this fact, with the request 
 to bq so good to induce the Philadelphia merchants 
 to import this article, the nitrate of soda, more free- 
 ly. I Ijave been informed it is found in abvin- 
 dance in South America, and can be imported by the 
 cargo at ?35 a ton. It is the nittogcn the grand des- 
 ideratum to the growth of plant?. It is my opinion 
 it will superi?ede the guano. It is in a pure state, 
 no adulteration or fraud can be practised with it, as 
 much as guano. According to Mr. Paschall Morris,
