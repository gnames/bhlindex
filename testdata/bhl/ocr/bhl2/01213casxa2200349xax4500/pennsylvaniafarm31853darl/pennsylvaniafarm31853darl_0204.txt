LADIES DEPARTMENT. 

[September 

To set a. good example, therefore, I will ask a place 
 in our department for a New York reoeipe that I 
 have tested for some years past,' and I find very use- 
 ful and convenient. It is a substitute for yeast in 
 making biscuit, muffins, buckwheat cakes, &o., &c., 
 and is far preferable to saleratus, or any of the "yeast 
 powders," advertised in the shops. This "compound" 
 is the invention of C. N. Bement, of Albany, a dis- 
 tinguished agriculturist and author, and now propri- 
 etor of the Albany city steam mills. 

I happened to be visiting a friend on the Hudson, a 
 few years since, and became so much interested in 
 the very fine biscuit, corn-bread, &o., which daily 
 graced her table, that I could'nt rest easy till I be- 
 came initiated in all the mysteries of their production. 
 I noticed, that in thirty minutes from the time she 
 entered the kitchen, the biscuit were made up, baked, 
 and on the table. This is one of the very desii-uble 
 characteristics of the ''compound." For, how often, 
 does "company" drop in on us unexpectedly, about 
 tea-time, and perhaps, when we have nothing but 
 stale bread in the house. Then- it is that the com- 
 pound cin be brought most advantageously to the res- 
 cue, and in half an hour, biscuit may be laid before 
 our guests, as li.ijlit, wholesome, and as good, in ev- 
 ery respect, as can be made from yeast or otherwise. 

In using this compound, great care must be 
 taken to mix it thoroughly with the dry flour. This 
 is best done by shaking it through a small seive over 
 the flour with one hand, while the flour is stirred with 
 the other, and then passing the mixture once or 
 twice through the seive. Much depends on this op- 
 eration for its success. ■ ", 

To Make Biscuit. 

Take one quart of flour, four tea-spoonsful of the 
 compound,a little sa^t; -mix thoroughly as above; then 
 add one pint of sour cream and knead into doughy 
 not very hard. Bake in a quick oven, not over twen- 
 ty minutes, ^f sour cream cannot be had, rub a lump 
 of butter the size of a hen's egg iato the flour, a,nd 
 pour in a pint of milk, as a substLtutff.'-^j-'-''^**'* " 
 Buckwheat Cakes.' 

To three pints of Ijuckwheat flour put four tea- 
 spoonsful of the compound, and a little salt; mix by 
 sifting, as for biscuit; make a batter and commence 
 baking as soon as thoroughly mixed. One great ad- 
 vantage in this method is, that the batter is ready for 
 baking as soon as it is made, and the cakes are sure 
 to be light. The cakes will brown better by mixing 
 a little corn meal, and substituting milk for water 
 in mixing: 

Muffins and Corn-Bread 
 Are made in the usual way — merely substituting the 
 compound (by mixing with the dry meal asabove,)for 
 yeast, and baking as soon as made up. 

I ought to state, Mr. Editor, for the information of 
 your readers in this neighborhood, that the compound 
 was ordered at my request, by one of your West 

Chester merchants, Mr. Wm. P. Townsend, and is 
 for sale at his store. It is one of those little conve- 
 nienciesin our domestic economy that has only to be 
 known to be appreciated, and as such I recommend it 
 to the notice of every good

How to do up Shirt Bosoms. 

We have often heard ladies expressing a desire to 
 know by what process the fine gloss on new linens, 
 shirt bosoms, &j., is produced, and in order to gratify 
 them, we subjoin the following receipe: 

Take two ounces of fine white gum arable powder 
 — put it into a pitcher, and pour on it a pint or more 
 jf boiling water, (according to the degree of strength 
 you desire,) and then having covered it, let it set all 
 night — in the morning, pour it carefully from the 
 dregs into a clean bottle, cork it, and keep it for use. 
 A tablespoonful of gum water, stirred into a pint of 
 starch made in the usual manner, will give to lawns 
 — either white or printed — a look of newness when 
 nothing else can restore them after washing.

Women's Bights. 

Delaware Countv, Aug. 3d, 1853. 

Mr. Editor: — 

I trust that the dish of sentiment 
 and poetry, that you have cooked up for your fair 
 correspondent of Westmoreland county, is intended 
 for her .alone, and if she is willing to march up to 
 the canaon's mouth, to maintain the rights of women 
 to be a satellite around the dinner pot, mending stock- 
 ings,^., which appears to be your idea of "Woman's 
 Plights,'' I have first to learn that man has ever de- 
 nied her tjiose rights; but when a woman has done 
 up all the chores, why may she not as well regale 
 her mind, on -the pages of an Agricultural or Horti- 
 cultural work, as set dovva to sentiment or poetry? 
 What kind of mothers would such women make, for 
 ■j««)i, 'whose intellect is to control the destinies of a 
 natioji. 

Does not your Journal advocate high breeding for 
 cattle and stock ? Is it not important that the female 
 animal should equal the male ? Will any stock rais- 
 er attempt to raise from degenerate and inferior 
 mothers? and if they do, what is the consequence ? 
 What folly to suppose man is an exception to the 
 great law of nature. 

If you must have a "Ladies' Department,'' appeal 
 to woman as a reasonable being, that she shall insist 
 upon high inrellectual culture, high physical train- 
 ing, to fit her for her high destiny as mother of man, 
 not his servant and toy. 

Tis to be hoped the ladies of your own county 
 have minds to appreciate something more than senti- 
 ment, poetry, or cooking receipts, all well enough in 
 their placos,but if they most have the first two, there 
 is no lack of trashy publications filled with them, with- 
 out introducing them into the Farm Journal.
