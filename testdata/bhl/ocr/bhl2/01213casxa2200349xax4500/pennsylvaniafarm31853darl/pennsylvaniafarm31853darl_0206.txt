SPJiCIAL REPORT 
 .Oftlte, Entomological Committee. 

AUQUST 15TH, 1653. 
 To the President of Penna. Ilort. Society :— 

The Committee on Entomology respectfully Report, That their at- 
 tention has recently been directed to several insects, of which speci- 
 mens, in various stages of transformation, were received from mem- 
 bers of the Society. . . ■ 

1. a species of coccus, or Scale Insect, of the Apple tree; a noxious 
 Bark Louse, which injures the tree by sdcliing the Juices from the 
 branches to which It is permanently attached. They are of a brown 
 color, about one-tenth of an inch in length, of an oblong oval form, 
 and gregarious in their habits. Where they are crowded together in 
 great numUers,on thu limbs and branches, as is often the case, the 
 growth of the tree is materially impaired, and its Ufe endangered. Br. 
 T. "W. Harr.s, in his able -Report on the Insects of Massachusetts in- 
 jurious to vegetation," recommends, as. the best remedy for its destruc- 
 tion,' 'a wash inade of two parts of soft soap and eight of water, with 
 which is to be mixed lime enough to bring it to the consistence of 
 thick-whitewash." This application, is to be put on with a brush, to 
 the limbs affected, "in the early part of June, when the insects are 
 young and tender." "We have also used, with entire success, in the 
 winter, the whale oil soap, applied with a hard bruth. 

2. Carpocapsa Pomonella, or Apple Moth. This is the insect which 
 disfigures so many of our apples, and causes such numbers of them to 
 fall prematurely from the ti'ee. Mr. Ewcns, a member of our Society, 
 in pjassiiig through his*orehard, pulled up a sod of grass, and laid it in 
 the crotch of an apple tree. Subsequeully, he found it to be full of 
 cocoons, which proved to belong to the insect in question. In this 
 case, the apple worms, as is usual with them, had left the fruit, aj"ter 
 they had attained'their full larval growth, (some of them whilst it was 
 on the tree, and others after it had fallen,; to talfe refuge in the crevices 
 of the trunk., But finding a convenient sheltei; in the tuft of grass, 
 they availed themselves of it. Dr. Harris has recojainiended old cloth 
 tO'Ve used for tlys purpose; and it is evident that ii these facts be 
 taken advantage of when the infected ap;iles begin, to drop premature- 
 ly, the summer and'autumnal broods may be materially diminished. 
 It is of most importance to itteud to the latter brood, wUioli furnishes 
 thejndividuals that live through the winter, and thus preserve the 
 species for another year. 

3. Aphis (Pemphigus) Stamineus, This name is proposed for a large 
 species of Aphis, which forms follicles on the leaves of the siiver- 
 leaved Maple (.Acereriocarpum). The specimens were sent to us by 
 our ex-President, Caleb Cope. Esq. This curious Aphis appears to be 
 a new species. Dr. Fitch, in the descriptions of the New York State 
 Cabinet, mentions the European Aphis aceris as occurring in New 
 York, and may have this wooly species in view. But the dedcriptlon 
 of the foreign one does not mention the remarkable niaments which 
 approximate the insect to certain tropical forms. Both sexes are cov- 
 ered with white down, and have abunch of white liliments posteriorly, 
 some' of w'hich are three-fourths of an inch long, a character in which 
 this species surpasses the Eriosoma'of the apple tree. Malb.— Black, 
 feet long, slender and rufous; Tarsi hi articulate; wings sli:;htly dc- 
 flexed, translucent, pale ferruginous at the base; submarglnal nervure 
 conspicuous, black, and ending in along stigma; disc with four simple 
 uervures; posterior wings witli three nervures; Mesojiotum polished, 
 with a deep Y-shaped impression; abdomen without tubes; Promuscts 
 obsolete: antennieG— articulate, the first two short, the 3d long, and 
 the 4th, 5th, (3th, gradually lengthening; Icagth of the body 1^^ lines, 
 ■or to the end of the wings 2>2. Fi;MAL(i and pupa— Apterous, dark red- 
 dish brown, feet paler; i-'romuscis twice as long as the head, thickyiicd 
 near the apex; length l>a Hues.
