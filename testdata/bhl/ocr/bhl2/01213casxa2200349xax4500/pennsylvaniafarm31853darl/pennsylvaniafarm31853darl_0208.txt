APPLES FOR MILCH COWS 

[October 

nure held by that small river in solution, that tho 
 Tast increase of grass is produced. 

By watering, Mr. Kennedy, of Myremill, keeps 
 close up, in a thousand head of stock on ninety acres 
 of Italian rye-grass. In ordinary seasons, from five 
 to nine slieep can be kept on one acre of land; the 
 latter may be done in a drooping season, on clover 
 lays, on well cultivated land; but with the aid of a 
 little artificial food and by the application of liquid 
 manure, in the shower form, by steam, Mr. Kennedy, 
 can keep fifty-six sheep per acre! Nor can we believe 
 that it is altogother due to the manure. To that it is 
 partly owing, doubtless; but it is by far more owing 
 to its being watered with that manure in a soluble 
 8tate,and so fit it for the immediate use of the plants. 
 Hence he is independent of season. The water-drill 
 to which we before alluded, is an application of the 
 same principle; and the wonderful results of the 
 dressing of dissolved bone liquid, in a very dry sea- 
 son, by the Duke of Kichmond, is a powerful fact in 
 the same direction. 

That it is the want of soluble manure, or, in other 
 ■words, elements of plants, which is mainly the cause 
 of the injury, is manifest from the fact that all the 
 'poorest land has suffered by tar tho most from the 
 drought. The very highly manured land has sus- 
 tained the least damage; while on land to which very 
 highly soluble manures, Peruvian guano, for in- 
 stance, and similar materials, have ueen applied, the 
 erops are growing vigorously. 

Nor let it be forgotten that the rain brings down 
 the ammonia, which, in dry states of tho atmosphere, 
 will float undisturbed; and this failing, as well as 
 the soluble supply below, would of course aggravate 
 the cause of injury. 

But what can now be done, with the meadows ripe, 
 and not one-half or one-third of a crop ? We say, 
 free your pastures at once, and put in the whole ol 
 the stock, if rain has come, and eat up the meadows 
 thoroughly bare. This will amply relieve the pas- 
 tures, and afford them the chance of an entire new 
 growth. The meadows, with their small produce, 
 will soon be eaten up; and let a dressing of two or 
 three cwt. of the best guano be then applied to them, 
 and a beautiful new crop, and not very late, will yet 
 be secured; the mowing machine and haymaker will 
 soon get it, even if it should clash with the harvest; 
 but we are clear that on all kinds of land more pro- 
 duce, with the present crop given in, will be obtain- 
 ed by such a course, and the present crop will be 
 very acceptable of itself. The fog, or aftermath, has 
 also every prospect of being tetter after thus sup- 
 plying the deficieucy of the year. — [Mark Lane Ex-

Apples for Milch Cows. 
 We have long been satisfied that one of the best and 
 most profitable crops which any land o .nor could 
 raise,is sweet apples for milch cows. Late in autumn 
 all cows shrink very much in the quantity of milk 
 they afford, more especially as soon as the sharp 
 night frosts destroy the succulence of the pastures. 
 It is at this period that moderate feedings of sw<;et 
 apples, say six quarts given morning and evening, 
 have restored the quantity of milk and increased its 
 richness; and a great advantage has resulted where a 
 M supply could be bad for feeding through winter. An 
 unfavorable opinion of apples, as a food for cows, has 
 sometimes arisen from the furious over-feeding of 
 half starved animals, who have accidently broken 
 into orchards, and brought on disease, fever, and 
 consequent drying of the milk by immoderate gorg- 

ing, — a reason for renouncing such food, would as 
 well apply to the exclusion of oats from horses and 
 cold water from men, because they are sometimes in- 
 jured by an excess. 

Amid the profusion of tree-planting of late years, 
 we are surprised to see so few orchards set out for 
 feeding domestic animals, by a selection of some par- 
 ticular varieties especially adapted to this very pur- 
 pose. We want a different sort from those ordinari- 
 ly selected for table use, ■which are admired for their 
 pleasant and delicate flavor; while a stock-feeding 
 apple should be in the first place, a free grower and 
 most abundant bearer; nest, of firm and rather dry 
 texture, and of rich but not delicate flavor. If dry 
 and firm, they are more easily gathered without bruis- 
 ing, more easily kept from fVeezing.and contain more 
 substantial nutriment than light, juicy, tender sorts. 
 And as a general rule, such apples are the best keep- 
 ers, — take, for example, the firm and dry English 
 and Roxbury Russets, and the Black Gilliflower, the 
 latter of which has been already proved a good sort 
 for Spring feeding, and would be still better if per- 
 fectly sweet. The present is likely to be one of the 
 most abundant fruit seasons ever known; and we be- 
 lieve that a more acceptable service could not be ren- 
 dered by pomologists to the enlightened agricultural 
 public, than a thorough examination among the in- 
 numerable native apples, for a pre-eminently pro- 
 ductive sort, adapted to stock feeding. 

Would it not be -n'oll worthy the attention of a State 
 Agricultural Society, to ofi'er liberal premiums for 
 the best, second, and third new variety tliat should 
 be presented for this purpose, the decision to be 
 founded on a bushel placed before the awarding com- 
 mitee, accompained 'with statements, properly au- 
 thenticated, of the size and age of the tree, treat- 
 ment, present crop, and former character for bear- 
 ing? 

We should like to see something of this kind at- 
 attempted, instead of perpetually repeating the same 
 old premiums on what has been well known for a 
 quarter or half a century, all through the land. 

It is the cheapness of tho apple crop, when thus 
 raised under the most favorable circumstances, that 
 strongly commends it to the attention of stock-rais- 
 ers. A very prolific sort will bear five times the 
 quantity of the ordinary average of table apples; and 
 forty such on an acre of land might be ea^ily made 
 to average ten bushels each annually. The Rhode 
 Island Greening, in Western New York, has in re- 
 peated instances, in a single neighborhood, yielded 
 forty bushels per ti-ee; and in New England the Bald- 
 win has yielded over fifty bushels. Ten busliels per 
 tree, then, for sorts especially chosen for productive- 
 ness, must be a moderate estimate — amounting to 
 400 bushels per acre annually. If fifty dollars is 
 paid for an acre of ground, and ten dollars for forty 
 young trees and transplanting, the crops from the 
 ground will p.ay interest and cultivation till the trees 
 themselves begin to afford remuneration. Sixty doll- 
 ars, therefore, will pay for a bearing orchard; but 
 admitting its cost to be eighty dollars, and the annu- 
 al plowing, harrowing and manuring, to be ten doll- 
 ars annually; the whole yearly cost of the apple crop 
 will be fifteen dollars and sixty cents, at seven per 
 cent, interest. That is, it will be a little below ^wHr 
 cents per btmhel, on the tree. 

No other crop can be raised with so little labor — 
 an important consideration for a country where wa- 
 ges are so high, where no annual planting is needed, 
 and whore the annual cult'ivaticn, entirely dispensing 
 with hoeing, consists only of a single plowing, and a
