CONCENTKATED MANURES. 

Concentrated Manurtsi 
 The following excellent and appropriate remai-ks, 
 we copy from the English Agricultural Gazette, l)nt 
 they are also perhaps more especially adapted to the 
 practice of farmers in our own country. The absolute, 
 waste of fertilizing materials, on some of our best 
 managed farms, and the great loss annually sustain- 
 ed in the management of barn-yard manure, are 
 truly enormous, and we commend the articlg to our 
 readers. 

The introduction and general use of conoSntr'ated 
 manures, both of natural and artificial origi'n, form 
 oie of the most remarkable features in the modern 
 history of agricultuie. Twenty yearsago farm-yard 
 dung, hme, and bones constituted the simple and 
 nearly sole sources whence the farmer obtained his 
 supply ef fertilising substances. Now, howerer, sci- 
 ence and perverted ingenuity— if such a conjunction 
 can be tolerated in one sentence — have multiplied 
 manures to such an extent that the chief difficulty 
 the non-soientiiic farmer has to encounter is how 
 and what to select, where the choice is so varied in 
 its objects, and so complicated in its nature l)y puffin^ 
 advertisements, every adjective of which is a supei" 
 lative, and every sentence and statement an illust-ra- 
 tion of that style of language familiarly known as 
 the hyperbole. Already are the stock-phrases of the 
 turj introduced into our advertising vocabulary in 
 the shape of unanswerable and all-argumeut-delyinn' 
 bets of liundreds of pounds sterling, as to the virtues 
 of a certain manure; and by and by wo may proba- 
 bly see some bold innovator of the Moses & Son's 
 style, retaining a doggerel rhymster to rehearse in 
 verse, the superiority of his super-excellent super 
 phosphate, manufactured, however, not from bones 
 or coprolites, but from the Hampshire hill ; and also 
 of his genuine amm.nieal guano, deposited, not by 
 the sea-birds of the Pacific, but by the quiet waters 
 of the Eocene period, ifi the chalk basin which holds 
 the Loudon clay. 

"Were farmers wise, adulteration is a n-ame that 
 manure dealers would not often play at," cmitains an 
 advice not less impurtant to the agricultural commu- 
 nity than that pithy maxim from which it is parodied 
 18 to the body politic. The question, "what has 
 chemistry done for agriculture?" is ocoasionallv ask- 
 ed in a disparaging and doubtful tone by some dis- 
 appointed and despairing practical man; but a much 
 more pertment query would be to enquire candidlv 
 "A\ hat practical benefits have farmers, as a class' 
 endeavored to obtain from chemistry ?" ,So far as 
 the former question is concerned, we need only to 
 compare the condition of British agriculture as it 

^f\^^} TT^'^^Y}^ '' ^° ^^^^' '-^ be ccnvinced 
 of the fact that, had chemistry not been brought to 
 bear upon it during the intervening period, we must 
 still have been g-oping in the dark for the simplest 
 principles upon which the manufacture and applica- 
 tion ot manure are based. If chemistry has done 
 nothing for agriculture beyond merely suggesting the 
 making of super phosphate of lime, this country 
 has paid very dear tor the now nearly time-worn dis- 
 covery of a German chemist; and i,ur great a-n-icu'l- 
 tural societies have been and are still lavishing'^funds 
 that might bo better employed, if it be true that the 
 only laurel wluch British science lias yet been able 
 to wreath around tho brow of agriculture is the gift 
 01 a loreigner. ° 

But to many of our readers who have Lad practi- 
 cal and substantial proofs of tho power ot chemistry 

[October 

to render good service to agriculture, any defence of 
 this science must seem a work of supererogation- 
 still, there are others who are either wilfully or ig- 
 norant y blind to the f\vct that it is to it that vve owe 
 not only the introduction of many new manures and 
 protection against fraudulent dealers, but also soun- 
 der views regarding the management and application 
 of the contents of our tanks, boxes, and straw-yards. 
 While we would yield to the practical man any merit 
 that may be aftitched to the first employment of' guano 
 in tarm practice, yet Ivs experiments and results 
 however successfully carried on and concluded, could 
 never have suggested the use of any one of the many 
 fertilizing substances which chemical investigatioi, 
 has discovered The chemist has pointed out and 
 specified the elements of which guano is composed, 
 and in addition to this information, he has taught 
 us that IS fertilizing principles are not mi genS-U, 
 but are distributed m very groat profusion over the 
 lengtli and breadth of the United Kingdom, and 
 have long been, aud still are, intentionally and unin- 
 tentionally permitted to run to worse than waste un- 
 der our very noses-not secretly or stealthily, but 
 with a most offensive obtrusiveness to every organ of 
 sense that can take cognisance of their presence 
 fi-very common or private sewer that discharges its 
 oonteuts into a running stream, every black pond 
 which receives the drainings of a farm-yard, and 
 every uncovered dunghill, are as certainly, at this 
 moment, dissipating the elements of fertility into the 
 ocean and atmosphere, as the guano ships are bring- 
 ing them to our shores.' Our country is thus not un- 
 like a patient laboring under chroAio heraorrh.age, 
 whose he and strength can only be sustained by a 
 large and constant supply of concentrated and stim- 
 ulating nourishment. That this wasting and waste- 
 lul disease of the "bo :y agricultural" is susceptible 
 of .an efi-eotual and radical cure, is what no one will 
 doubt who IS at all conversant with those principles 
 of economy which chai-acteriae our arts and manu- 
 lactures. 

If the waste materials f a factory or a foundry 
 pan be worked up anew into useful forms, so assured- 
 ly can those which are produced in the consumption 
 of our crops by man and beast. Proper.y speaking 
 there is no such thing in nature as waste; for every 
 process of growth and decay is but a series of loons 
 in that endless web in and within which the myste- 

nous functions of vegetable and animal life are com- 
 pleted and ever again "renewed— .ach generation 
 springing, phoenix-like, from the ashes of its prede- 
 cessor. Even the waste which human ignorance oc- 
 casions IS ultimately repaired by the diligent and 
 hriffy hand of nature; for, although the materials of 
 lenihty are to.all human appearance lost ibr ever in 
 the depths of the ocean or dissipated in the heights 
 ot the atmosphere, yet they are safely stored up lor 
 future use sometime and somewhere. Nature thus 
 strives hard to teach us wisdom; but we have been 
 slow to learn— slow to perceive that her principles 
 are imperatively uniform, and yet so flexible that, 
 like the elephant's trunk, they are capable of beino- 
 applied to thcsinallest as well as to the vastest ob''- 
 jects. It a farmer is so careless of the materials of 
 tertility which his own fam produces, or so ignorant 
 of their value as to permit them to ooze away into 
 rivers or be lost in the atmosphere, nature will take 
 care that they shall in some way contribute to the 
 geueral good; but to him who thus despises them, 
 they are logt to all intents and purposes. One pound 
 weight of ammonia from the Cl.incha islands is not 
 one whit more valuable than the same quantity vola- 
 tilised from a fermenting dunghill iu Britain; yet how
