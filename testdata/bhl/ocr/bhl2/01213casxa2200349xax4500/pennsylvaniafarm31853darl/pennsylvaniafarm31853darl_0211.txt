A Ijiquid Fertilizer for Choice Plants. 

BV AN AMATEUR. 

Dear Sir — I am confident that there are many of 
 your lady readers, and perhaps many of the other 
 sex, who are puzzled among tlie many (tew manures, 
 and having failed with some, and injured their plants 
 with others, they end by, raising only sickly and 
 meagre plants, when they might have thoni present- 
 ing a luxuriant aud satisfactory appearance — with 
 leaves of the darkest green, and flowers or fruit of 
 double the u ual size. 

Having made a trial for three years past, with a 
 perfectly safe and satisfactory liquid fertilizer, which 
 appears to suit all kinds of vegetation, which is 
 clean and easily applied, and procured without diffi- 
 culty, in any town, I confidently recommend it to 
 your readers, especially those who wish to give es- 
 pecial pains to, and get uncommon results from, cer- 
 tain favorite plants — either iu pots or in the open 
 garden — plants, whose roots are within such a mod- 
 derate compass, that they can be reached two or 
 three times a week, if not ofteuer, by the watering 
 pot. 

This liquid fertilizer is'made by dissolving half an 
 ounce of sulphate of ammonia in a gallon of water. 

Nothing so good can be cheaper, and the substance 
 may be obtained at aljnost any apothecary's. 

Now for the mode of using it. I may say, at the 
 outset, that weak as the solution appears to be, and 
 is, if plants are watered with it daily, they will die 
 — just as certainly as a man will who drinks nothing 
 but pure brandy. 

The right way to apply it is, to water the plant 
 with this solution every sixth time, the other five 
 times with plain water. 

The proportion is so simple, and the mode of using 
 it so easy to understand, that the most ignorant per- 
 son cannot possibly blunder about it — it lie can count 
 six. If we prepare the solution occasionally, and 
 water our plants iu pots every Saturday, with this 
 ammonia water, and all the rest of the time with 
 plain water, we shall have a safe rule. 

The result will, I am sure, both delight and sur- 
 prise every person who will make a trial of it. It 
 has become such an indispensable thing with me,that 
 I regularly mix a barrel of it every Ej-iday, and use 
 it on Saturday, upon any plants that I particularly 
 wish to invigorate and stimulate. I do not know that 
 I have seen a single instance of its disagreeing with 
 any plant — ammonia being the universal food of veg- 
 etation. Of course, the more rapid growing plants 
 — those with foliage that perspire a great deal — are 
 most strikingly benefitted by it. Ut course, also, 
 plants that are at rest, or not in a growing state 
 should nut be fed with it; but any plant that is about 
 starting, or is actually in a gr iwing stale, wilP not 
 fail to be wonderfully improved by it. Many plants 
 that have fallen into a sickly state by reason of poor, 
 or worn out soil, will usualUy, in the course of a 
 month, t.ike quite another aspect, aiid begin to de- 
 velope rich, dark green foliage I will enumerate 
 some of the things that I have bad great success 
 with. 

Strawberries. — Beds of indifi"crent appearance at 
 the opening of the Spring, last season, after being 

watered four times with this solution, grew very lux- 
 uriantly, and bore a crop ot remarkably fine fruit. 
 This year I have repented the experiment on half of 
 every bed; both foliage and blossoms are as large again 
 on the watered, as on the unwatered bed; and, by 
 way of comparison, I have watered some with plain 
 water also, and find, though rather benefited, for the 
 strawberry loves water, they have none of the extra 
 depth of verdure and luxuriance of those watered 
 with ammonia. 

Early Peas. — At least a week earlier than those 
 not watered, and much stronger in leaf and pod. 

Fuchsias. — A suprising effect is produced on this 
 plant, which, with the aid of ammonia water will 
 grow in very small pots, with a depth of verdure, a 
 luxuriance and a profusion and brilliancy of bloom, 
 that I have never seen equalled. Old and stunted 
 plants are directly invigorated by it. 

Dwarf Pears. — Some sickly trees,thatl have given 
 the best attention for three years previously, without 
 being able to get either good fruit or healthy foliage, 
 after being watered four times with the solution — of 
 course with the usual intermediate supply ol com- 
 mon water — became perfectly healthy and luxuriant, 
 aud have ever since (two years,) remained so. 

Dahlias. — ^^Whioh I have never succeeded well with 
 before, have dune beautifully with me since', flower- 
 ing most abundantly and lirilliantly, when watered 
 in this way. In all of out door plants, if mulching 
 is used, only half the quantity of plain water is need- 
 ed. For plants iu pots I consider it invaluable; and 
 gardeners who wish to raise specimen plants for ex- 
 hibition, will find this mode of watering thera every 
 sixth time with the solution, to produce a jierfection 
 ol growtli not to be surpassed in any other way.

Gigantic Cedar, 

There exists in California, says the Echo of the 
 Pacific, on one of the mountains of the country of 
 Calaveras, a Cedar said to be the largest tree in the 
 world. A correspondent of the Herald of Sonora, 
 who h IS paid a visit to the spot for the purpose of 
 examining this prodigy of the vegetable kingdom, de- 
 scribes it as follows: 

"At the level of the earth its circumference is 92 
 fe'et — 4 feet up, it is 88 feet — at 14 feet, it is Gl — and 
 thence it gradually tapers. . Its height in 285 feet; 
 and it has none of that deformity which commonly 
 characterises trees with enormous trunks. From 
 one end to the other it is a model of symmetry. The 
 age of this giant Cedar, counted by its zones, is 
 2520 years !" 

This king of the forests of the world is now having 
 its bark — which at the base is nearly 14 inches in 
 thickness — stripped away to a height of 50 feet, for 
 the purpose of being sent to the Great Exhibition in 
 New York. — [Athenaeum. 

Lima Beans. 

Lima Beans may be preserved so as to lie as palat- 
 able and green in mid Winter, as in August. Pull 
 and shell the beans a little younger than they are 
 usually gathered fur use in the Summer season. 
 Spread them thinly upon tiie floor of a giirret or an 
 airy light loft, and occasionally turn tlicm until they 
 ari' dry. Soak I hem twelve; hours before cooking, iu 
 warm water, and when cooked they will be as tender, 
 plump and "ood as at any season of the year. — Ex-
