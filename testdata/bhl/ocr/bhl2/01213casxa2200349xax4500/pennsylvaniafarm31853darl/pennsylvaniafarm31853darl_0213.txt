Chilsou's Patent Air Warming aud Ventilating 
 Apparatus. 

Amongst the improvements of the age there is no 
 one more deservedly worthy ot attention than the 
 thorough ventilation of our dwellings, school rooms, 
 churches, and workshops. Were it possible to ascer- 
 tain correctly the number of persons who die annual- 
 ly from the effects of imperfect ventillation, the ag- 
 gregate would astound many who now deem the sub- 
 ject scarcely worth a passing thought. The scarcity 
 and high price of fuel has eSFectually banished the 
 cheerful open fires of twenty years ago, and with 
 them a process of ventillation which, however imper- 
 fect, was greatly preferable to that now in use in 
 the very large raajoriiy of our buildings. Is it there- 
 fore a matter of surprise that our bills of mortality 
 show an increase pulmonary disease of truly alarm- 
 ing. Without pretending to any knowledge of med- 
 ical science, we venture the assertion that nine-tenths 
 of our consumptives have had the seed of their fatal 
 disease implanted in their systems by a want of well 
 yentilated school rooms, dwellings, and'places of bus- 
 iness. 

If this be so, (and who will question it,) it is high 
 time that attention was drawn more closely to the 
 subject. 

The production of a healthfnl atmosphere in those 
 places where daily avocations require our pres- 
 ence, while it seems to render our pursuits far more 
 attractive, exercises in addition, that more impoitant 
 lunction of supplying the lungs with food properly 
 adapted to their wants. 

We are pleased to observe that the difficulty which 
 has always stood in the way of heating dwellings in 
 combination with perfect ventilation, h.as at length 
 been effectually overcome, by the introduction of 
 Chilson's Air Warming and Ventillating Apparatus, 
 a cut of which is given below. 

itation in recommending it to the attention of out 
 readers. 

The following are among the important improve- 
 ments attained by this Apparatus: 

1st. An abundant supply of fresh, healthful, warm 
 air, free from red iron heat, so injurious to health. 

2d. The great power of this Apparatus in warming 
 buildings, is a conclusive proof that all the heat is 
 advantageously used in warming the rooms, which 
 accounts for its control in the economy of fuel. 

3d. By this Apparatus and the plan of setting the 
 same, there is not a possibility of setting the builc"- 
 ing on fire in which it is located. 
 4th. This Apparatus is completely adapted for burn- 
 ing any kind of fuel, anthracite or bituminous coal, 
 wood, &c. 

5th. The substantial material, and plan of con- 
 struction of this Apparatus, render it durable be- 
 yond a doubt for life time. 

6th. The facility and ease of management, and 
 ready access for cleaning out the Apparatus, &c., is 
 unsurpaised. 

7th. The plan for making the joints of the Appa- 
 ratus proof against the escape of smoke and gas, is 
 in every respect perfect. 

8th. Fire may be kept in this Apparatus from 
 Fall until Spring, by replenshing but once a day. 
 This Apparatus has been thorougly tested in all parts 
 of the country,and now declared to be the best in the 
 world. It has been awarded the highest premiums, 
 (gold and silver medals,) at the principal country 
 lairs and at the World's fair, London, it received the 
 Prize Medal, which with the unanimous reports in its 
 favor by the different committees of the State and 
 City Governments, (see their various printed reports,) 
 together with the certificates and recommendations 
 of more than seventeen hundred persons who have 
 them in use, (many of whom are professional gentle- 
 men, whose scientific attainments in such matters 
 are well and favorably known,) have combined to rer. 
 this Apparatus unrivalled in this country. The 
 World' Jury, at the London Fair, have also declared 
 it to be the best in the world. 

To be had of S. A. Harrison, 146 Walnut streeti

Having had an opportunity of testing, practically 
 the value of this excellent apparatus, we ieel no hos- 

Cattle for the East. 

The Buffalo Advertiser of the 16th ultimo, says: 
 "The receipts of cattle at this port have recently 
 been very large. On Wednesday night the freight 
 train on the Central ro,.d consisted of thirty-one cart 
 laden with cattlfe. On Thursday twenty-two cars, 
 and on Friday twenty-six cars similarly freiglitcd."
