The Advaiita^e:^ of Railruuds. 

A meeting of the Farmers' club, was recently held 
 in New York. After some desultory conversation on 
 the regular subject of tlie day — the benefit of rail- 
 roads to agriculuture — was taken up. 

Solon Robinson, the proposer of the question, re- 
 marked that he would say a few words by way of in- 
 troduction of the subjeec. The principal object I 
 had iu vie« in caUiu,:^ up this question was to. get 
 them to think how much agricultural improvement is 
 dependent upon and l)encticted by railroads. Places 
 that were almost desert and worthless barrens, have 
 been rendered productive, and lands increased in 
 value more than the whole cost of the road. 

Farmers often think, when a roail is first talked of, 
 that it will ruin their farms, but after it was once in 
 op .ration, and they finii how convenient it is to send 
 every thing eatable, (for every thing is eatable in the 
 city,) by the cars, they would be very unwilling to 
 do without its benefits; yet they do not, I kiiink, prop- 
 erly appreciate the benefits of railroads to agriculture. 
 In this city wo are very dependent uppn them for 
 our daily food: In one week, beef cattle .are tran.s- 
 mitted from their native prairie-lioma in Illinois to 
 this city. By the ordinary mode of travel they would 
 require from sixty to seventy days. Slilk, too, is 
 brought on the Harlem Railroad from Ciiatham 
 Four-Corners, l.')0 miles north of the city. Land 
 aUmg that r.^ad has risen from §'2-3 and 133) an acre, 
 to ijloO. Every kind of produce can be sent fresh_ 
 every day the same distance. Tons of blackberries 
 are gathere 1 from every nook and corner among the 
 rocks and hills adjacent to the railroads, which but 
 for the facility they affjrd, would have gone to feed 
 the birds instead of human stomachs. 

When railroads were first projected, farmers, who 
 used their own wagons logo to market, cried, ''we 
 shall be ruined," yet the more these lines of transpor- 
 tation are e<te.ided into the country the more pro- 
 duce they bring from distant places, the more salea- 
 ble their own becomes and at higher prices. Rail- 
 roads are not only beneficial to agriculture, but to civ- 
 ilization and the progressive improvement of the 
 whole human famil' . 

Judge Van Wyck made some remarks, and was 
 followed by Orang" Judd, Esq., one of the Editors 
 of "The Agricultor," who said he thought the sub- 
 ject was somew.iat misconceived about the opposition 
 of farmers to railroads. He thought that farmers 
 generally were in favor of the building of railroads. 

I'rofessor Mapes thought very differently — that the 
 strongest opposition almost everywhere did exist a- 
 mong farmers against the laying out ol railroads, 
 and that after they were in operation they did not 
 appreciate the benefits to agriculture which railroads 
 always conferred upon every coraiujuity through 
 which hey are constructed. Those who are not well 
 posted upon the subject are not aware how inefficient 
 the .Jersey railroads are to bring in the market gar- 
 den vegetables along the lines. The companies seem 
 to think that if they accommodate the passenger 
 business, it is all that is required of them. One of 
 the benefits to farmers is to mike known to them the 
 improvements of others. Look at another benefit — 
 the bringing together of the vast numl)ers of agri- 
 culturists at our annual fairs. JManj' people for the 
 U St time see things that they never bidore had 
 thought .f, and they go home with improvement so 
 stamped upon their minds that they cannot but pro- 
 gres.-i. In tact; we are almost entirely indebted to 
 railroads for the ability to hold these fairs. Tlies; 
 farmers are induced to meet from all parts of the 

country by the ease with which they reach the spot 
 by railroads. It is incalculable how much these 
 meetings improve our farm produ.t'. Newer bet- 
 ter vegetab es are seen, which induces men to pro- 
 cure the same kind of seed, whereby the production 
 of a whole neighborhood,,after a few years, is increas- 
 ed. 

Talking of milk by railro.ad — what would this city 
 do for milk without that which comes by them, and 
 which could not be obtained in any other way. _ I 
 saw yesterday morning, when the Erie railroad milk 
 train arrivedat Jersey City, several large oars full of 
 milk cans. I was pleased with the remark of Mr. 
 Robinson about the cattle by railroad, and that fresh 
 beef could he brought a thousand miles perfectly 
 fresh in winter, thus leaving all the oft'al where it is 
 wanted to fertilize the land. Fertilizers, too, are con- 
 veyed by cars to places where they are much needed, 
 but would not pay for cartixge. Thus production is 
 increased. Where could you find room in this for 
 all the wagons that would be re(iuired to bring the 
 produce necessary for daily consumption. 

I see by the report in "The Tribune" this morning 
 that 22,000 animals for slaughter arrived, last week. 
 Mr. Robinson states that most of them came by rail- 
 road. 

The peaches carried last Summer by the Camden 
 and Amboy road, at eight cents a basket freight 
 amountBil to $1,400 a day. 

Thbi^increased use and benefits of railroads, is in- 
 creasing every day. 

Sugar of Milk for Invalids. 

A short time ago. Dr. Turnbull, of Liverpool, read 
 to the Literary and Philosophical Society a p iper on 
 the use of sugar of milk as an article of food in con- 
 sumption and other pulmonary diseases. It now ap- 
 pears that whey is coming into extensive use in Ger- 
 many, in the treatment not only of consumption, 
 but also of gout and rheuraaiism, and that some 
 German physicians entertain opinions as to the benfe- 
 fioial properties of sugar ol milk, (the ingreiliont to 
 which whey owes its virtues) similar to those late- 
 ly put forth by Dr. Turnbull. In the cheese dairies 
 of this country the whey is frequently given to pigs, 
 or otherwise wa-ted, and the lactine.nr sugar of milk, 
 now met with in commerce, is brought entirely from 
 Europe, b-iing prepared chiefly in Switzerland. Its 
 present high price is, however, a great obstacle to its 
 general use as a dieteti.3 remedy; but it is most desi- 
 rable that so valuable an article of food should no 
 hmger be wasteil, and that therefore the attention of 
 those engageil in making cheese should be directed 
 to the manufacture of this other product from milk, 
 which must sooner or later become an important ar- 
 ticle of food and of commerce. 

Wool. 

The Wool crop of Mercer county. Pa., for the pres- 
 ent year, is estimated at 200,000 lbs.; which at the 
 prices which have been obtained, will bo worth about 
 *!"J0,0OO. 

Price of wool have varied from forty-two to forty- 
 eight cents, averaging forty-five cents. 

Never, keep animals on a short allowance — if you 
 starve them they will surely starve you.
