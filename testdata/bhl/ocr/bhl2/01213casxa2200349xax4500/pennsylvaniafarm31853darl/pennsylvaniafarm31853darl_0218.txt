 Mr. Editor: — 

It ia of little use for man to reason 
 in regard to natural objects, unless his miud has 
 first become fairly matured, and has attained to 
 the conclusion, (the most' evident of ' all things,) 
 that the Diity has prescribed a supreme and immu- 
 table law, beyond the contines of which there can 
 never be any divergence. It is this eternal law which 
 renders palpable and positive to our senses, the now 
 unveiled facts of Geology, whose eternal impress of 
 countless ages, bids the mind to scorn and contemn 
 all the contradictory averments of frail man. The 
 Deity, when placing man upon the earth, exercising 
 both love and justice, generated within him an uner- 
 ring guide, whenever he should call into exercise its 
 unprejudiced perceptive and reflective powers. 

The study and contemplation of the vegetable 
 kingdom, with an ardent devotion for fifty years, have 
 matured the conviction of my mind, that the Creator 
 has been equally miudful of the humblest plant, and 
 of the microscopic insect, as of the mightiest devel- 
 opements of his power; and in the pursuit of this 
 and other studies, I have realized the fact, that alf 
 nature is replete with order, wisdom, harmony, and 
 love. 

Any question, therefore, inculcating a derangement 
 of this supreme order and harmony, has already re- 
 ceived its solution in my mind. In referring to the 
 supreme law, it has been most eloquently remarked, 
 by an American orator, that if gravitation were sus- 
 pended but for a single moment, all nature would sink 
 into chaos; and it may with equal truth be asserted, 
 that if the eternal law of sexuality were susceptible 
 of variation, there would be.no end to the confusion 
 of the races of animals and plants, and all creation 
 would become a heterogenous and disorganized mass. 
 And although the test of "long experience" is scoff- 
 ed at by Ml-. Meehan, I may still deem it worth some- 
 thing, when all my intelligent friends have arrived at 
 the same conclusions as myself. 

In penning my previous communications, 1 am not 
 aware that I have used any unbecoming language, 
 but I must plead guilty to somewhat impatient feel- 
 ings, when I see a man professing to impart infor- 
 mation to others, commence his operations with a 
 palpable blunder, one equally inexcusable, whether 
 from error or ignorance, and then attempting to 
 palm upon tho community through the medium of an 
 intelligent Society, the erroneous results of his blun- 
 der as positive facts, arraigning the systematic har- 
 mony of nature; although happily the discernment 
 of the Philadelphia Society passed over the subject 
 without notice. Mr. M. should also be aware, that 
 there are some statements and assertions, which 
 are too weak and contemptible to admit of serious ar- 
 gument. 

I will now pro-:;eed to discuss the points advanced 
 by Mr. Meehan and by W. D. on the Strawberry 
 Question, the former of which are evidently based in 
 error, and in a confusion of both facts and ideas, 
 whilst the latter has erred from misconception, and 
 a consequent misapplication; and I respond thereto, 
 notwithstanding I have just received a letter from 
 the oldest and most distinguished Pomological Editor 
 in the Union, (dated Boston,) urging me to drop the 
 discussion as useles.s, since it so evidently originated 
 through Mr. Meeban'a erroneous Selection of two 
 mixed varieties in his experiments'. 

You will perceive that this same position was ta" 
 ken by me at the commencement, and also by Mr. 
 Longworth, viz: that Mr. M. had begun with a blun- 
 der in the plants, the same as Mr. Downing had for- 
 merly done, and like the latter, he had not candor 
 enough to acknowledge his error. I trust, howeven 
 that Mr. M. will revise his op oration by a new tria' 
 with genuine plants, and in such a way that there 
 may be no room lor mista ke, or doubt, and all I ask 
 of any other person is, that he will make the test for 
 himself. Surel y if Mr. M. ever did accomplish what 
 he says he , did — that is , change pisHllates to stanii- 
 nates, it can be done again, for wisdom did not be- 
 come extinct witth his first experiment. And this last 
 j remark sHQtai most amply verified by the disclosure 
 I of his manifest ignorance when attempting to describe 
 what Ilovey's Seedling really is, and his acknowledge- 
 ment that 'one of his finest beds of Ilovey's Seedling,'- 
 (so called by him,) was declared by others to be 
 Buist's Pri^e, or some other her ma,phrodite variety; 
 when the former is most strongly marked, and the 
 best known of all strawberries, and any child ought 
 to readily distinguish the latter by its double height, 
 long petioles and peduncles, distinct ioliage, and 
 numerous flowers, to say nothing of its diiferently 
 formed fruit and sexuality. And in his communi. 
 cation in the Horticulturist, he further acknowledges 
 having planted for Ilovey's Seedling a bed of Burr's 
 New Pine, two years ago, which was about the peri- 
 od when the blundering comm enced; and yet he has 
 the assurance to ask of us now to believe in his im- 
 mu table accuracy. The strongest argument of all, 
 is his acknowledged mistakes, showing his plants 
 and his ideas to be equally confused. 

In regard to one of MoAvo y's strawberries referred 
 to, as having staminate and pistilla te flowers on the 
 same plant, such is the case with a stapjinate seed- 
 ling that has come mixed in with some parcels of 
 McAvoy's Extra Red, a'ld also with at least a dozen 
 other varieties; .and forms one of the phases of the 
 hermaphrodite class, among which are the Duke of 
 Kent's Scarlet, Eberlein, Triumph and others. The 
 flowers of the two sexes are sometimes on the same 
 scape, and sometimes on distinct scapes. 

It seems that Mr. M. and W. D. not being aware 
 that part of tho hermaphrodite family possess this
