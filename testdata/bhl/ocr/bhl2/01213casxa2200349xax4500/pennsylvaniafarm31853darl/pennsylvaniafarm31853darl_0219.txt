character, came to the conclusion that the plant they 
 saw was an anomaly or sportive variatiop; whereas, 
 that peculiar character is as permanent and invaria- 
 able as the other classes. 

I have letters just received from Mr. Longworth 
 and Mt McAvoy, confirming my views as to the in- 
 variable sexual character of the true Extra Red, and 
 referring also to the spurious seedling I have named. 
 And as to. the mention made by Mr. M., that Mr. 
 Longworth stated to him iu regard to the Extra lied, 
 "that it is the first instance that has come binder hi^ 
 ci6se/-«a<io« of pistillatci kinds producing hermaphro- 
 dite flowers." Mr. Longworth says in a letter to me, 
 of the 8th inst., that no, such fact has come under 
 his observation at all. And such is the response of 
 the gentleman whom Mr. M. qu(>tes as having "rais- 
 ed that variety in his own garden, and under his 
 own acute observation." Mr. McAvoy goes a little 
 further, and after the most positive denial of any 
 sexual variation, says, 1 will give $50 to Mr. Mee- 
 h:in, or any other person, who will change it to a 
 stamiuato , and I think I know a person who will 
 give a great deal more, but I would select the jtlanU 
 mi/sclj." 

To settle the question of apparent "evasion," I 
 will refer at once to the point in dispute. Iir the 
 first place, Mr. M. stated he had chauc/cd pistUlates 
 to slaminatcs or perfect Jlowers, by special culture as 
 there stated. Now if flowers do thus change and 
 bauomj perfect, they will of course, produce fruit, 
 thit result b3in^ the only decisive test that they are 
 perfect; and such w.\3 doubtless his meaning and ac_ 
 tu.ll balief, wheu ho m vie his first communication, 
 as will be evident by referring thereto, wherein he 
 asserts, "the distinction between staminates and pis- 
 tillates to be worthless, cultivation producing either 
 the one or the other." 

But in his second communication (June,) he still 
 adheres to the sams opinion as to the transmutation 
 of sexis, bat ab.inljn3 what he at first declared to 
 ba the cause, and says "he may be in error in his 
 opinion that the change from one sex to another, was 
 the result of cultiv.i.ion." I rcspauded, denying his 
 promises and his alleged facts. And ho having at 
 last discovered that pistillates grown separately will 
 not produce fruit, backs out entirely from his other 
 position, and when I offered as a d.'cisive test a large 
 premluui for "one perfect berry from Ilovey's Seed- 
 ling grown by itself," he remarks, "Who said they 
 cmld do aay thiiit) of the kind^ Was there over 
 greater subterfuge and evasion ? I answer that he 
 himself said so, and meant so, in his original com- 
 munication; for if he did not mean that, what did he 
 mean, or did he mcau nothing at all? 

I ask then, if this query of his does not amount to 
 » complete recantation, and an admission of the 
 truth of my entire position? I don't much like tliis 
 ■slipping out by degrees and by stealth, but if Mr. M. 

will back square out, I shall be satisfied, for the pub- 
 lic will then know what to believe. 

Mr. M. attempts some cavil in regard to Mr. Down- 
 ing's having committed a similar blunder to himself, 
 but the facts are too transparent to be misunder- 
 stood. It is niot true as Mr. M. asserts, that "Mr. 
 D.'s observations led him to the conclusion that IIo- 
 vfey's strawberry would by culture, become a her- 
 maphrodite," for he had never possessed Ilovey's 
 S°edling when he made his erroneous statement. 
 I well remember the circumstance, for immediately 
 after his article appeared, I jumped on board a steam- 
 er and visited his grounds, and asked to see the bed 
 of Ilovey's Seedling, when, to my amazement, I was 
 shjwn a very tall growing variety, with narrow ob- 
 long pointed leaflets, of a pale green color, long 
 scapes, large and numerous flowers, and totally dis- 
 tinct from Hoveys in these and all other points as 
 possible. 

I was astounded at such a solution of the mysto 
 ry, but said nothing. I obtained a few plants from 
 that identical bed, which I brought home, and plant- 
 ed, and tested to my satisfaction. Immediately on 
 my return, I announced to Mr. Huntsman and some 
 others, tho fact, and we had a most hearty lau"-h 
 over this mouse from the mountain, and shortly after 
 came forth the same miraculous disclosure by the 
 Boston Horticultural Society. The further assertion 
 by Mr. M., that this Society "decided that the kind 
 was not ilovey's because it was a staminate," is also 
 untrue. They decided that it was not Ilovey's, be 
 cause it bad no one character in foliage, flower or 
 fruit, or bearing any similitude to Ilovey's. Any 
 Yankee child escaped from its cradle, would have 
 come to the same conclusion. Mr. Downini" was tjo 
 shrewd not to feel the efl'ect-of so gross an error, and 
 although, as Mr. Longworth says, he never publicly 
 corrected it, as was his duty, Ije nevertheles gave the 
 moat complete proof of his own conviction, by care- 
 fully abstaining from any ro-.assertion of his errone- 
 ous position to the time of hisj death, and always 
 seemed very desirous to keep shad;/ on this point. I 
 regret that Mr. M. should deny to him the exorciso 
 of ordinary shrewdnfiss, by stating that Mr. Down- 
 ing could never be made to understand the blunder. 

Mr. M. refers alsi to a wager, but I have offered 
 none. I did oft'ur to pay a certain sum to any one, 
 to do what he had declared he had done with ease, 
 but wiXhout any possible gain to myself. Mr. M. 
 should consult a dictionary, and correct his defi- 
 nition, for even poetry becomes foolery when it has 
 no application. Mr. Longworth made an offer for a 
 hermaphrodite produced by cultivation from a pis- 
 tillate plant. I made an offer for "one perfect berry 
 from Ilovey's Seeding grown by itself." Now as all 
 hermaphrodites produce fruit, the result would bo 
 identically the same, and as Mr. M. can so easily 
 change pistillates to staminates, "b>j beinj forced »low-
