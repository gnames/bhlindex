ly ill a moderate temperalure," he ought to set about 
 it at once, and obtain the reward. 

In regard to the communication from W. D , it 
 seems very apparent that he has not talieu into con- 
 sideration the fact that the distinctive variations of 
 the strawberry, as staminate, hermaphrodite, and 
 pistillate, constitute the normal coiidilioiis of the 
 the plant, and that consequently any change of the 
 primitive character would be a transmutation of the 
 identical description which he so forcibly rejects, and 
 whose impracticability he has so lucidly expounded. 

It can, therefore, bear no affinity to his quoted in- 
 stance of vai'latioa in the "floral organs," arising 
 from luxuriant culture, and their cja^ejaint smoept- 
 ibility to further change. 

Large and luxuriant foliage, when resulting from 
 excited vigor, are precisely in accordance with an in- 
 crease in the size or plurality of the petals, and this 
 increase often renders flowers so double as to usurp 
 the position of the sexual organs, and thereby pre- 
 vents the production of seeds, but w'ithout in any 
 way aSFacting their sexuality. As well might the 
 develop3m3ut of fatness on a well-fed animal be con- 
 founded with a change of his sex. 

And whilst on this subject, I would ask of W. D., 
 in hi;? discussion of the sportive results of Culture, 
 which are applicable to so many plants, to designate 
 a single instance where it has resulted in a chauge 
 of sex. 

In regard to this question of sexuali.y, the straw- 
 berry is the very last plant that should have been as- 
 sailed, for so disti'nct are the natural varieties, that 
 staminate and pistillate plants may be almost invari- 
 ably distinguished by simply comparing the number 
 of flowers on the scapes, and even by the size of a 
 single flower, without seeing any other part ,of the 
 plant. 

Mr. G. W. Huntsman can tell the sex of more 
 than fifty varieties of strawberries by the leaf alone. 

The sexual distinction in the scapes taken from 
 the same plant, to which \V. U. alludes, and wuich 
 I have explained, in a previous paragraph, might 
 well strike a casual observer as an anomaly, when 
 not. apprized of its constitutional character, but it 
 could present ho excuse to one who has been long 
 pursuing the strawberry culture. And W. D. is great- 
 ly mistaken when he says, "It is this kind of o ange 
 in tlie character of the flowers which I understand 
 Mr. Meehan to aiuiounce as having occurred in 
 plants under his management." Mr. M. says no 
 such thing, but distinctly states that liis pistillales. 
 chaiijsd to .■itaiaiiiales or perfect flowers, and in fact he 
 had no knowledge when he wrote his lirst article, 
 that any variety pjssessed the characteristics of the 
 new seedling from McAvoy, but in May, when he 
 first saw its bloom, he seized upon what he deemed a 
 God-send, hoping it might answer as a scape-goat to 
 sustain him in his en-uneous dilemma, and he imme- 

diately dispatched specimens to W. D., a highly ac- 
 complished botanist, but not specially advised as to 
 the varieties of the strawberry, for the purpose of 
 courting his aid, and thus ho misled I hat gentleman, 
 by being first duped himself, in a matter which he 
 ought to have been fully conversant with for a very 
 long period, as the Duke of Ivent's Scarlet, and oth- 
 ers possessing the same character, originated in his 
 own country, (England,) andare enumerated in the 
 London Horticultural Society's Catalogue of 1820, 
 and had been under culture there for many years 
 previous. 

It further appears that what Mr. M. speaks of 
 as, "tits able article of IT. D., which so clearly sets 
 forth his ideas," was in fact based on a mistaken 
 conclusion, from an inspection of the scapes of the 
 new strawberry from McAvoy, sent to W. D., by 
 Mr. M. in May, but which neither party had ever 
 seen a flower of at the time when Mr. M. penned hie 
 original communication, which was in the month of 
 March. Oh! tetnpoi a ! Oh ! Mores I 

It will therefore be seen, that this seeking shelter 
 under the wing of W. D. will not absolutely prove of 
 avail, and neither will the still more astounding cii- 
 .jumstanoe, that the argument^ and comments used 
 by W.. D., in the July number of the Farm Journal, 
 comprisiug points wliich Mr. M. had never thought 
 'of advancing, arc found embodied in an article from 
 Mr. Meehan himself, in the August number of the 
 Horticulturist, as oriyiiial and without any credit to 
 their author. 

In concluding my comments, I will simply state, 
 that I have cultivated all the important varieties of 
 the strawberry for a very long period, and durii gthe 
 last ten years with especial atteotion, and I have now 
 above one hundred and fifty varieties iu my grounds, 
 and yet, after the closest scrutiny by myself, and my 
 neighbor, Mr. Huntsman, we have never been able to 
 discover any sexual variation whatever. 

The real causes forthe discussions on this subject, 
 •have arisen from the rapidity with which runners 
 pass from one bed to another, and the frequency of 
 seedling plants springing up in beds diflenng from 
 those alieady growing therein. In fact you can 
 scarcely go into any garden without finding some ac- 
 cidental mixtures from these causes. 

As Mr. M., in his attempt to describe Ilovey's 
 Seedling, has shown his utter want of reliable dis. 
 crimination, I will define its immutable character. 
 Hjvey's Seedl ng is a plant of low growth, and very 
 distinct appe arance, remarkable for its large, round, 
 deep, .glossy, green, luxuriant foliage; the petioles 
 and peduncles short, the flowers of medium size and 
 not numerous, pistillate, with rudimental abortive 
 stamens, very productive, fruit too well known to 
 need description. 

Having now taken some paiils to enlighten Mr. 
 M. as to the real facts of the case under discussion,
