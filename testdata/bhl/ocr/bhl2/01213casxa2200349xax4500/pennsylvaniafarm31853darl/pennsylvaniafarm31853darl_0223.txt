 •OF SOME collections. — This is one oFour most beauti- 
 ful apnle.s, and from its flavor, and productiveness 
 S3 worthy of extensive cultivation. 

It was brought into notice by the late Judge Buel, 
 ■who described aod named it after Jonathan Has- 

bronck, from whom he first received the fruit. Its 
 at;ractivo appearance will always make it profitable 
 for market. It comes into bearing early, and is very 
 productive, The growth of the young wood is slen- 
 der, and of a light brown color, with large terminal 
 buds. 

Fruit of medium siie, regularly formed, roundish 
 ovate or tapering to the eye, skin smooth, the ground 
 clear light yellow, nearly covered by lively red 
 stripes, shaded with crimson or purplish red on the 
 sunny side; stem one inch long, rather slender, curv- 
 ed and deeply sunk in a regular cavity; calyx set in 
 a deep, rather broad basin; flesh white, sometimis 
 tinged with red, tender and juicy, -.vith a rich, spright- 
 ly sub-acid flavor. November to April. 

Fig. 2. Esopcs Spitzenburg. — This rich and high- 
 ly flavored fruit originated at Esopus, on the Hud- 
 son, a district rather celebrated for its superior 
 apples. It is ranked by many as equal to the New- 
 town Pippin, and as unsurpassed by any other vari- 
 ety Large orchards of it are growing in New York 
 State, and the continued popularity and great de- 
 mand for it in our Estern cities, with its uniformly 
 fair appearance, renders it one of the most profitable 
 for orchard culture. 

The tree is rather a slow grower, of upright habit 
 when young, with slender shoots, but having long
