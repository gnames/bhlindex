Cherry Festival. 

The foUow'.n^ aojiouat by Dr. Kennicott, taken from 
 the Horiiculturist, of the trial of Dr. Kirtland's now 
 seedling cherries, at Cleveland, Ohio, "was acciden- 
 tally omitted in our last number. The tost they 
 were submitted to, vras both just and severe, and 
 as they withstood the trial so well, the Dr. may 
 well be complimented for the very rare good fortuae, 
 unprecedented in this country, of originating so 
 lariT'c a number ol new and valuable seedlings. — 
 The forthcoming book on fruits, by F. R. Elliott, 
 will no doubt be posted up, with a minute and 
 furthrtr description. 

It is well known to the old readers of "The Horti- 
 culturist," that Dr. Kirtland has been long engaged 
 in testing seedling cherries from the old Yellow 
 Spanish, fertilized by Black Tartarian, American 
 Amber, May Duke, and Arch Djke, and, possibly, 
 other varieties; though these sorts grew beside the 
 tree of Yellow Spanish, that furnished the seeds of 
 these Kirtland Cherries, {which F. K. Elliott has oo- 
 casionly described,) and many others, not yet brought 
 into notice on account of the great reluctance of the 
 Doctor to permit a fruit, not fully equal to the best, 
 to get abroad before the produce of j'ears has given 
 repeated testimony in favor of the claims of the new 
 candidate lor notice. 

The way the Doctor managed with us showed both 
 sensitiveness and confidence. Mr. Elliott took us all 
 up to Rockport before showing us the Cherries of his 
 own planting; and there we found Dr. Kirtland, pre- 
 pared to get a candid opinion from every one, not 
 capable of determining the identity of a variety, 
 when placed alongside of others the most nearly ro- 
 sembling it. Some twenty or thirty dishes of Cher- 
 ries were arranged, designated by numbers alone; 
 and as the variety p.assed round, we were required 
 to enter the number, and wri.e down our opinions 
 against it; and at the conclusion of this exiuniriation, 
 a number was called and we read off' our remarks in 
 succession — no one being excused— and ikcn Dr. 
 Kirtland announced the name of the Cherry, and 
 gave its history; and though (as we knew) there 
 were some half dozen sorts of the best old Cherries 
 artfully arranged, so as to escape detection if possible 
 yet, in nearly every instance;, the Kiriland Siedlimjs 
 were lite ones selected as '-best!" And what must 
 have pleased the old Doc or better than this unbias- 
 ed testimony in favor of his Cherries, we all selected 
 as (he best those sorts which are most esteemed by 
 himselt' and F. R. Elliott. 

In my blind notes, Mammoth and Delicate arc set 
 down as the very best; but the majority rated, al)out 
 as follows: — Of the reds — (Jov. Wood, Delicate, Kirt- 
 land's Mary, and Rockport ISigarrcau; Relic d'Choisy 
 being ranked as "best" in one instance onl3'. Of the 
 blacks — Black Hawk and Osceola were entirely a- 
 head of an;/ of the old blacks. The Doctor, and Lo- 
 gan, ;in.l afso Jockusott, are down on my list; the 
 "Doctor" is a very sweet Cherry, and all the blacks 
 are, in some way, supin-ior; but unfonuiiately, very 
 few ol them were ripe; and so some of the reds. -Vnd, 
 by the w.iy, there are some forty varieties in all; not 
 one of wh ch but is more worthy of cultivation than 
 a large portion of the Old world varieties. 

And now, for the great p lint of wirth, and the 
 wonder of all — except my first favoiite.tlie mammoth, 
 which is a poor bearer, and possilily two or three oth- 
 ers, not yet before the public — all of these thirty or 
 forty seedlings are the most prulilic of Cherries, beat- 
 ing the old sorts ouc of all comparison, in many in- 
 stances, and beating them sufficiently in every case. 
 The limbs were literally massed with fruit — and siic/i 
 fruit ! Oh ! j'ou sliuiild have been there, friend Bar- 
 ry, for — although you arc not in the habit of going 
 off in ecsiacies over every new thing — you are capa- 
 ble of appreciating e.^cellenco, and giving others just 
 and sensible notions of the worthies of the day — a- 
 mong which I am inclined to rank the Kirtland Cher- 
 ries pretty near the head of the list in Pomology. I 
 feel grateful to friend Elliot for the chance of seeing 
 and eating to repletion, these delicious productions of 
 the West, and I assure him — as I now do you — that 
 should his forthcoming book not go beyond the Clter- 
 ries, even, it can not fail of interesting pomologists, 
 the Union over. 

Analysis of Soils. 

Every observing farmer is aware, that there is a 
 great difference in the agricultural value of soils, 
 both as regards the ease with which tbey can be cul- 
 tivated, and' their natural capacity for grow ng good 
 crops of corn, grain and grasses. This fact is much 
 more observable in the hilly, rocky regions of New 
 England, than in some other sections of our country. 
 There are immense tracts of land in some of the 
 AVestern States, that vary but little in their agricul- 
 tural value, as far as their ability to produce such 
 crops are concerned. So alike are these soils in their 
 physical condition, mineral and organic composition, 
 and mechanical texture, that fields of thousands a-f 
 acres scarcely exhibit any diifercncc in the evenness 
 and quality of the corn, or other crops growing up- 
 on these extensive fields, when under the same course 
 of cultivation. Such are the soils of the Miami 
 and Scioto bottom lands of Ohio. In 1851, it was 
 stated in the Cincinnad Gazette, "that on the Great 
 Miami Bottom, about 2-5 -miles below Cincinnati, 
 there was one field (belonging to several owners) sev- 
 en miles long by three miles broad, whicli had beea 
 regularly planted to corn for nearly half a century. 
 In the Wabash Valley there were also extensive 
 corn-fields; — one between Terro Haute and Lafay- 
 ette, being ten miles long." 

From the great and long conlinued fertility of the 
 soil of the Scioto Valley, it has generally been sup- 
 posed that that soil is vastly rither in tlie inorganic 
 basis of a fertile soil, viz:, potash,, soda, liine, lbs 
 phosphates, &;:., than tiie soils of Massachusetts. and 
 New Hampshire. 

Ex-Cov. Trimljle, of 0!iio, President of the Slate 
 Board of Agriculture, says in the first annual Re- 
 port, (1840) "that one hundred and fifty Jjushels of 
 corn have been gathered from an acre, out of a field 
 of one hundred acres, each acre of wlilcli wa,-* esti- 
 mated to produce an equal number of bushels. This 
 was a I extrtiordinary crop, iuid was the result, na 
 doubt, of oxtraordituiry culture; hut the fact thut 
 some of the bottoms on the Scioto have been culliv.i- 
 ted forty-five years in corn witlmut rotation or reit, 
 and tliat they ctmtinue to proiluee from tifly to sevofi- 
 ty-tivc busiiels to the acre is conclusive ovideneo of 
 their great fertility ^ind darahility." . 

Tiic hott'im lands of Ohio are, probably, in some 
 respects different from tho prairie i«oilsof Illinois. 
 Fr -m the light and friable nature o! the prairi.- soii.^, 
 they oiTcr so little resistance to the plow and olhor
