Atkins' Aiitomatou, or Self-Raking Reaper and 
 Mower. 

The above engraving wo have procured with a 
 view of giving our readers some idea of tliis cele- 
 brated reaper, having the peculiarity above all others, 
 of an ingenious attachment, which, without adding 
 much to the labor of the team, takes up the wheat 
 on the platform, as fast as it accumulates enough for 
 a bundle, and deposits it ready for binding, on one 
 side of the swath, more perfectly than it can be done 
 by hand. 

J. J. Thomas, who witnessed its trial at Geneva, 
 N. Y., s.ays of it — "At the same time, the self-raker 
 presented by J. S. Wright, of Chicago, was tiied — it 
 was truly an extraordinary curiosity, and excited the 
 highest interest. The self-raking machine (attached 
 to Ilussey's Reaper,) is the invention of J. Atkins, 
 of Cliieago, a person of great ingenuity, as this con- 
 trivance fully testifies. The rake sweeps the bed 
 where the fallen grain is deposited, presses it against 
 a toothed plate, and both, holding firmly the bundle 
 of grain tlius collected, swing round the quarter of a 
 circle off behind, when they open wide, and drop 
 their contents in a neat bunch upon the ground. All 
 these motions are accomplished by a very simple 
 piece of mechanism, and they seem so neaidy the im- 
 mediate result of intelligence, that this machine was 
 generally called by the name of the "Automaton 
 Reaper." 

Its invention is quite recent, and it had scarcely 
 ever been used bo{ore,and hence owing to an accident 
 it did not succeed the first day of its trial. It wa.<, 
 however, repaired, a temporary roe' attached, and 
 tried again on the 23d with entire satisf^iction, prov- 
 ing decidedly the best self-raker on the ground. 

The origin of this invention is quite interesting, 
 and is related as follows: 

The inventor is Mr. Jearum Atkins, late of Will 
 county, Illinois, now residing at Chicago. lie is a 
 millwright by trade, and as this invention testifies, 
 an original and remarkable mechanical genius. A. 

bout ten years ago he had the misfortune to be injur- 
 ed by a fall, and he has since been almost wholly 
 confined to his bed, being unable even to sit up more 
 than two or three minutes at a time. 

Two or three years ago, a reaper was brought in- 
 to this neighborhood, and an opportunity given him 
 to examine it from his bed for a few minutes. A 
 farmer present, knowing his inventive skill, remarked 
 to him, 'that if he "would only itttach a raker to it, 
 he would make his fortune." Being a son of pover- 
 ty as well as affliction, compelled to rely wholly upon 
 his friends for support, they themselves being also 
 poor, yet possessed of a manly, independent spirit, 
 the remark awakened his thought and determina- 
 tion. Various plaps were successively formed and 
 abandoned without trial, farther than a small model, 
 till last Winter he struck upon a wholly new arrange- 
 ment. Having mentally studied out the details, he 
 ascertained by mathematical calculation, before ma- 
 king any part of his model, the sis^e, movement, and 
 effect of each separate piece, and then made one 
 part after another of his model, according to his 
 figures, put the separate pieces together, and the 
 whole movement was ofFeotod exactly as calculated, 
 even to a little rise in the rako as it is drawn across 
 the platform. The model has not been altered, and 
 the full sized machine is almost precisely the model 
 enlarged. 

Considering the novel and complicated motions, 
 yet perfect simplicity and small number of pieces by 
 which they are produced, is shows a very high order 
 of mechanical talent to have at once perfected such 
 a machine, and in such a manner. Most inventors, 
 it is believed, get sonic parts to work right in a mod- 
 el, and then plan and add another and another, but- 
 the whole plan of this Self-Raker was entirely form- 
 ed in the inventor's mind before a single piece of 
 wood or metal for his model was touched. 

Seldom is it that an invention, involving any thing 
 like the novelty and complicated movement of this, is 
 at once and so successfully introduced into practical
