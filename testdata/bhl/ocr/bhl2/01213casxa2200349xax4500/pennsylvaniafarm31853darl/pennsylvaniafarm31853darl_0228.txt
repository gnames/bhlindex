KETCIIUMS MOWING MACHINE. 

[October 

ose, even when the inventor has the benefit of much 
 experience in the branch of industry for which he is 
 laboring; yet eo thoroughly had Jlr. Atkins studiad 
 out all the difficulties to be obviated, that though he 
 had never seen a reaper but once, and then not at 
 work, — notwithstanding he knew nothing of grain 
 catting, having from boyhood been closely devoted 
 to his trade till he became bed-ridden; still, so correct 
 were his views, that where the machanics deviated 
 from his plans in constructing the machine for trial, 
 it filled, and his wishes had to lie followed out in 
 every particular. 

Eight first premiums were awarded to Atkins' 
 -Reaper in 1352. It is warranted to be a good Self- 
 Raking R.'aper, though not warranted as a Mower, 
 yet every experiment in grass has been successful.

Ketchum's Mowing- Machine. 

Among the many different mowing machines which 
 have been tested the past Summer, in this section of 
 tho Union, we have heard of none giving such gener- 
 al satisfaction ^s Ketchum's. Wjb have, no interest in 
 one more than'an other, and only wish to keep our 
 readers advised of the claims and recommendations 
 of each, to enable them to judge for themselves 
 which is the best. As we anticipate a largely increas- 
 ed di'inand by another year, it is important that the 
 peculiarities of each' should be- well understood, as 
 well as the result of any trial exJiibitions. 

We hope to be able to furnish a cut and descrip- 
 tion of each now patented, in the Pennsylvania Farm 
 Journal, before another season. Howard & Co., the 
 manulaeturers at Builiilo.of Ketchum's state that they 
 have sold more than 1000 the present season, under 
 the following warrantee: 

"That said machines are capable of cutting and 
 spreading with one span of horses and driver, from 
 t-an to fifteen acres per day. of a»iy kind of grass, 
 heavy or U'jhi, wd or dri/, Indijed or slanding; and do 
 it as well as is done with a scythe by the best 
 mowers." 

The recent improvements are: 

First, Every Shaft has bearings at both ends, which 
 entirely overcom-is all crainjyiiig, and catling aioay 
 of boxing. 

Second, The simplicity and strength of the entire 
 gear, as well as the great con\cnienco and ease in 
 getting at each and every nut about the machine; al- 

so the very convenient arrangement by which every 
 piece and part of the machine may be got at or ta- 
 ken apart. 

Third, A counter balance attached to the crank 
 shaft which gives the crank a steady and uniform 
 motion, as well as causes the machine to run much 
 easier than any before built. 

Fourth, Every machine will be made to throw out 
 of gear. 

Fifth, The convenience of oiling, every bearing 
 having an oil cup sufficient to hold. oil for a long time, 
 by stuffing the same with cotton. 

"Instrutcions poa Use. — Put the knife bar to its 
 place, and be sure all the nuts are tight; oil the ma- 
 chine well, except the knives: the brass boxes should 
 bo stric ly looked to, and not confined so much as to 
 cause friction — also, particular care should be ob- 
 served to keep them well oiled; guage the machine by 
 the neck yoke strop, the front of knife bar wanting 
 to be a little higher than on a level; in very heavy or 
 lodged grass, attach the track clearer at the outer 
 end of the rack bar; in starting, alwaj s give the 
 knives a motion before coming into tlie grass; the 
 driver should always be on his seat, and drive with 
 a steady brisk walk, and in no case turn (O' the left; 
 to shai-pen the knives, disconnect the pitman and 
 draw them out through the main wheel; in grinding 
 them, be careful and keep the same bevel; the usual 
 quantity to cut without sharpening, is from five to 
 ten acres. 

If the above directions are followed, we warrant ■ 
 the machine to work as recommended.

Ketchum's mower took the first premium at the 
 mowing exhibition at Mount Holly, NewJersey, and 
 Montgomery county. Pa., f i r the best mower, also at 
 the trial in Springfield, Ohio, and received a gold 
 medal at the American Institute in New York, and 
 perhaps others of which we are not advised. 

Manure for Autumn ligses. 
 Mr. Rives, a famous Rose Culturist, applies a mix- 
 ture of wood-ashes and guano in the proportion of 
 half a peck of guano to a bushel of ashes to his late 
 roses, with most excellent efifect. About two quarts 
 of the mixture is applied to each shrub or tree, in a 
 circle eighteen inches in diameter around the stem, 
 where it is suft'ered to remain undisturbed until Au- 
 tumn. It should lie applied early in June and cov- 
 ered with a thin grass mulch, and the effect will be 
 that it will i-otain the dew and shower, and keep the 
 tree in constant and vigorous growth, which very 
 necessary to the production of a good crop of flowers 
 in the Fall.
