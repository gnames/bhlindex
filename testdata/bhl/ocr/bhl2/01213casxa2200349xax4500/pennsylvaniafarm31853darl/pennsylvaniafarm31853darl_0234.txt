 The Potatoe Plant. 

J. Lacv Darlington, 

Dear Sir: — We promised your 
 readers of the September No. the best mode of pre- 
 venting the potatoe disease, as well as the praetical 
 view.s and experiments, of Dr. Klotzsch ir, relation 
 to quantity and quality. Our German authors be- 
 lieve, that the new potatoe is formed along the oours6 
 of new stalks or runners, so that each new tuber be- 
 comes as it were a centre for the spreading of roots, 
 and any agent or agents that suppress the spreading 
 of roots and tlie formation of new potatoes, will also 
 impede the growths of the stalli ; and in return what; 
 over primarily affects tlie stalks, will have secondarily 
 bad effects, on the growth of the potatoe. 

In raising potatoes, we should therefore have three 
 great objects in view: 

1st. Encouragement of stalks and leaves. 

2d. Adaptation of soil and depth of planting. 

3d. Locality. 

In carrying out our first object, Dr. Klotzsch made 
 experiments as early as 1846, on single potatoe plants. 
 He pinched off the ends of the branches or stalks 
 half an inch the 6th or 7th week after planting, or 
 when the stalks reached the heighth of from six to 
 nine inches above the soil. Great stress is laid on 
 not taking off more than is above specified peradven- 
 ture it might stunt the grow.th of the plant. This 
 treatment is repeated on the hranches, after they 
 have attained the same length ; by these manifesta- 
 tions, simple as they are, easy as they are perform- 
 ed, it was ascertained that the stalks were, more nu- 
 merous, containing many more leaves, and could well 
 bo distinguished from all the others, which were left 
 to mother nature. The produce from these plants 
 were abundant, and the potatoes perfectly healthy, 
 while the plant next them which had not been so 
 treated, gave unilbrmily less produce, and in many 
 instances attacked with the disease. In order to ver- 
 ify and substantiate this experiment, he tried the 
 game for several years successively with ihe same un- 
 surpassing results. He had a field fertilized, culti- 
 vated and planted, with the same, all in all, and af- 
 ter they attained the height above described he 
 pinched off the points of the stalks of every second 
 row, repeating it in due season, once more on the 
 branches. In the end of August the rows which had 
 been thus treated were luxuriant arid "in full vigour, 
 whilst those left to nature wire fast decuying and 
 partly dead. It was an object of amusement to him 
 whilst it excited wonder and astonishment amongst 
 his neighbors. The season of digging arrived, and 
 not unlike his first experiment the yield was vastly 
 greater than the rows not so treated, and Avithout 
 disease; whereas the disease had made its appear- 
 ance again to a vast extent in the rows left to nature. 
 The expenses in Germany to have the manipula- 

tion above recommended performed, are about twen- 
 ty-five cents per acre, and with due caution is per- 
 formed by women and children. 

The principle of Dr. Klotzsch's experiments is very 
 simple, and as already said, on the ground that when 
 the stalks are rank the roots will be so likewise ; he 
 believes secondly, that the stalks by the above opera- 
 tion keep the surface moist, and consequently pre- 
 vent that parching heat of the surface which after a 
 shower of rain causes the Jirebiasf. He believes 
 thirdly, that if the potato plant if left to nature, 
 with but a single or perhaps two stalks to a germ, if 
 even rank, yet as is well known with few leaves are 
 not sufficient to keep up that endosmatic and exos- 
 matic process tm which in fact the well being of our 
 plant depends. 

It is indeed worthy the attention of Farmers, and 
 all we hope — who may read the views of our au- 
 thors, will try it next season. 

We will discuss the other points altove laid down 
 in our next. E. K. Beavek.

P. S. — The mysteries of our assertions in regard 
 to the fly in wheat, has startled your correspondent 
 J. B. Garber, Esq., he says: "How could the ova 
 or egg remain dormant all fall and winter, and then 
 about the 20th of .May crawl up the stem to the sec- 
 ond joint." Answering it himself, he infers that 
 "an insect in the ova state evidently has no means of 
 locomotion." We fully agree with Mr. G. as to the 
 locomotion apparatus of the ova, and therefore no 
 crawling up the stem to the second joint, yet we 
 would respectfully suggest, that our ova tribes in gen- 
 eral travel ■without legs according to Harvey and oth- 
 er Animalculists, and that in this instance the ova 
 occupies this place at an earlier date than above said, 
 and as for the necessity of being deposited by its 
 parent mhcvecer found, is somewhat different from the 
 ordinary opinions of researchers ; we would in con- 
 clusion refer him to the article written by "E." of 
 Chester county.

In compliance with your request, when in your 
 pleasant little boroughj a short time since, I send you 
 a few lines upon the subject to which your paper has 
 been devoted, and in which you have my most ear- 
 nest wishes that you may be successful. 

The part of community most benefited by agricul- 
 tural journals, havfe been very much at fault hereto- 
 fore, for their almost total neglect of agricultural 
 paners, and have looked with ridicule and contempt 
 upon articles written upon this subject. But the 
 times are changing; men are beginning to learn that
