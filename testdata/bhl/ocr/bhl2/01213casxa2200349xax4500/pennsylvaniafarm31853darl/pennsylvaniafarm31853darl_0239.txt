Prize Essay ou i'igs. 

We commence In present number, a prize essay on 
 the Breeding and management of Pigs, by Thomas 
 Rovvlandson, extracted from the Journal of the Royal 
 Agricultural Society of Engbmd. It embraces the 
 whole subject, from the Natural History and Anato 
 my of the pig, the various breels and crosses, their 
 respective meriis for conversion into frpsh meat, 
 pickled pork, bacon, ham and mode of preparing or 
 curing the same, the best and most economical mode 
 of rearing, keeping and fattening, construction of 
 sties, with the theory of action of v.arious articles of 
 food, &c. 

The essay will be found no less important to the 
 American Farmer, and intjresting, than the two 
 which have preceded it in the Farm Journal from 

the same source. AVe consider all of them highly 
 valuable for preservation and future reference. 

Though there are some matters in each, not ex- 
 pressly adapted to our country, and even in which 
 we have improved in the practice of our cousins a- 
 cross the water, yet there is much minute calcula- 
 tion and experiment, much close and extensive ob- 
 servation, from which the practical farmer here, iray 
 deduce important facts, big ly useful in his own 
 management. 

The an. pie means at the disposal of the Royal Ag. 
 ricultural Society, enable them to offer liberal re- 
 wards, for these prize essays, which thus enlists 
 some of the best talent of the Kingdom. They ap- 
 pear at stated intervals and embrace a wide range.

By naturalists the hog is placed in the class Mam- 
 malia, order Pachydermata, and genus SuidaB and 
 Sus; to this order belongs the elephant the rilinoceros, 
 the hippotamus, &c.; all the species feed on plants, 
 and several upon roots, while some M the number, 
 the ho" to wit, will, in addition, devour animal sub- 
 stances. The order is thick-skinned, <'xccpdiij_gly acute 
 in the olfactory and oral senses, voracious, and de- 
 lights in moist and warm shady places. Obtuseiie.«s 
 of intellect is generally attributed to the family — poss- 
 ibly unjustly, seeing that the half reasoning elephant 
 belongs to its ranks: and with respect to the genus 
 under notice, it is difficult to say how far its obtuse- 
 ness is attributable to neglect and maltreatment: 
 naturally the hog is social, ami evinces great sym- 
 ]]athy tor th« ailments of its eompiitiioni — has been 
 known to display an unvarying and warm attachment 
 to particular individuals. The acutc^noss of its olfac- 
 tory organs has been made subservient to the uses of 
 man by the truflu-hunter. This faculty has also been 
 made use of in setting game in the two well-known 
 instances of Colonel Thornton ami the sow brnken- 
 in by Mr. Toamer, game-keeper of Sir II. P. St. 
 Jiihn Mildmay. In both instances it was remarked 
 that tlie suent of the game was noticed by the pig 
 when it had been passed over by the best pointers.
