The bliiok variety varies little in appearance from the 
 Neapolitan, the distinctive characteristics beinj; the 
 shorter and thicker leg and much wider snout of the 
 Chinese: their form is a round body, slKjrt head, wide 
 cheek, high chin, exceedingly thick skin, covered 
 with tine biistles; it has not a very fine shape, and 
 when fat appears to have no neck, and little more 
 than the tips of the snout can be seen; it is a very 
 gross feeder, eating almost any thing, and if the food 
 given be of an animal and fatty nature the skin will 
 frequently burst in patches, and form scabs on the 
 alnima.'s back, which it will sometimes rul>olf, dis- 
 playing its oily fat covering beneath. The pure Chi- 
 nese is very susceptible of^ cold, and too delicate to 
 be acclima.ed in tiiis country; its only valuable qual- 
 ity is its great aptitude to iiittcn on a comparatively 
 small amount of food of indifferent quality. If fed 
 on farinaceous food, and not made too fat, tlie flesh is 
 delicate, but if animal food has been much introdu- 
 ced, such as greaves, &c., and highly fattened, the 
 flesh is coarse and the fat oily an I disagreeable; they 
 make nice sucking pigs and dairy fed porkers; the 
 latter good, whether used for roasting or pickled 
 pork; they are prolific, but bad mothers. 

Tiie Neapolitan stock is the one from which our 
 improved smaller breeds are indebted for their most 
 admired qualities. The Neapolitan pig has a small- 
 er quantity of bone in proportion to its size than 
 any oiher breed; the colour black, great aptitude to 
 fatten at an early age, a id will put on flesh with a 
 moderate amount of food rf indifferent quality; in 
 fact, will get into something bettor than store con- 
 dition by grazing: they are moderately prolific, and 
 excellent sucklers; average produce of a litter from 8 
 to 9. I have both heard and soon it remarked that 
 they are bad mothers; whenever I have had an op- 
 portunity of tracing such rumors to their sources, I 
 have invariably found that the want of milk has 
 arisen in consequence of bing allowed to get too fat 
 whilst with young: in fiict, so great is the tendency 
 4 of this breed to put on fat during the period of ges- 
 tation, that they will almost get over fat by being 
 merely left in the straw-yard, to which place they 
 are a valuable assistant, being inveterate rooters. 
 Tills breed is to be distinguished from the bl.ack Chi- 
 nese breed by its larger frame, greater general sym- 
 metry, and much sharper sinmt; in proportion to its 
 size, it is not so long in the body as the Chinese; it is 
 destitute of Iniirs. 

The varied intermi.'Cture of the breeds already en- 
 umerated constitute the whole of the varieties of 
 swine known amongst farmers, the three grand dis- 
 tinctive features of which are, th ;t for size of frame, 
 but ii, aptitude to fatten until they are 12 or 16 
 months old, we must look to the flop-eared old Eng- 
 lish breed; for very early aptitude to fatten from the 
 time of farrowing until they are 10 or 12 months old. 
 we must resort to the Chinese. If properly kept from 
 the first, this breed will be found to pay best byjiill- 
 ing tlioni between 9 and 10 months of age. For 
 symmjtry, m.iderate siza, flavour of meat, aptitude 
 to fatten, and excellent nurse.-i, as a self breed, there 
 is none to conipave with the Neapolitan; it p:vys best 
 to kill this ijreed at from 9 to 12 muntlis old. The 
 improved Essex breeil is a slight improvement in 
 the Neapolitan; in external appearance they closely 
 resemble each other. 

N itwith.st.inding the relative and distinctive excel- 
 lencies of the breed.< named, it is possible.by judicious- 
 ly crossing them, that the excellencies of one kind 
 may be intermixed with the desirable qualities of 
 another; thus the slow fattening quality of the old 
 English breed may be improved by crossing with the 

Chinese — in this way the celobiated Berkshiic pij; 
 was first obtained. A description of the indigenous 
 Berksliire hog has already been given; and in proof 
 of the statement here made I shall quote the worde 
 of the author of the "Berk.sliire County (Survey, 
 1809," who states: — "But excellent as the Belh^hire 
 swine undoulitcdly are, they are u.':ually crof-K d at 
 intervals with the Chinese or Tonquin race. Mr. 
 Smith, Sr., of Leieomb Basset, who has sttuhed ih« 
 breed of nulive cuiimah for many years, a^surt■d me 
 that it was necessary to cross the Berkshire swine 
 once in six or seven generations with (he Indian 
 race, or they would degenerate in sliape and quali- 
 ties." By comparing this account of tlie niedern 
 Berkshire with the preceding one given of the old 
 specie.^, we are led to understand that a cross with the 
 Chinese has constituted a marked improvennrit in 
 the race. Now we know that the modern BeiKshire 
 hog has a tendency to fatten at a tolerably early age, 
 andean generally be turned out as fat as he can be 
 profitably made to be by the age of 14 nKmtlis. Of 
 course I here allude to hogs that have been careful- 
 ly attended to, and never allowed to fall back in m 
 the tim" they are taken from the sow until srnt to 
 the butcher; and as a generally good serviceable hog 
 at all age, from the sucking pig up to the gammon of 
 bacon, he is scarcely exeecikd by any cross or breed. 
 With resjiect to the subject of crossing I shall extend 
 these remarks to some length, as it is a most imrior- 
 tant one and the rules and circumstancss here laid 
 down and noticed are such as 1 have a!w:iv found to 
 apply, not only to hogs but to the breeding of all 
 other animals. In doing so, I shall illusirate the sub- 
 ject by an account of what fell entirely within my 
 own experience. Some years ago I puicha.-ed (wo 
 sows of a cross between the Berkshire at:d Chinese, 
 containing more of the Chinese than the Berk.-hirCja 
 circumstance that I did not particularly admiie, ;i8 I 
 givvays found that, when (he Chinese blood predom- 
 inates,the frame is sacrificed without a corresponding 
 advantage in the propensity to fatten. At the time 
 alluded to it was, however, the practice to breed \ery 
 fine in order to obtain a descriplion th.it arrived at 
 early maturity. I put them both to a very fine Nea- 
 politan boar; in due season one farrowed 10 and the 
 other 11 young ones. I ought to have remarked that 
 the two sows were perfectly white, modera(ely cover- 
 ed with bristles: as far as 1 could trace the paioniage 
 of the sows the whole of their progenitors h:Kl been 
 of a white colour; the Neapolitan boar vi'as perfectly 
 black, and devoid of hair; under these circumstances 
 no surprise would have been expressed at seeing the 
 progeny a mixed lot of white, black, and bla-k and 
 white, all of which were to be found, and in addition 
 were some covered with slightly curled bristles of a 
 brown or bro\vinsh-red colour, streaked down the 
 sides with deep-brown strines, something similar to 
 the tiger. The white pigs turned out very good ones, 
 matured eirly, and f;ittened on little find, and were 
 something similar to the best types of the ckiss be- 
 tween the Berkshire and Chinese; not quite so largo, 
 however, as this cross is usually seen, but larger than 
 their mothers, w-hich, 'is I previously remarked, had 
 too much of the Chinese. The black pigs approach- 
 ed their size in ohar.acter, but had a larger fra .e: 
 these throve well, better than any of the other kinds 
 which could easily bo noticed, as they wore all fed 
 together. The brown species hail ears somewhat in- 
 clined to the pendulous, and were of a larger fr.m e 
 and longer body than the others; when killed, woie 
 much heavier and lar",'r than the rest, but hey to. k 
 a month to .six. weeks longer feeding. I always con^ 
 sidcred these brown pi^s as typical of the BerksUirQ
