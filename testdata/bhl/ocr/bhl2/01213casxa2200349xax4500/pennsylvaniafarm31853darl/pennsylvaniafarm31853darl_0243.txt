UougUtuu's S edliu^ Gauseberry. 

This variety, though not large, will always be val- 
 ued on aoiiount of its abundant and regular bearing, 
 and unliki many of ihe fine English sorts, not being 
 subject to MUdaw. It ripens soon after uiid-summer. 
 Skin smooth, thi n, glossy, of a pale dull reddish 
 brown color, marked witii faint greenish lines. We 
 copy from the Boston Cultivator, the following ac- 
 count of its origin: 

Meisrs. Editors: — ^I observed in the Cultivator of 
 the 25tii June, an account ot the "Iljughton Seed- 
 ling Goosberry," with a drawing of the same. It is 
 there stated, that it originated in Salem, Massachus- 
 etts, which is a mistake. The gousberry was raised 
 by me from the seed in 1833, when 1 resided in Lynn. 
 It is a cross between oar native and some foreign 
 kind. After experimenting there for many years 
 with the most choice foreign varieties, such as the 
 'British Crown,' 'Empire,' 'Uook's Uetiauce,' 'Bang 
 Up,' 'Roaring Lion,' and about every other roaring 
 kinds, many uf which I imported from the London 
 Horticultural Society, nearly all of which proved 
 worthless, on account of their blasting with mildew. 
 Having selected four choice kinds, viz: 'Crown Bob,' 
 'White Smith,' 'Wnite Rock,' and the 'Red Cham- 
 pagne,' I procured from the woods one of our best 
 native kinds, and planted it in the centre. Tae sec- 
 ond year after planting, all bore fruit, letting the 
 fruit remain on until perfectly ripe, and when it had 
 fallen off I t irew over it a slight covering of loam. 
 In the following Spring, the young plants came up in 
 great numbers. I transplanted into nursery rows 
 about one hundred plants, and cultivated them with 
 care for five years. 

The fifth year, nearly all bore fruit, the greater 
 part of vvliich was completely covered with mildew; 
 even the bushes themselves were so covered that not 
 a green leaf was to be seen. Having discarded all 
 but the above named one, and having cultivated that 
 over fif.een years, I have felt fully compensated for 
 my experiment and trouble, having found the above 
 named gooseberry perfectly free from blight or mil- 
 dew, and a constant and enormous bearer: of its oth- 
 er merits, I leave others to judge.

Cattle Mariet Abuses. 

The Gr ind Jury of Kings county are occupied with 
 the discussion ot a ijuestiou of vast importance, 
 which should be brouglit at onci before the same 
 body in this city. It is on the maltreatment of cat- 
 tle by the drovers during their long preginations 
 from the West, and by the butchers after they have 
 arrived here. 

It is truly said, 'one half of the world do not know 
 how the other half live,' and it is equally true that 
 if on.! half knew what sort of food they eat, they 
 would cease to live, through very disgust at what 
 they feed upon. What think t.ie beel-eaters of this 
 city of the condition of their favorite food under these 
 circumstances: First they are confined in a crowded 
 space five days on a steamboat, tossing over the waves 
 of Lakes Michigan, Huron and Erie, with but little 
 opportunity or disposition to eat or sleep, though in 
 stormy passages with no lack of chances to drink. 
 Then, by way of change, they are are shut up in a 
 railroad car three or four days longer, until almost 
 exhausted in the hot sun, and, as has been proved, in 
 som; instances, oT hours without water, 'i'hen they 
 are allowed to drink till thoy look full and fat enough 
 to stand another day in the cattle market, and en- 

dure all the lioi'king and pushing of infuriated beasts.. 
 Then they suffer all the punching and boating with 
 clubs of their unfeeling owners and half savage boys, 
 who drive them through the streets, until they finally 
 reach the pens of the abattoirs, cither excited to 
 madness, or so exhausted with want of food and rest, 
 and consequent fever, that bullocks, once as lithe as 
 deer, go like lambs to the slaughter, without resis- 
 tance. 

We have in fact, repeatedly stood by and seen them 
 bow their heads to the fatal noose, with which they 
 had just seen their prison-mate drawn up to the bull- 
 ring, with looks and actions seeming to show that 
 they understood their fate as well as the butcher 
 could tell them, but deemed it a relief their misery. 
 After having been put up in the shambles, snuffing 
 the blood of their fellows for three or four days with- 
 out tasting food or water, their sufferings may be im- 
 agined. 

We have read of savage nations who fit their beef 
 for eating by baiting the cattle to death with fero- 
 cious dogs. By this they are thrown into a high 
 fever much more rapidly, and hence humanely, than 
 by our steamboat, railroad, and butcher-pen process. 
 But they were savages — we are civilized. They are 
 heathen — we are Christians. Other nations fit their 
 beef for human food by first binding the animal, 
 neck and heels, and then beating him to death with 
 clubs. This makes ihe meat lender. We have a dif- 
 ferent process of producing the same effect. Theirs is 
 barbarous — ours belongs to an enlightened and hu- 
 mane people, who live in the nineteenth century, and 
 boast of their intelligence, and make laws to "pre- 
 vent cruelty to animals." 

We do not allow a man to beat and misuse his' 
 horse, because, if he dies the dogs may eat him. But 
 we do eat beef, and do cot ask the question how it is 
 prepared for our delicate stomixchs. 

If such a singiilar phenomenon should ever hap- 
 pen in this city, that a Grand Jury should be dis- 
 posed to ask whether cattle are treated quite as hu- 
 manely as would be altogether acceptable in the sight 
 of him who made both man and brute, we hope they 
 will send us a polite invitation to attend their inves- 
 tigation. In such case let them not be contented with 
 mere hearsay evidence. Let them personally visit 
 some of the places we can point out to them, where 
 beef is prepared for a people so refined that they 
 would be horrified at the public exhibition of cruel- 
 ty to animals in the plaza de torn.t, but who pander 
 to worse cruelties every day inflicted upon the ani- 
 mals whose flesh, after being duly prepared and 
 spoiled, will be served up as their own daily food." 

If any of our readers partake of these sins, in any 
 form, we hope they will repent forthwith, and amend 
 their ways. Something more than mere mere taste 
 is concerned in these matters. — [New York Tribune. 

Spare the Birds. — On no pretext whatever, should 
 farmers or gardeners permit their birds to b'' des- 
 turbed. Instead of killing them or frightening them 
 away, they should make use of every means in their 
 power to induce them to increase in numljer, and be- 
 come more tame and familiar. Tln! worst of them 

, earn twenty times what they eat; and then, what ex- 
 quisite pleasure, to have your garden, yard, orchard, 

{ or wood, alive and vocal with the music of merry 
 birds. Plant trees for them, build houses if neei!s- 

' sary for them, and let no cat, dog, or boy ever mo- 

1 lest them, and they will teach you lessons uf domes- 
 tic bliss — preach you sermons — and warble you such 
 hymns as you never hoard elsewhere. Bo kind to 

' your birds. — Ohio Farmer.
