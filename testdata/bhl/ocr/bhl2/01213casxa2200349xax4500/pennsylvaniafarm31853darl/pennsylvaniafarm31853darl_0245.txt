by Seymour & Mori^an's Patent fur 1853, New York 
 Reaper, in 31 minutes. This maebine requires a 
 man to drive and another to raise off the grain. 
 The gavels are laid off at the side, and with great 
 regularity, by an expert raker. It is worked with 
 ease, has a light draught, and can cut from 15 to 20 
 acres per day, with one span of horses, and do the 
 work better than is done by ordinary cradling. Man- 
 ufactured at Brockport. 

Manny's Patent Adjustable Northern Illinois 
 Reaper and Mower cut its acre of wheat well and 
 rapidly, the grain being laid off .it the side by a ra- 
 ker. This Reaper took the second prize of $30 at 
 the trial at Geneva, N. Y., in competition with elev- 
 en other machines, and the first prize, a silver med- 
 al, at the Ohio State Fair. Over 300 of these ma- 
 chines were in use the past season, and the demand 
 is daily increasing. 

P.\LMER & \Vi[,li.\m's Reaper and Seif-Raker, 
 1853, patented in 1851, attracted much attention. It 
 required but a single person to work it, as by an in- 
 genious, yet simple arrangement, the grain is laid 
 off at the side in gavels in such a size as the driver 
 chooses to deliver them. In partially lodged grain; 
 Wednesday, an acre was cut in 42 minutes; in the 
 standing wheat, Thursday, in 36 minutes. The de- 
 livery of the grain was very good on Thursday. 
 Manufactured at Brockport; price $138. 

The simplest constructed reaper on the ground 
 was Ilussey's Improved Patent by Ball, Autraan & 
 Co., Canton Ohio. It does its work very rapidly, 
 cuts clean, and is not liable to get out of repair. A 
 driver and raker are required, the gavels are laid off 
 evenly in the rear, but it is necessary that the bind- 
 ers should follow the machine so as to remove the 
 grain before the horses return for another clip. The 
 acre of partially lodged grain was cut in 37 minutes; 
 the standing on Thursday in 33 minutes. The Ilua- 
 sey Reaper has been tested for years, is popular with 
 farmers, and finds a ready market. 

Atkin's Automaton, or Self-Raking Reaper and 
 Mower, attracted the attention of everybody when- 
 ever in motion. It comes nearer to a human reap- 
 er than anything made with hands, and does its 
 work fast and well. It was tried successfully in the 
 harvest of 1852 in the vicinity of Chicago, and was 
 awarded first premiums at several State and other 
 Exhibitions. The striking feature of the machine is 
 an automaton arm, terminating in a rake, which 
 seizes the grain as the reaper moves along, and by a 
 rotary movement lays the gavel off regularly at the 
 side, then extending itself, returns to its work, re- 
 minding one strongly of the active intelligence ex- 
 hibited by the power printing press in laying off the 
 printed sheets. The Se'f Raker scatters the grain 
 somewhat in disposing of the gavels, but not much 
 more than the machine rakes by hand; and it is less 
 work to glean and I ind .after the Automaton than 
 after the common cradle. It is the invention of Mr 
 Atkins, an old millwright at Chicago, wlio has been 
 bed-ridden for ten years and never saw his remark- 
 able piece of mechanism in operation. The Autom- 
 aton has been patented in England. Price at Chi- 
 cago $175,00. It is not warranted as a Jlowcr, but 
 works very well it is said. 

After a full and fair test of all the Respers exhib- 
 ited, the .ommittee, as we understand, unanimously 
 awarded the first premium, a gold medal of the val- 
 ue of §50, to Seymour & Morgan's New York Reap- 
 er. No second premium was awarded, the commit- 
 tee being divided in opinion between Palmer & Wil- 
 liams' Reaper and SelfRiker, and Ilussey's Improv- 
 ed Patent Reaper, by Ball, Autman & Co. The 

world-famous MuCormick Reaper was not exhibited, 
 the proprietor choosing to rest on his English laur- 
 els which we believe have not been brightened by 
 any American competition encountered since the 
 London Fair. 

Several improved Agricultural Implements for 
 which no premiums had been offered were on the 
 ground, among them a buggy-like Hay Rake inge- 
 niously adapted to wheels so that the raker mdc lei- 
 surely over the field smoking his pipe; Killam & 
 Valleau's Patent Wheeled Cultivating Gang Plows, 
 made at Scottsville, N. Y., said to be the "most use- 
 ful improvement which has been made in plows 
 since the issue of Wood's old patent; and Borst's 
 Improved Grain Drill, manufactu'-ed at AVadsworth, 
 .Medina county, and which took the first premium at 
 the State Fair last fall. The price is $50, and the 
 demand is so increased that the manufacturers will 
 dispose of 250 this season. 

Whi) is David Taffgartf 

One D.avid Taggart, of Northumberland, Pa., is 
 amusing liimself, (we presume.) in the Farm Jour- 
 nal, a la Miner and King, in throwing soft-shell 
 "bricks" at us. We are not apprised (jf the "war" 
 he alludes to, at all — and r;ither reckon he doesn't 
 read the papers! Will the editor of the "Journal" 
 inform us who is David Taggart, whar' he comes 
 from, and what business he has {if any) with our af- 
 airs? 

In answer to above enquiry in the New England 
 Cultivator, wo roply, David Taggart is one of our 
 most intelligent correspondents, corr. secretary of a 
 County Agricultural Society, well posted up in all 
 matters relative to rearing Poultry, the different 
 breeds, &e., and moreover, writes with a steel pen, 
 and is able to use it, either on the offensive or defen- 
 sive, with great vigor and effect. 

From some cause or other, the agricultural press 
 north and east of us, seem to have got into a condi- 
 tion of mutual recrimination an 1 distrust, not only 
 on the qui vive for something or somebody to attack; 
 but actually qitite eager, judging from the above, for 
 a fray, and some new opponent, to practise their 
 skill upon. Remaining in a kind of armed non inter- 
 vention, when not openly engaged in hostilities, they 
 have become suspicious, and iniaijiiie themselves at- 
 tacked personally in their paper, when one ventures to 
 express a mere difference of opinion. We hope sin- 
 cerely none of the belligerents are going to make a 
 descent upon Pennsylvania, for although there aro 
 none but militia men and raw recruits here, past ex- 
 perience has proved, some of those can act efficiently 
 an an emergency. To read the pages of some of our 
 cotemporaries at the north, and the way they keep 
 at it, to the non edification of their readers, one is 
 reminded of the Iri hman with his favorite shillalah, 
 who merely stopping to .ask if it ii a free Ji'jht. 
 jumps right into the middle of the fray, and lays a- 
 bout him with a hearty good will, from the pure ab- 
 stract I leasure of the thing. 

If there are any classes of people in the country,
