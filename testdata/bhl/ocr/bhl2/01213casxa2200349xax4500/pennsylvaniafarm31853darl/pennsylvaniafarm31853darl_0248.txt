being generally several cents below that of this State, 
 on account uf the very imperfect manner in which i' 
 is cleaned. 

This promises to be a very valuable improved ma- 
 chine for all wheat growers. Let them look at it, 
 and hear the owner's explanation." 

The Farmer's Machine is used by hand, and is 
 capable of cleaning from fifteen to forty bushels per 
 hour. . _ 

It will separate from wheat, chess, cockle, pigeon 

and red-root seeds, sraut-balls, dead kernels, and the 

majority of oats and garlick, and all other impuri- 
 ties. 

It will clean oats, peas, beans, corn, barley, rye, 

garden seeds and rice. It will separate oats from 

peas, beans and corn, and any two seeds where there 

is a material difference in size and weight. 

It will clean all kinds of grass seeds and clover, 
 and separate clover from timothy; also separate yel- 
 low seed from flax seed, and all other impurities. 

The Miller's Machine is similarly constructed, and 
 is propelled by machinery with less than half horse, 
 power, and is capable of separating from 50 to 200 
 bushels per hour, according to size. 

It will do equally as good work as the Farmer's 
 Machine, and has been amply tested and well re- 
 commended, and found worthy of a place in all good 
 Flouring Mills. 

This machine, with only a part of its present im- 
 provements, received a diploma at Utica, N. Y., State 
 Fair, last Fall. 

The Proprietor, G. B. Salmon, will be found at the 
 Crystal Palace during its opening, or at 93 West 13th 
 street. New York.

Splendid Poultry. 

We had the pleasure a few days since, of exam- 
 ining a lot of forty-two pairs of fowls, raised near 
 this place, for our friend Aaron Clement, of Philadel- 
 phia, and which were about starting to Philadelphia 
 in the cars. They were Cochin China, and white 
 Shanghai varieties, and take them all together, were 
 about the best lot for their age we have yet seen. 
 Some of them were really model fowls, well propor- 
 tioned, of great size, and their appearance indicated, 
 purity of blood. A. C. informs us that they have 
 been bred from the most reliable sources. They will 
 be held for sale at his residence. South street above 
 Ninth, Philadelphia. 

He also acts as agent for the purchase and sale of 

improved breeds of cattle, sheep and swine, and to 
 those at a distance, who have occasion to purchase, 
 we can say from our own knowledge, his judgment 
 and experience are entirely reliable. 

Destroy the Apple Worm. 

The present season will be a good time to diminish 
 the number of the apple worm. 

As there will not be so many apples, as usual, of 
 course, there cannot be so m.any of these insects 
 propagated, and an opportunity thus offers to thin oflT 
 the remainder, so that the apples which grow another 
 year, will not be so much infested with them. 

There are several ways by which this may be done. 
 One way, is to let hogs or sheep run in the orchard, 
 which will be likely to eat the apples which these 
 worms cause to fall, and thus destroy them. 

Another mode is to gather up the wind-falls, and 
 either throw them over i;o the hogs, or cook them and 
 mix them with the swill that you feed to the hogs, 
 and thus be sure to destroy thum. 

There is another way by which many of them can 
 be entraped and kiUiid. These worms sometimes 
 leave the apple while it hangs on the tree, and crawl 
 down the trunk in search of some convenient place, 
 to spin their cocoon, in which to undergo their trans- 
 formation, in a miller or moth state. 

If you place a woolen rag in the crotch of the tree, 
 the worms in their journey down, will be very likely 
 to come in contact with it, and finding it warm and 
 comfortable, will be likely to crawl under it, and spin 
 cocoons there. 

They can then be discovered by lifting up the cloth, 
 and thus easily destroyed. It is worth some little 
 pains to diminish their numbers at this time. — [Maine

County Fairs iu Ohio. 

To give an idea of the work there is to do in the 
 Keystone State, to enable her to keep up with the 
 times, we mention on authority of the Ohio Cultiva- 
 tor, that seventy county Fairs are to be held this fall 
 in Ohio, and that out of eighty-eight counties in the 
 State, seventy-five have an organised Agricultural 
 Society. This exceeds that of New York byone half, 
 and is three or four times as many as any other State 
 can boast of. It seems but comparatively a tow years 
 ago, when Ohio was considered the far West, and 
 now at her State Agricultural shows — the people are 
 counted by the acre. 

A New Catalpa. — Dr. AVarder, in the August 
 number of the Western Horticulturist, gives an ac- 
 count of a new variety ot the Catalpa, which he 
 ground owing in D;.yton, 0. It blooms two or three 
 weeks earlier than the other variety. The bark of 
 the young trees is lighter in color, the foliage of a 
 deep green aud more luxuriant; the seed pods much 
 longer; the form of the tree more upright and com- 
 pact, the flower larger and a purer white. They are 
 very plenty in Dayton, vi'here they were first intro- 
 duced some years since by Dr. J. Haines, from two 
 trees which he found on a farm two miles south of 
 that city. Where the original trees were obtained is 
 not known.— Ohio Farmer.
