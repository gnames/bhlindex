236 GUANO— ROSE BUSH— SUPER PHOSPHATE OF LTME-VICIOUS HORSE. [October 

cultural Societies Id place of the paltry sums com- 
 monly offered in money. 

In this country where every farmer is a freeman 
 with high privileges to look after, it becomes him to 
 improve his mind. This he cannot do without books 
 which are not only requisite for his own instruction 
 but for that of the children entrusted to his care. It 
 is only when physical power is directed by proper in- 
 telligence that it accomplishes its greatest results in 
 agriculture as well as all other branches of the in- 
 dustrial arts. 

Experiment with Guano, Pure and Mixed, on 
 Wheat. 

A correspondent of the New York Agrioultor, da- 
 ting Accoma, C. H„ Va., June 18, 1853, says: 

"Last Fall, when sowing my wheat, I laid off four 
 contigU(jus parcels, of one-sixth acre each, to which 
 I applied the following substance, viz: 

No. 1. Guano alone, 25 lbs. 

No. 2. G..ano 25 lbs., Plaster 6 lbs. 

No. 3. Guano 25 lbs., and peck charcoalin half the 
 quantity jf Guano by measure. 

No. 4. Guano 25 lbs., moistened with strong lime. 

Otherwise they were treated precisely alike. The 
 substances were mixed the day before application. 

"I have observed them closely, and the results are 
 as follows: 

Until this Spring, I could perceive no difference; 
 then I found No. 1 and No. 3, taking the lead of the 
 others, and they have continued to do so till the pres- 
 ent, when my wheat is nearly ready for the scythe. 
 If any difference exists between No. 1 and No. 3, I 
 think No. 1 is rather taller and ranker, while No. 3 
 has rather longer heads. 

"My object in these experiments was to ascertain 
 whether the effects of Guano are enhanced by ad- 
 mixiure with "fixers" of ammonia. 1 was, on chem- 
 ical principle8,an advocate for adding plaster or char 
 coal; but these experiments seem to indicate no im- 
 provement in the case of one of the substances, and 
 a deterioration in that of the other, as compared with 
 Guano alone. This guano and Plaster question has 
 been a bone o( contention among chemists and ag- 
 riculturists. Only one expiriment, however, I do 
 not consider conclusive, and next Fall I intend to in- 
 stitute others." 

Treatment of a Rose Bush. 

I have possessed for many years a very fine graft- 
 ed Rose bush of the kind called Cloth of Gold; these 
 possess the peculiarity of blooming finely and freely, 
 with very large flowers, when in the green-house; but 
 in the open air the roses are not nearly so remark- 
 able. My bush began to run some three years ago 
 very rampantly; but my gardener regularly cut it 
 down to produce grafts from, losing the roses. I de- 
 termined to "make i.n example" of the specimen, 
 and proceeded as follows, with what results you shall 
 hear. 

I planted the bush under the drawing-room front 
 window, and made a plant-case, covering the sides 
 with bark to make it sightly. As soon as heavy 
 frosts set in, I bent down thn stem and fixed it there 
 with a pronged stick, covering the whole, w ich had 
 now a fine head, with glass. Being near the door, 
 and under constant observation, I treated it as is 
 usual with salad or cucumber beds — that is, I gave 

it plenty of air when the sun was on it, or the air 
 was sufficiently warm. 

The result has been, my pet has been raised up in 
 the spring in the most extraordinary vigor, health, 
 and beauty. This year it came forth with eighty- 
 four enormous buds, followed by giant flowers, so 
 much so that it became a perfect show to the neigh- 
 borhood. I branched the runners to stakes, and it 
 now measures twenty-one feet in length, and next 
 year will mount to the second stoi-y on a special trel- 
 lis. It is now perfecting a second series of buds, and 
 will continue to bloom till late in the fall. I may 
 add, that I have watered it and my other roses once 
 a week with a solution of sulphite of ammonia, in 
 the proportion of one pound to thirty gallons. Lov- 
 ers of roses will do well to try the experiment with 
 Clofli of Gold, Saffrana, Solfalare, &c. J, J. S. —

Super Phosphate of I^ime. 

Wo continue to hear from various quarters, of some 
 of our best, and most observing Practical Farmers, 
 who have tried Professor Mapes' Super-phosphate of 
 Lime. They speak to us of its effect on corn, oats, 
 wheat, grass, vegetables, &c., in the highest terms. 
 In many cases, it has proved superior to Guano, in a 
 comparative trial along side of it, and especially for 
 pasture. Whether ihis article could, or could not be 
 manufactured in England for JilOO per ton — wheth- 
 er this or that or the other analysis is correct, are 
 questions which need not be discussed in the Farm 
 Journal. What we care to know is its value for 
 farmers, hy its effects on their crops. If assured on 
 this point, our readers will be satisfied. In addition 
 to many experiments we might mention by others, 
 we have tried it ourselves, this season on oats, 200 lbs. 
 to the acre, on corn applied in the hill and on vege- 
 tables, all with satisfactory results. The cradlers in 
 cutting the oats, remarked there was double the 
 quantity on that portion. 

Since the introduction of Professor Mapes' article, 
 several others have appeared in Philadelphia and 
 New York, under the name of Super-phosphate of 
 Lime. We do not know that they have been yet ful- 
 ly tested by farmers, but we shall be happy to com- 
 municate to our readers any results from their use. 
 It is said they are equal to Professor Mapes', this be- 
 ing considered a great recommendation. We should 
 like to hear from those who have tried them. 

How to Subdue a Vicious Horse. 

On looking over some old papers the other day we 
 came across the following, which if true, is worth 
 knowing. It seems that a fruitless effort was being 
 made in a black-smith shop to shoe a vicious horso 
 which resisted all efforts, kicked aside every thing 
 but an anvil, and came near killing himself against 
 that, when by mere accident, an officer returned from 
 Mexico, was passing, and being made acquainted 
 with the difficulty, applied a complete remedy by the 
 following simple process. 

"lie took a cord about the size of a common bed- 
 cord, put it in the mouth of the horse like a bit, and 
 tied it tightly on the top of the animal's head, passing
