Ilia left ear under the string, not painfully tight, but 
 tight enough to keep the ear down and the cord in its 
 place. This done, he patted the horse gently on the 
 eide of the head, and commanded him to follow, and 
 instantly the horse obeyed, perfectly subdued and as 
 .gentle and obedient as a well-trained dog; suffering 
 his feet to be lifted with entire impunity, and acting 
 in all respects like an old stager. The simple string, 
 thus tied, had made him at once as docile and obe- 
 dient as any one could desire. The gentleman who 
 thus furnished the exceedingly simple means of sub- 
 duing a very dangerous propensity, intimated that 
 it is practised in Mexico and South America in the 
 jnanageraent of wi J horses. Be this as it may, he 
 deserves the thanks of all owners of such horses, and 
 especially the thanks of those whose business it may 
 be to shoe or groom the animals." 

Extracts from au Address 

To the Citizens of Franklin county, Pa., hy Hon. 
 George Chambers. 

The prejudice with many farmers, against book 
 learning and science applied to agriculture, is to be 
 •dispelled as unworthy of their intelligence. If we 
 do not read agricultural books and essays on improve- 
 rnients in farming, wj will be closing our eyes against 
 the light and be behind the age in which we live. 

We might refer to many examf les of a sudden im- 
 pulse give to agriculture in this country within the 
 last few years, by the publication of geological sur- 
 veys. There are several instances atteoted by in- 
 creased agricultural products in whole districts of 
 country. One is in the marl region of New Jersej', 
 where the discovery was made, by Prof. H. D. Rog- 
 ers, of the Green Marl, a sand abounding in Potash, 
 and as a valuable fertilizer has been used to a great 
 extent in New .Jeresy, to the great improvement of a 
 sterile soil, and with striking advantage. The dis- 
 covery of the abundant calcareous marl deposits, by 
 Prof Wm. B. Rogers,in Eastern Virginia,has led many 
 Northern and Eastern settlers to that worn-out re- 
 gion by the benefits to be drived from this marl manure. 
 The discovery of the phosphate of lime in New Jer- 
 sey and New York will not only benefit the farming 
 interest of those States, but is of such value, as the 
 basis of a permanent fertilizer of the soil, as to bear 
 transportation with profit even to Europe. 

There was a time wthin the memory of farmers 
 now living in Franklin county, that when Plaster of 
 Paris was first introduced for agricultural purposes, 
 it was ridiculed by the majority of fanners, as a 
 catch-penny of no benefit. And at the same lime the 
 prej-udice with many was against the introduction of 
 the red clover crop, as a new thing that would not 
 pay cost. Many preferred the "good old way" of 
 thier fathers, in having on their fields the red sorrel, 
 pigeon weed, and other abundant weeds, and not 
 only opposed the cultivation of clover, but were dis- 
 posed to charge on the fine clover fields of the neigh- 
 borhood an epidemic disease that one season sprrad 
 over the country. Yet it is that clover crop, and im- 
 proved husbandry over the "old way," that rescued 
 from sterility and barrenness a large portion of this 
 county — its former proprietors having sold their an- 
 cient homesteads for a trifle., .and sought other homes 
 at an early day on the new lands of Western Penn- 
 sylvania and elsewhere. Improved hu.sbandry since, 
 on the lands deserted, a great part of which is on the 
 waters of the Antietam, has made them the moat 
 fertile and valuable in the county. 

An intelligent farmer profits by his observation 
 and experience in the cultivation and improvement of 
 his soil, and why shall ho refuse to be informed of 
 the result of the experience of others, which may be 
 to his advantage ? He wants to increase his agricul- 
 tural products at the smallest cost, without exhaus- ' 
 ting his soil beyond his means of restoration. Every 
 discovery or improvement in cultivation, or in restor- 
 ing to the soil the ingredients withdrawn by the crop, 
 which is made by the farmer or the Chemical Pro- 
 fessor, and which may lesson labor, economize time, 
 and introduce a better system of culture, is to be en- 
 couraged as a benefit to the farmer and the commu- 
 nity. Yet this knowledge andidiscovery the farmer 
 may be able to lef^rn only from agricultural publica- 
 tions. The experience and the discoveries of others, 
 by such publications are brought home to every farm- 
 er and his family, if disposed to re.ad and learn. One 
 enterprising farmer will not do much good in his 
 own neighborhood by his experimental labors, but 
 through the agency of the press, the beneficial result 
 of those labors will be made known in remote places, 
 to the advantage of those who are desirous of informa- 
 tion in their occupation from evei-y source.

Vicious Cattle. 

The common vice of jumping and throwing fences 
 is tavght to cattle, with scarcely an exception, by 
 their owners and caretakers. Fences half down, .soon 
 fall by the rubbing of cattle, and teach the first less- 
 on, especially if cattle have any shrewdness in observ- 
 ing cause and effect. Very fine feed just over a poor 
 fence, is the next lesson; letting down bars and rail 
 fences to the halves, from laziness, so that the ani- 
 mal has to leap, is the third lesson — and this Last is 
 often first, second, and third with sheep, until they 
 will scale anything. These throe lessons are usually 
 enough, but a fourth is often added, namely, placing 
 one additional rail on the fence each successive day, 
 as they become more skilful, for the ostensible object of 
 keeping the jumper within bounds, but really oper- 
 ating as a most ingenious contrivance to teach the 
 art of vaulting. We have heard of French being 
 "taught in six lessons;" but very few animals require 
 more than the above fiiur to enable them to take 
 "French leave" of any ordinary enclosure. — [Coun- 
 try Gentleman. 

There is no more honorable occupation than agri- 
 culture — none more hcathful or more useful.
