ArtiliciU Manures. 

As Patent Manures and Fertilizers are springing 
 up In evc'ry quarter, and with "a real scieii/ific analj- 
 sis to accompany them, are being urged upon the 
 notice of our Farmers, in handbills, circulars and ad- 
 Tertisenli'nts — we copy the following well written 
 article irom the English Agricultural Gazette, as 
 quite appropriate t j the times here. There are some 
 very valuable hints in it. 

It seems English Farmers, who like the generality 
 of Farmers every where, are more used to the Farm, 
 than the laboratory, are also liable to be "oictiitiiscd." 

We commend a proper caution in purchasing to 
 much extent of new and untried artificial manures. 

What science bestows igrorance wastes, or alto- 
 gether rejects. This is a truth founded upon the ac- 
 cumulated experience of centuries; and which, even 
 in the present day ,is continually receiving fresh con- 
 tirmatiou in the mistakes and failunis which occur in 
 every department of human industry — [•'istakes and 
 failures wliich a very slight acquaintance with scien- 
 tific truth would have prevented altogether, or at 
 least rendered less disastrous. "A little knowledge 
 is a dangerous thing," but the apothegm is not e.im- 
 plote unless we add that the hss the knowledge the 
 greater the danger. Scienre with Practice is emblaz- 
 oned on the crest of the largest and most influential 
 of our agricultural societies, and the union in the 
 motto of the; head to think and the hand to execute 
 illustrates in a forcible manner the grand idea which 
 that society proposes to workout in process of time. 
 But, notwithstanding all the light which is constant- 
 ly diffusing itself from the centres of scientific effirt, 
 there are many so-called practical mi'U who holdliy 
 the converse of the English Agricultural Society's 
 motto, and who consider that Practice without Sci- 
 ence should be the watchword of the rent-paying 
 farmer. That '"one ounce of pra tice is better than 
 a whole ton of theory" is an a-isertion which has oft- 
 en done duty for arguuicnt; but how far this choice 
 morsel of logic is correct is best illustrated by the 
 records ot tliat department of firm pracice which 
 embraces the d^Uails of purchasing ami managing 
 what are called special manures, whether light or 
 heavy, damp or dry, organic or inorganic. Upon no 
 subjec' in agriculture has chemistry -'rung its cliang- 
 es" with such unceasing but fruitless industry as that 
 of the value ot manures. Not only have all the 
 proximate and useful elements been separated by 
 analysis, but, in addition, they have been lotted, 
 ticketed, weighed, and priced, in order that there 
 may be no ditiiculty in determhiing the worth of anv 
 manure of which the seller furnishes an analysis. 
 How many tons of practice will it take to analyse and 
 determuie the value of one ounce uf guano or super- 
 phosphate correctly'!' Not all the accumulateil prac- ■ 
 tical or empirical agricultural knowledge froui the 
 days of the first tiller of the soil, down to the pres- 
 ent hour, has been able to solve the problem contain- 
 ed in the question — What is the food of plants 1 
 Chemistry has certainly not made plain all the mys- 
 terious processes of vegetable life, but it has throlvn 
 a flood of light upon the composition, comparative 
 value, uses and abuses of those sub tanoes which 
 form the food of plants. Much of this light is, how- 
 ever, obscureii or lost by the want of a sufficient a- 
 muuiit ot intelligent appreciation of the practical 
 uses to which it may applied. It is a somewhat af- 
 fecting spectacle to behold an experienced farmer, 

deeply versed in the mysteries of marketing, utterly 

! helpless when the printed analysis of some manure 

I or other is placed in his hands. Experience has 

I taught him how to calculate the weight of an ox with 

admirable precision, merely by the use of his sight 

j and touch, and to work up a Turnip field with a 

I nicety that can scarcely t)e surpassed even in the 

I trimmest market-garden; but experience conveyed 

through the external senses can no more enable him 

to kn(jw the value of a manure from its analytical 

composition than it could the unlettered Arab of the 

desert to decipher the inscriptions of Nineveh of 

Kouyunjik by gazing on them, though it were for a 

life-time. 

Au instance recently came under our notice of the 
 utter uselessness of chemical analysis to the farmer, 
 when not accompanied, on his part, by some slight 
 acquaintance with its practical uses. A sale by auc- 
 tion of artificial manure had been advertised to take 
 place on a certain day of June last, in a town situa- 
 ted ill a sumewhat_/uj'-/(r)r</(. county of Scotland. The 
 owner of this manure bad, with a most praiseworthy 
 honesty, previously obtained an analysis of his ma- 
 nure from I'rof. Anderson, ot Glasgow, and on the 
 day of sale printed slips of- this analysis were Ireely 
 distributed among the assembled farmers. The ma- 
 nure Itself was couttilned In bags, and In appearance 
 Somewhat resembled good Bolivian guano, l>ut pos; 
 sessing a peculiarly putrid odour, not unlike what 
 Would be imparted by a mixture of crushed bones or 
 rotten eggs in an active state of decomposition, Its 
 composition was as follows: — 

Water, - - •- - - - 18.48 

Organic matter and amraonlacal. salts, II 85 

Pnosphates, - - • - . - 12.94

Alkaline salts, 14.32 

Sand, - - - ^ - - 14.51

This trash vv.as bought up re.adlly by several well- 
 educated and Intelligent farmers, at prices varying 
 from 4/. to 5^ per tim, as a manure for this year's 
 Turnip crop; and in one or two cases It was bought 
 on speculation to be held over to another year. A 
 very slight acquaintance with the mode of calcula- 
 ting the value of a maoure, Irom analysis, as m.ide 
 known 111 public journals by Professor Way and oth- 
 er agricultural chemists, would have hnvn that its 
 real value did not exceed 55.f. per ton when compar- 
 ed with Peruvian guano at 9/. 16.s. per ton. Accord- 
 ing to the very lowest mode of calculating the value 
 of manures — by the amuionii, phosphates, and alka- 
 line matter they contnin — the value of a ton of this 
 anlHcial manure and guano will stand thus: — 

Artificial Manure which Sold at 90s. per ton. . 
 Ammonia in a ton, 27J lbs., at 4.!(/.=£0 10 3f 
 Phosphates " 290 lbs., at |(/.= 18 IJ 
 Alkaline salts " o20J lbs., at lii.= 168

 Alkaline salts " 162A lbs., at \d.= Itj 4J 

■ Value per ton, - - - - £9 10 4-J 

From this comparison it appears that tho artiflol.il 

manure which sold so readily at 90.s. per ton was 

alkaline salts, in reality as dear as Peruvian guano at
