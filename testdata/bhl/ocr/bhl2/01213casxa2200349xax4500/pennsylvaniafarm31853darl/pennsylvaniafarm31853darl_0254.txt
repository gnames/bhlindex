able way of finding out the disease of their soil or of 
 applying a remedy. Iq Maryland, a State Chemist 
 is eraployi d at a fixed salary, to analyze soils for their 
 farmers, free of expense. A similar arrangement 
 we believe is about being made in Delaware and New 
 York, and we hope also soon in Pennsylvania. The 
 project of a Farm school, will be renewed at our next 
 legislature with better prospects of success, the bill 
 for which of course should embrace the appointment 
 of a competent State chemist. There is also another 
 class of farmers, who in the language of our corres- 
 pondent, have been "victimised" by unqualified per- 
 sons, and we have reason to believe a pretty large 
 class too. This has a tendency to induce distrust of 
 theories however beautifully worked out in the closet, 
 but which have notbeen found available or successful 
 in the practical operations of the field. Like the sub- 
 jects of Patent Medicines, the few cures, have been 
 prominently published, and the man)/ failures omit- 
 ted. We do much doubt, whether agricultural chem- 
 istry has yet reached that point, where the exact de- 
 ficienoes in a given amount of soil, and the precise 
 amount and quality of remedial agents or fertilizer's, 
 can be detailed with the accuracy of a Physicians 
 recipe, fur his patient, and with the same certainty of 
 results. There have been cases where the scientific 
 chemist has been at fault altogether. Many of the 
 processes of vegetable life, and chemical combina- 
 tions in the soil, are concealed from observatiim, and 
 affected more or less, by external causes, changes of 
 weather, &c. As a case in point, one of our friends 
 in an adjoining State, an excellent farmer as well as 
 close observer, lately informed us, that in his neigh- 
 borhood, /ormerZy noted for its large crops of Indian 
 corn, it now would not grow to make it wurth culti- 
 vating, being affected with rust, and the roots appear- 
 ing unhealthy, would skin off like a diseased potato. 
 A chemist in Philadelphia on analyzing the soil, re- 
 commended Guano and lime as what W[>s wanting. 
 This had no effect, but an ac cidental application of 
 Potash in the hill, made a great change and produced 
 fine large and luxuriant stalks of double the size of 
 the balance of the field. 

Farmers, by experiments like the above on a small 
 scale, can often do much for themselves, and with 
 the view of aiding our correspondent from Tredyffrin 
 and others, we make the first step by giving the an- 
 nexed table, of the constituents of several of our cul. 
 tivated crops which have been ascertained by careful 
 analjsis, and can be relied on. This shows what the 
 crops require, without which they cannot be grown, 
 and on the sufficiency of which in the soil, or other- 
 wise depends their healthy condition, and amount of 
 return for tabor and capital. The next step to ascer- 
 tain whether the soil is adapted by its composition, to 
 their growth, and which of them, the farmer can, as 
 before remarked do something by experiment for 
 himself, and can also be of,.en aided by a competent I 

chemist. The analyses of soil in some neighborhoods 
 or sections and overlaying certain kinds of rock ex- 
 hibits very much the same inorganic constit' ents, 
 sufficiently so for practical purposes. A division of a 
 State into geological districts, ■with an analysis of the 
 soil peculiar to each would be highly useful to the far- 
 mer. Some progress was made, a few years ago in 
 a geological survey of Pennsylvania, by authority of 
 the legislature, and then abandoned. The agricul- 
 tural no less than other important interests require 
 this to be completed witho ut delay, and as, if we re- 
 collect rightly Gov. Bigler in his last annual message, 
 recommended it or some simi lar aid to agriculture, 
 we hope someth ing may be effected the coming win" 
 ter. To meet the proposition of our correspondent 
 to be one of ten, to contribute S^lOO for a competent 
 analysis of soil in his neighborhood, we have made 
 some enquiry in Philadelphia for an agricultural 
 chemist, and will report in ano ther part of the Jcmr- 
 nal if sucjessful. We now give the analysis of 1000 
 parts of the ash of some of our most common crops. 
 It will be observed that the straw of Wheat, Barley, 
 Rye, Oats, contains a large per centage of silica, a de- 
 ficiency of this in the soil, oc casions what is gener- 
 ally termed "lodged grain." 

Sawing Machine. 

W. D. Carr, Sr., and W. D. Carr, of Coining, N. 
 Y. have invented an arrangement of the cross-cut 
 saw, by vidiich it may be operated by a single man. 
 The saw-frame or carriage is placed upon horizontal 
 ways, which rest upon the liiock or log to be cut. 
 The saw is fed to its work by means of weighted rods 
 at each extremity, passing loosely through the carri- 
 age. A reciprocating motion is given by a crank and 
 rod.

Tapioca Pudding. 
 To three pints of scalded milk, put in eight table- 
 spoonsful of Tapioca; let it stand three hours, when 
 add four eggs, season to your taste, and bake for half 
 an hour. Use any sauce your fancy or taste shall 
 dictate.
