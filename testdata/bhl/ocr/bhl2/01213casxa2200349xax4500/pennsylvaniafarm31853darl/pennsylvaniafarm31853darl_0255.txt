Tliird Aiiuual Exhibitiou of the Pemisylvanla 
 State Agricultural Society at PittsUurg. 

We have just returned from cho Third Annual Exhi- 
 bition of the Pennsylvania .State xVgricultural Socie y, 
 and sincerely congnituhite its officers and. members 
 upon the complete success which has attended their 
 efforts to establish the agricultural reputation of our 
 great State. We have the unprecedented fact to an- 
 nounce, that the farmers of Pennsylvania hiVe, in 
 the space of less than three years, attained an ex- 
 cellence in their annual exhibitions at least equal to 
 that of their brethren in other States, and which re- 
 quires double, and in some instances treble that time 
 to reach. It is doubtful whether a more successful 
 exhibition has ever been held in the United States. 
 The attendance was immense. It was estimated by 
 those familiar with crowds that more than one hun- 
 dred thousand people were present on Thursday. 
 We certainly never saw so many human beings with- 
 in a single enclosure, nor has it ever been our good 
 fortune to meet so quiet and orderly assemblage. 

We reached the grounds on Tuesday morning, and 
 although anticipating excellent arrangements, were 
 not prepared for the imposing scene there presented. 
 Every thing calculated to promote the comfort and 
 ■convenience of exhibitors and visitors had been care- 
 fully attended to. 

Immediately opposite the main entrance stood Mo- 
 ■chanic's Hall, an immonse and really imposin:; struc- 
 ture, tastefully ornamented with evergreens, and sur- 
 mounted by a handsomely carved American Eagle. 
 To the right and left of this Hall were arranged the 
 ■agricultural implements, while directly in its rear 
 was another largo building, tilled with articles full of 
 interest and value, such as locks, safes, decorative 
 iron work, fancy railing, burial cases, <fce. , Still 
 farther in the rear wis the ring for the exhibition of 
 horses, and one of the most attractive features of the 
 whole grounds. 

On the rising ground to tlie right of Mechanic's 
 Hall, were Floral Hall, the Hall for Domestic Man- 
 ufactures, Vegetable Hall, Dairy Hall, and a spa- 
 •cious tent for the exhibition of farm produce gener- 
 ally. A little to the left of the last stood the Poul- 
 try Coops, while extending completely around the 
 ■eastern, southern and Western limits ot the enclosure 
 were the stalls for horses, cattle, sheep, swine, &c. 

The President's and other small tents were appro- 
 priately arranged in various portions of the grounds' 
 the whole forming a scene of great beauty and inteir 
 ■est. 

Our limited space will not admit of more than a 
 brief general notice of the various points of interest, 
 "H'hich we regret. In our next we m;iy be able to par- 
 ticularize. 

The display in Mechanic's Hall was perhaps one 
 of the finest ever made in our country. Here the 
 manufacturing spirit of Pittsburg shone in all its 

glory, and an examination of the various useful and 
 truly beautiful articles exhibited, conveyed to the 
 stranger a better idea of the enterprise and skill of 
 the inhabitants of the "smoky city," than a month's 
 sojourn within its busy walls could have done. 

pMral IIM was the most attractive. Here, the 
 skill and taste of the fair ladies of Pittsburg were 
 most admirably displayed. It was one hundred feet 
 long by fifty in width, and abounded with displays 
 of elegant ingenuity. In the centre, stood an ellipti- 
 cal platform, on tlie top of which was erected a 
 Moorish Temple, the outsids covered with moss and 
 handsome decorations. Arounl this platform, as 
 well as around the walls, were displayed choice fruits, 
 designs, flowers, &;., while on the top, surrounding 
 the temple, were handsomely arranged specimens of 
 the handiwork of the ladies. The walls were cover. 
 ■ii. with fine oil painting, immense mirrors, elegant 
 needle wcrk, &c. The pillars supporting the hall, 
 looked beautifully amid the profusion of flags, stream- 
 ers, bouquets, &c., which were clustered around them. 
 The Society was indebted to Mrs. A. W. Loomis and 
 other ladies of Pittsburg and vicinity, for the rare 
 elegance of Floral HvU, and to them are justly due 
 not only the thanks of tha Society, but of the hun- 
 dred thousand pleasant visitors who thronged its 
 beautiful portals during the entire exhibition. 

In the rear of Floral Hall stood a very large tent, 
 for the exhibition of articles of domestic manufac- 
 ture, such as quilts, specimens of raw and manufac- 
 tured srlk, woollen, cotton and silk stockings, &c. 
 An idea of the number of articles exhibited here 
 may be formed fr<)m tlu fact, that this tent, although 
 nearly three hundred foet in circumference, was co'ii- 
 plctcly filled. Many of the articles were of rare 
 beauty and merit, and the whole formed a most pleas- 
 ing exhibition of female skill and taste. . ' • 
 Adjacent to the^ last was another capacious tent, set 
 apart for the exhiuilion of green liouse plants, itc. 
 Although not so well filled as the last, the specimens 
 were.manyol them, very fine and beautiful, attr- cl- 
 ing marked attention. 

At a short distance to the left stood Dairy Hall, a 
 small tent filled to its utmost capacity with the pro- 
 ducts of the dairy. We h:td anticipated a larger dis- 
 play in this department. The quality of the butter, 
 cheese and honey, however, was excellent. We 
 woiild respectfully suggest the propriety of having 
 more enlarged accommodations for dairy products, as 
 the small tent wa , densely crowded during the en- 
 tire exhibition. 

The Poultry Department was well represented, and 
 here oumiietition run high. Nearly two thousand 
 fowls were exhibited, many of them remarkal)Ie for 
 beauty and size, and all of them giving marked evi- 
 dence of c-arc in breeding. 

Of Horses there was quite a large number on ex- 
 hibition, and their quality better than at any of the
