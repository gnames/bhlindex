[October 

Tioga County. 

As nolieeJ in our List number, the proposed meet- 
 ing to fiirui an Agricullurai Society in this county, 
 was duly held in the C curt House, at Wellsborough' 
 September 5th, and organized by calling George M'- 
 Leod, Ksq., to the chair; a society was regularly 
 formed, a constituti on adopted, and officers appoint- 
 ed aa follows: 

Presiilent — Daniel L. Slierwood. 
 A'ice Presidents— T. L, Baldwin, 'William B. Cly. 
 nier, James Lowrey, Henry P. A^anness, Jas. Knox. 

Rec. Sec'ry.— F. E. Smith. 

Cur. do. — Jami\s R. Wilson. 

Treasurer — John T. Donaldson. 

And 2-t members of an Executive Committee. We 
 are well acquainted in this border county, of Penn'a. 
 and are surprised such a movement has not been 
 made before. Iler soil is not only productive for 
 farming, but she is rich in mineral wealth, and con- 
 tains in her Blossburg Basin, immense quantities of 
 the finest Iron, coal, and potter's clay; a railroad con- 
 nects these with the Now York improvements. Be- 
 ing personally acquainted with the intelligent Cor- 
 responding Secretary, an officer on whom much of 
 the efficiency of such societies depends, we shall ex- 
 pect a good deal frofti his well known energy and 
 ability. 

Susquehanna County Fair. 

The Annual Exhibition and Cattle Show of the 
 Susquehanna County Agricultural Society, will be 
 held at Mintrose, ou t!ij 13th inst. Ploughing match 
 on tliel2th. 

This is on; of the m )st spirited of our county So- 
 cieties. The enterprise and skill of such men as 
 Judge Jessup,- Messrs. Walker, Drinker, Carmalt, 
 Ward, Post, and m vny others, have given her quite a 
 prominence through the Statj, and which Oie famous 
 crop of corn, raised by our friend Gaorgd Walker, has 
 tended to increase. We observe also, both at the last 
 and present S:ate Fair, a promiufii far the best firkin 
 butter has bjan- awarded to S-irah M. Walker, of 
 Woodbourne, in that o ninty. AVe hope to be advised 
 of what is going ou there in ajjrioultural matters. 

UniiiU County. 

This is one of the finest agricultural counties in Penn- 
 sylvania, her fertile v.illeys being famous for wheat, 
 which is the great staple. Tlie excellence of her 
 soil, early attracted the attention of many farmers 
 from Chester county, who wore among the original 
 settlers, and afterwlirds of the Germans, who now 
 form a considerable portion of the population. 

We have been pleased to observe they have late- 
 ly starte<l an Agricultural Society, which goes into 
 operation under the most favorable auspices, and 
 will be highly useful. Through the attention of the 
 Sacretary, 0. N. Worden, Esq., of Lewisburg, we 

have recei\ed a copy of the constitution, which em- 
 braces in its object, improvement in Agriculture, 
 Horticulture, and Domestic and Household Arts. Its 
 officers are, 

Jacob Grundy, President, 

20 A'^ice Presidents, 

Robert H. Lain, Treasurer, 

Richard A'. B. Lincoln, Cor. Secretary.

 be held at New Berlin, on the 13th and 14th of Oc. 
 tober. An address is lo be delivered by David Tag- 
 gart, Esq., of Northumberland, which we are confi-
