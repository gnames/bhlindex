GS,) I will relate that wliicli now stands on historic 
 veconi. A few years ajco, Amasa Turner ami Seih 
 JiiffersoH, of Mantua, Ohio, measured the shelled 
 corn raised on an acre lielunf^ini; to Seth Harmon, 
 Esq., and found it to be lOS liushels and 21 rjuarts— 
 in 1835 Mr. Asliael Renwick of Pickw.iy co., Ohio, 
 raised 5G00 liushels on 40 acres, boinj!; 140 bushels 
 to the acre. In the same state, John Lou^.'^hry, ot 
 Adams CO., raised 1500 bushels of shelled c.rn on 
 eleven acres, being over 130 bushels per a^re. In 
 our state, Joshua Evans, raised in Washington Co., 
 680 bushels en five acres, being 110 bu.-^hels per acre; 
 Mr. Pasehall Morris, near West Chester, i hester 
 CO., in 1845, raised 101 bushels and 3 pecks per acre 
 for 10 acres. In Dunham, Conn., in 1844 Mr. Wads- 
 worth raised a crop of shelled corn on \ of an acre, 
 at the rate (pf 151 bushels a id 18 qts. per acre. In 
 Now York S ate, Mr. J. F. Jones, of Sullivan co.,in 
 1849, raised over 195 bushels of ears per acre; Wil- 
 liam II. Crawford, same Co., in the same year, raised 
 lOOJ- bushels shelled corn per acre; Mr. Stevens of 
 Iloboken raised over 118 bushels per acre; in Che- 
 nango CO., in 1831, Mr. B. Butler, raised 140 bushels 
 from one acre; in 1840, W. Ingals of Oswego co., 
 raised 154 bu>hels cm an acre; B. Bradley, Bloom- 
 field CO., in 1841, raised 232 bushels, on 2 acres; in 
 1''42, Cayuga co., Mr. .Samuel I'helps raised 122 
 bushels on one acre; in the same year Wilcox, of 
 Saratoga, raised 132 liushels of shelled corn per acre; 
 Mr. Jahes Burroughs of Chat:ii|ue eo., in 1840, ub 
 tained a premium for a crop of 114 bushels and 32 
 lbs. of shelled corn per acre. The Messrs. Pratts of 
 Easton, in 1822, obtained from 3 acres, a crop of 
 517i bushels of shelled corn, a little over 172 bush- 
 els per acre; and the next year they raised from 4 
 acre , G80 bushels or 170 bushels per acre; Mr. Wil- 
 niarth of Taunton, (Mass.) in i825 raised 142 bush- 
 els on an acre; and in the same state. Leonard Hill, 
 Esq., of Plymouth, in 1823 raised 139 bu-hels of 
 shelled corn per acre, for which he received the pre- 
 mium. In New Hampshire, Mr. R. Lamprey, of 
 Moultonborough, in 1839, raised 131 bushids on an 
 acre; and the same year, same state, P. V. Pillsbury 
 of Tufton borou;;h, raised 130 bushels on one acre. 
 In Boorlion co., Kentui'.ky, Mr. George W. Williams, 
 in 1840, raised 159 2-9 bushels per acre; and Mr. 
 Young of the same state in the same year, raised

If you think the above worthy a place in the col- 
 nms of y ur paper, you are at liberty to insert it; if 
 not, reject it. Yours,

In addition to the above, we find it stated in the 
 "(ienesee Farmer," for the present month, that six 
 different counties in Ohio awarded premiums on 
 twenty-five acres i^f corn hist year, whos! average 
 product was 127 bushels per acre. The largest yield 
 was in Stark county, two acres producing 320 bush- 
 els, or 103 per acre. — /Susquehanna Register.

Strawberry Questiun. 

Our present number contains a long article on this 
 vexed question, almost sufficient of itself to form a 
 treatise. Having promised the author space for 
 another hearing, we ould not well decline j)ublish- 
 ing it, which we should h.avc dune had we been a,i- 
 priscd of its great length. 

The imp)rtince of tho ubject to practical farmers 
 will not warrant the use of so much space, particu- 

larly as it has now been narrowed down to a mere 
 abstract point. It seems to be admitted all around, 
 that a bed of pistillate varieties will not produce a 
 lull crop without the presence of staminates. This 
 is n ot the question at issue, but wdiether, iindcr any 
 circumslances. a pistillate plant will vary its prevail- 
 ing characteristics, be liable to become staminate or 
 j perfect, and produce fniit. On the one side it is con- 
 tended this is impossible, and as unnatural as for a 
 cow to turn into a bull, the pistillate or other pecu- 
 liarity being the/ia-tii law oi its nature — its true nor- 
 mal condition. By fruit, in this connection, we un- 
 derstand to be meant what is usually called the fruit 
 of the strawberry, (the receptacle containing the 
 seed,) and n ot the seed itself, which is the real fruit. 
 Leaving the fact, or otherwise, of this in the case of 
 the stra wberry, analogy would seem to settle it as nei- 
 ther imposs-ibleoriniprobable. TbeMaclura,adiceciou8 
 plant, produces the osage orange apple, or receptacle 
 con taining imperfect seed, many miles away from any 
 staminate influence, and as Dame Nature is usually 
 a consistent old lady, what she docs once she may do 
 again . 

Neither will it be denied that the strawberry plant, 
 in its normal condition, has perfect flowers, and there 
 are very mitny analagous cases, of plants under a 
 change of circumstances, reverting back to, or vary- 
 ing from their original character. This is no new 
 fact in vegetable Physiology. 

But when the very foremost champion of the fixed 
 sexuality of the strawberry plant, voluntarily comes 
 forward over his own signature, and gives up the 
 ipliole case, and <d his own aecmd knocks away every 
 prop of the platform on which be and his friends 
 have been contending, there is surely no use in fur- 
 ther discussion in the Farm Journal or any where 
 else. 

N. Longworth, in a late number of the Western 
 Horticultural Review, concludes an article as follows: 
 "A; Longworth's Prolific (which is hermaphrodite) 
 produces a ch.anee pistillate blossom, I see no reason 
 for saying that there may not be a pistillate bearing 
 an occasional hermaphrodite or staminate blos.som." 
 This admission covers the whole ground, and is ex- 
 actly whatT. Meehan has been assailed for asserting. 
 One remark further, in conclusion, which simple jus- 
 tice to him seems to require. It is insinuated, and 
 indeed directly asserted, that he had seen the article 
 by W.D. before penning his own, and had copied the 
 ideas from it. On the contrary, being accidentally 
 on a visit to West Chester, he informed us that ho 
 had forwarded his article to the Horticulturist, and 
 th is was before the i.ssue of the number of the Farm 
 Journal containing W. D.'s essay. That their views 
 should have been identical, is no more strange than 
 that the views of scientific men should happen to 
 ag rec on a scientific qucstiim when they are 2000 
 miles apart, and had never met.
