from wliicli this fluid had dr lined, were, at the same 
 time, 80 dried up and heated, fur want of moisture, 
 that they were upon the inside, burnt to a wliite 
 powder, or aJics. The ammonia, and even the or- 
 }i;anic matter, had been evaporated or consumed in 
 the intense combustion that had talicn phvco, and all 
 for want of the very drainaj;p in which the ducks 
 were fishing fur worms. 

Now if farmers will practice no other book-farm- 
 ing, it seems to me that they cannot bo afraid to a- 
 dopt a few simple and reasonable rules for the prop- 
 er preservation of manure, and the increase of the 
 heap, to say nothing of making manure by artificial 
 means. With this view, I will note down a few plain 
 tiirectiuns for saving niJinure. 

1st. — Xevcr lot manure be spread over a large sur- 
 face of ground, unless it be covered with clay, or 
 muck. It is much b etter to scrape up the contents 
 of the barn-yard, frequently, and put the manure 
 irto a heap, than to let it lie spread out, and exposed 
 to sun, air, rain, .and wind. If the yard is small, 
 and a deep layer of mu ik, clay or coarse material 
 bo thrown in, for the cattle to walk over, and to ab- 
 .sorb liquids, it may answer; but even then, unless 
 the whole yard he covered by a shed, it would be 
 better to throw the manure into a pile 

2nd. — When stable manure is phaced in a heap, to 
 remain any great length of time, there should al- 
 M-ays be layers of clay, or old black l.iam, or ch.ar- 
 coal, placed between layers of manure, to keep the 
 manure from heating too much, and to absorb thegas- 
 es generatfd by the infallible decomposition, orrot- 
 tcning that must ensue. The top of the heap 
 should also bo covered with loam or clay. 

3rd. — The manure heap should bo kept con.stantly 
 moist, or wet, at all seasons, but never so wet as to 
 show dra nage; or if it should drain, the fluids which 
 pass off should be caught in a hogshead or cistern, 
 and thrown biokupon tlio heap. A cistern and 
 chain pump, placed near the heap, upon the lowest 
 hole, will enable the farmer tn pump back the drain- 
 ngo as fjist as it appears. 

•4th. — The manure heap should be covered, so as 
 not to bo affected by sun, wind or rain. If too dry, 
 ■water should be added to it. 

5th, — If the heap heats too much, or smokes, .and 
 shows that ammonia is evaporating, throw upon the 
 heap a barrel of water, into which you have put one 
 quart of oil of vitrei. This will chock the too rapid 
 decomposition, reduce the heat, and prevent the es- 
 cape of ammonia. The vitrol is worth its cost, as a 
 manure, independent of any other effect. 

6th. — If the heap does not heat suiBciently, and 
 much of the material is coarse, and requires rotting 
 to make it tit for use, (especially in cold weather) 
 make several holes in the heap, with a stake, and 
 pour in some hot lye, or hot potash water, (strong) 

I a nd you will soon have a fine heat. You will not be 
 likely to use too much. 
 7th. If your manure smokes when you are moving it, 
 you may stop the smoke, and prevent the loss of 
 much valuable material (ammonia or hartshore.) by 
 wetting the heap with oil of vitriol and water, .--ay 
 one quart to a barrel of water. Or, you may turn 
 the heap a few days before using it, and sprinkle in 
 a quantity of Plaster of Paris, which is Sulphate of 
 Lime, or Oil of Vitrol and Lime. 

8th. Oreen weeds, ifee., are best rotted in acompost 
 heap, with clay or loam, instead of in the bog pen. 
 Much valuable material is lost hy exposing green 
 vegetable matter in an open hog pen. If you add 
 one bushel of salt to every fiur horse loads of 
 weeds, you will kill the seeds, and prevent the ma- 
 nure from making the land foul. The salt should be 
 added after the weeds are well rotted, not when they 
 are first put into the heap. 

This much for m aking and saving manure by plain 
 ■and simple moans, adapted to the use of plain farm- 
 ers. In another article I may present some methods 
 of making man ores of coarse and cheap materials, 
 by artificial means, which are considered by scien- 
 tific farmers worth knowing. I made eight hundred 
 horse loads last year, on a very barren farm, in New 
 Jersey, where' probably not raor:; than fifty loads had 
 ever been made before. I kept only two horses in 
 my stable, and four cows which were not tied up, be- 
 cause there were no accommodations for them.

Right ISducatiou of Horses. 

That Horses may be educated will not appear 
 strange to those who have closely observed the iutel- . J 
 ligfnce often manifested by thatiroblc animal. ■■ 

Thu present remarks are designed to give some in 
 formation in relation to the rearing and treatment of 
 j'oung horses, not so much, however, with reference 
 to their food and drink, as to their quietness and do- 
 cility. 

That there is a difference in ihe temp.r and dispo- 
 sition of dilferent horses, is not denied: but at the 
 same time it is averred that where a horse is so vici- 
 ous or unmanageable as to render him unsafe in the 
 harness, it is chargealile in aliH:is( every iniiance to 
 tlie treatment lie has formerly received. 

Training of colts shouhi commence when tliey are 
 about three months old, so as t.i have them become 
 familiar with the family before they arc taken from 
 the dam. Some colts are inclined to use their heels 
 rather too freely; in such cases great care is niees- 
 s.ary. They should be approached carefully, and 
 caressed and curried, and they will soon submit to 
 have their feet taken up and handled witiiout resist- , 
 ance; and this will aid in quieting them while being 
 shod, as the horse seldom torgets what ho baa unco 
 learned. 

A common method of weaning colts is to take 
 them to some back lot, an 1 place a heavy yoke or 
 "poke" on the neck, which they are compelled to 
 wear for several weeks until their spirits are com- 
 pletely broken, and become more or less 'ewc-nccked', 
 from which defect they rarely recover. Another
