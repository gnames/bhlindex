four inches apart in the rows, aad from three to four 
 in depth. It makes a very pretty bed if crocuses and 
 8U0VV drops are planted around the bed, next to the 
 edging, hyacinths next, and tulipj in the centre. On 
 the approach of hard weather the bed should be cov- 
 ered with several inchc-i of leaves. Mow grass plats. 
 After they are cleared they would bo much improved 
 by being Well rolled; treated in this w.iy thoy Would 
 look well the remainder of the season. 

Faru. — Rye should be sown in this month, so as 
 to become well established before Winter. Potato 
 ground should be cleared as early as practicable, 
 for this crop or lat3 wheat. An after top dressing 
 of short manure or super phosphate of lime may be 
 applied, to avoid the delay of hauliug manure frop? 
 the barn yard. Use plenty of gras.s seed, not less 
 than five quarts of timothy, to be followed by clover 
 in the spring. In husking corn, stleot the largest 
 and best ears for seed, and particularly where there 
 are two on a stalk. Continued care in this respect 
 for a few years will be well repaid. Corn for seed 
 should be laid away on a shelf by itself, or suspended 
 by the husks from the rafters, secure from mice. 

Corn in the crib is apt to heat if either husked too 
 soon, before being well cured in the shock, or not 
 properly culled. The sound corn should first be gath- 
 ered from the heaps, and tlio cuUings afterwards 
 placed by themselves tor fall feoiiing to the stook. 
 The economy of feeding all the nubbins or uuripocorn 
 to the fattening hogs is rather dubious, where the ob- 
 ject is to prepare them early fur the butcher. Sound 
 corn, in the ear, previously subjected to the boiling or 
 steeping process, in a farmer's portable boiler, would 
 be found more profitable. Every farmer should have 
 one of these about his premises, which can be set 
 wherever most convenient, and should be used for 
 corn, small potatoes, beets, &c. The real value of 
 these for stock is only developed bv boiling, and at 
 this season of the year, when refuse vegetables are 
 so abundant, the expense would bo twice paid before 
 Christmas. The profit of cooked over uncooked food 
 is no longer an open question. 

If there is leisure, plough up.this fall, corn ground 
 for next season. Sink the plough up to the beam, 
 and follow with the sub-soil. A cheap vrny to get a 
 new farm every year is to plough a little deeper. On 
 many farms the sub-soil has not been disturbed for a 
 century, and when turned up to the meliorating in- 
 fluence of the atmosphere, will be found often to ts 
 abounding in inorganic or mineral wealth, and capa- 
 ble of assimilation by the growing crops. The earth 
 taken out from the bottom of a dopp well and spread 
 on the surface, is an illustration of the immense loss 
 from shallow ploughing. Every farmer, almost, has 
 observed the benefit of such an application. 

Horses and oxen are generally in better order for 
 hard work now, than in the spring. 

At leisure times collect leaves, soil from headlands, 

coarse grass, &c., and place convenient tjbarn yarda 
 for use during winter.
