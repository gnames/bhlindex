PRUNING AND MANAGEMENT OF FRUIT TREES, 

[November, 

Pruning and management of l''rult Trees. 

It seem8 almost iucredible the ignorance prevailing 
 among intoUigent persons on the above ?ubjocf. wo 
 mean not only farmers, but citizens who have room 
 in their city garjons for a few trees, as VToll as those 
 hating a few acres out of town, and who miijht keep 
 themselves amply provided through the season, with 
 a sieccessicm of the most luscious fruits, pears, plumsi 
 (barri .g the curoulio,) chcn-ies, apple?, peaches, &c' 
 It would surrpise many how li//le attention is neces- 
 sary, provided it is given seasonabbj, and with jiuly' 
 ment. The merchant engaged in the city during the 
 day, and who drives or rides on the railroad in the 
 afternoon to his pleasant subm-ban residence, could 
 find no more agreeable and useful employment, than 
 half an hour or an hour's attention in this way daily. 
 Here a too luxuriant branch requires shortening, a 
 terminal bud pinched off, a useless shoot removed. 
 There, the bark indicates sluggish action, and should 
 be softened and cleaned, by the wash for this pur- 
 pose. One tree lias the grass growing too close a- 
 round it, and which should be dug nnder. Another 
 has a superabundance of fruit which requires thin- 
 ning. Mulching around all of thenj must be appli- 
 ed, &c. To do all this does not require so much 
 time as taste for such pursuits in the first place, and 
 then a little knowledge and skill. One of our friends, 
 a very intellignnt merchant in Philadelphia, but who 
 spends the Summer at his country seat, was com- 
 plaining to us lately of his peach trees, that they 
 would not bear, ivere in fine healthy condition, 
 growing most luxuriantly, and making vigorous 
 shoots every season, but still there was no fruit. 
 His theory was, that the tree exhausted itself, by 
 such great efforts at groioing, and bad not strength 
 left to produce fruit, and h ; was accordingly about to 
 dig in around the trees, a copious supply of stable 
 manure, to recruit these exhausted energies. Here 
 was a ease of what might be called, false reasoning 
 from facts. The trees did not bear fruit, L-ecause 
 their strength ivas given to make growth of wood 
 Check this by the shortening in process, or by root 
 pruning impede the circulation of sap and you develop 
 fruit buds, and have fruit. Our friend's plan was to 
 promote still further the luxuriant growth, increase 
 the very cause of failure. The trees dont bear be- 
 cause they grow so fast. We will give them manure, 
 and make them grow faster, and then wo shall have 
 peaches. We mention this as a case in point, and 
 there aa-e hundreds of others like it. AVe have often 
 urged in our Journal, that Fruit Culture is a business 
 in itself, and like all others, requires to be nmierstood 
 before success should be expected. It is both a sci- 
 ence and a art. We must not cram a tree down into a 
 small hole, and expect dame nature will supply us 
 with juicy Bartletts, and other fruits, without our 
 giving her any further thought or assistance. No; 
 she stands u]-on her reserved "rights," and wont be 

slighted. We must study the habits of trees, the 
 laws of vegetable growth, the subject of specific ma- 
 nures, and then we shall have the reward of our 
 labour, with all that additional zest which accompan- 
 ies intelligent effort. Our tables will then be sup- 
 plied, botli in quantity and quality, with just such 
 fruit, each in its season as our imaginations only 
 have hitherto been yeas/i;!(7 upon. 

We extract below a most excellent chapter on the 
 principles and practice of pruning, from P. Barry's 
 Fruit Book, the best Work we think on the rearing 
 and management of fruit trees, yet published in this 
 connti-y. Every owner of a spot of ground largo 
 enough for a few fruit trees, should have a copy. It; 
 may be obtained at the Agricultaral Warehouse in 
 this borough. Price, f 1 25. 

PRUNINGâ€” ITS PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE, 

This is one of the most important operations con- 
 nected with the management of trees. From the re- 
 moval of the seedling plant from the seed bed, through 
 all its successive stages of growth and maturity, 
 pruning, to some extent, and for some purpose, ia 
 necess;iry. It may, therefore, be reasonably presum- 
 ed, that no one is capable of managing trees success- 
 fully, and cspiecially those conducted under certain 
 forms, more or less opposed to nature, without know- 
 ing well how to prune, what to prime, attd when to 
 prune. This knowledge can onlyte acquired by a care- 
 ful study of the structure of trees, because the pru- 
 ning apjjiied to a tree must (aside from the general 
 principles on which all pruning depends) be adapted 
 to its particular habits of growSh and mode ef bear- 
 ing its fruit. It is in view of this fact that the chapter 
 on the structure and mode of formation of the differ- 
 ent parts of fruit trees has teen given in the first 
 part of this treatise, that it may form the basis of 
 this branch of culture. 

The idea that our bright American sun and clear 
 atmosphere renders pruning an almost unnecessary 
 operation, has not only been inculcated by horticul- 
 tural writers, but has been acted upon in practice to 
 such an extent that more than three-fourths of all the 
 bearing fruit trees in the country,at this moraent,are 
 either lean, misshaped skeletons, or the heads are per- 
 fect masses of wood, unable to yield more than one 
 bushel of fruit in ten, well matured, colored, and 
 ripened. 

This is actually the case even in what may be call- 
 ed, in comparison, well managed orchards. Look at 
 the difference between the fruits producsed on young 
 and old trees. 

The former arc open, the fruits are exposed to the 
 sun, and, therefore, they are large and perfect, their 
 skins smooth and brilliant.as though they were painted 
 and polished. This ought to teach us something a- 
 bout pruning; but this is only one point. We prune 
 one portion of a tree to reduce its vigor, and to fa- 
 vor the growth of anotherand weaker part. We prune 
 a stem, a branch, or a shoot to prwlace ramifications 
 of these parts, and thus change or modify the form 
 of the whole tree. We prune to induce fruitfulness, 
 and to diminish it. We prune in the growing as 
 well as in the dormant season; and finally, we prune 
 both roots and branches. Thus we see that pruning 
 is applied to all parts of the tree, at all seasons, and 
 to produce the most opposite results.
