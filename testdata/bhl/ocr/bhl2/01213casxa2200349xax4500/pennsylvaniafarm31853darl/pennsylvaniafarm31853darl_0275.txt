PRUNING AND MANAGEMENT OF FRUIT TREES.

It appears necessary to treat of pruning under 
 each of these circumstances separately. 

1st. Pniiiing to Direct the Gmiclh from one part 
 of a tree to another. — The first period in the exis- 
 tence and growth of a tree in which this becomes 
 necessary, is in the nursery. Tliose win) have had 
 any experience in tree culture, have oltserved that 
 young trees in nursery rows have a tendency to in- 
 crease in diameter. la certain cases, this want of 
 proportion becomes so great, that the tree bends un- 
 der its own weight: and hence, it is necessary to re- 
 sort to some method of propping it up. This con- 
 dition is attributable to several causes. First, the 
 absence of a sufficient amount of air and light around 
 the stem, to enable the leaves on it to fulfill their 
 functions properly. It has been shown that the for- 
 mation of new wood depends upon the elaborating 
 process carried on in the leaves, and that this pr()- 
 eess can be maintained only in a free exposure to the 
 sun and air. This being the case, it is obvious that 
 any part of tlie ti-ee excluded from the action oi these 
 agents, cannot keep pace in growth with other parts 
 to which they have full access. In nursery rows, as 
 trees are usually planted, the stems, after the first 
 year's growth, are to a great extent, excluded from 
 the light, consequently the buds and leaves on them 
 cannot perform their parts in the creation of new 
 wood. The top of the tree, however, is fully expos- 
 ed, and, consequently, it makes a rapid growth tow- 
 ards the free air and light- When this is continued for 
 two or three years in succession, the tree becomes 
 top-heavy; the quantity of woody fibre at the top is 
 as great as, and it may be greater than, at the botr 
 torn; and hence it bends under its own weight 

2d. The leadenci/ of the Sap te the Growing Points 
 at the Top of th-e Tree. — Growth is always the most 
 active and vigorous, when trees are in a natural con- 
 dition, at the newly-formed parts. The young buds 
 are the most excitable, and the more direct their com- 
 munication with the roots, the more rapid will be 
 their growth. Hence it is that a yearling tree fur- 
 nished with fifteen to twenty buds or more, from its 
 base to its top, frequently produces a shoot from its 
 terminal bud only, and seldom more than three or 
 four shoots from the whole number of buds, and 
 these at the top. This natural tendency, and the 
 exclusion of light from the stems of nursery trees, 
 by their closeness to one another, arc the chief caus- 
 es of weak and crooked trees, to counteract which 
 we resort to pruning. 

In "heading down" a young tree, we cutaway one- 
 third or one-half of the stem, and this removes the 
 actively growing parts; the sap must then find new 
 channels. Its whole force is directed to the buds 
 that were before dormant, they are excited inti 
 growth, and produce new wood and leaves; these send 
 down ncT layers of woody fibre on the old stem, aod 
 it increases rapidly in diameter, bo that by the time 
 it has attained its former height, the base is two or 
 three times as thick as the top, and possesses suffici-, 
 ent strength to maintain an erect position. 

Maiiitaininij an erpial growth among the branches of 
 a tree, it conducted on the same principle. Branches 
 that are more favorably placed than others, apprcj- 
 priate more than their due propor Jon of the sap, 
 and grow too vigorously, are checked, by removing 
 more or less of their growing points; this lessons the 
 flow of sap to that point, and it naturally takes its 
 course to the growing parts of the weaker branches 
 that were left entire, and thus a balance is restored. 

Pruning to Renew the Growth of Stunted Trees. — 
 It frequently happens that trees, from certain caus- 

es, become stunted, and almost cease to grow; the 
 sap vessels become contracted, and every part as- 
 sumes a comparatively dormant conditon. In such 
 cases they are cut back, the number of their bud.s 
 and leaves is reduced, the whole force (jf the sap is 
 made to act up.jn the sm ill numljjr remaining, and 
 enables them to produce vigorous young shoots; these 
 send down new woody matter to the stem, new roots 
 are also formed, and thus the whole tree is renewed 
 and invigorated. 

Pruning to Induce Fruilfulness. — This is conduct- 
 ed on the principle that whatever is favorable to rap- 
 id, vigorous growth, is unfavorable to the immedi- 
 ate productiiin of fruit. Il-jnce the object in view 
 must be to check growth and inipads the circulation 
 of the sap, just the opposite of pruning to renew 
 growth. The only period at which this pruning can 
 be performed, is alter vegjtatiou has commenced. 
 If a tree is severely pruned immediately after it has 
 put forth its leaves, it receives such a check as to be 
 unable to produce a vigorous growth the same season: 
 the sap is impeded in its circulation, and the result 
 is th it a large number of sho its dia*, would have made 
 vigorous wood branches, had they not been checked, 
 assume the character of fruit spurs and brauchcs. 
 Pinching is the principal mode of pruning to pro- 
 mote fruitfulness, and will be explained hereafter. 
 It depends upon the above principle, of impeding the 
 circulation of the sap and checking growth. 

Pruning to diminish fruilfulness, is conducted on 
 the same principle as that to renew growth, for this, 
 in fact, is the object. 

Pruning the Roots.. — This is practised as well to 
 promote fruitfulness, as to lessen the dimensions of 
 trees. The roots, as has been shown, are the organs 
 that absorb from the ground the principal food ot the 
 tree, and in proportion to their number, size, and iic- 
 tivity, other things being equal, are the vigor and 
 growth of the stem and b:-anches. Hence when a 
 tree is deprived of a certain portion of its roots, its 
 supply of food from the soil is lessened, growth is 
 checked, the sap moves slowly in its channels, is bet- 
 ter elaborated in the leaves, and the young branches 
 and buds begin to assume a fruitful character. 

Roots are also pruned to prevent them from pene- 
 trating too deeply into the earth, and induce the for- 
 mation of lateral roots near the surface, similar to 
 the cutting back of a stem to produce lateral branch- 
 es; the principle is the same. 

Pruning at the time of Transplanting. — This is 
 performed, not only to remove bruised and broken roots 
 and branches; but to restore the tree to a proper bal- 
 ance. As trees are ordinarily taken from the ground; 
 the roots are bruised; broke nor inutilated,to a great- 
 er or less extent. This obviou ly destroys I he natur- 
 al balance or proportion that exi.«ted between the 
 roots and stem, and in such a conditicm the tree is 
 unable to grow. The demand upon the roots must 
 therefore be lessened, by reducing the stem and 
 branches in length or number, or both: and the more 
 the roots have suffered, the greater must be the re- 
 duction of the stem and branches, to bring them to 
 a corresponding condition. 

Pi-iKs. — Why don't all the farmers raise pears? — 
 Good pears bring a higher price in this market thau 
 any other fruit. Choice liartlett's have been s(dd 
 hero at 12^ cimts each, and a few of another kind at 
 li<l cents each. At such prices whoever could raise 
 a crop of them would make his fortune speedily. —
