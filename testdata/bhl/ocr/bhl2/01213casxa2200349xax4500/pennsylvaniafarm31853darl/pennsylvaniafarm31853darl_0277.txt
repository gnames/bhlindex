Curled Leaf iu tlie Peach. 

Tliid disease, if so we may eall it, has been, foi- 
 four or live years past, assuming a more and more 
 scriiius aspect, so tliat cultivatiirs around us liere in 
 Western N. Y., l)e;^iu to say that if it goes on as it 
 tlirealens to dr, and no remedy he discovered, we 
 sliall soon he conipuUed to al)andon peach culture 
 entirely. Tliis would certainly bo great calamity, 
 and it becomes every one who wishes to escape, to 
 investif^ate carefully the nature of the disease, with 
 a view to the discovery of the real cause. We have 
 been lookinji; anxiously for some new li^ht on the 
 subject among the journals of the day. and find the 
 following in a receut number of the Counlrij Gentle^ 
 man. 

"The curl in the loaf of the peach, which is gen- 
 erally supposed to have had a very unfavorible in- 
 fluence on the young crop, has given rise to much 
 speculation as to its immediate cause, and cidd weath- 
 er, aphides, fungus, or mildew, and diseased sap, 
 have been variously assigned as reasons. The cold 
 weather theory will not always apply, as the disease 
 sometimes appears after a continued succession of 
 warm days, and the tirstopeningof the young leaves 
 shows the symptoms when ever they have been e.x- 
 posed to a cool night. Agi^in, the disease has often 
 made its appearance when no aphides could at any 
 time be detected with the most powerful achromatic 
 glass; and newly opening leaves, exposed only a few- 
 hours to the fresh air, and on which no insect had 
 ever set foot, have shown incipient, but unmistak- 
 able indications. The explanation by 'diseased sap,' 
 is too general and indefinite — the fungus theory has 
 more appearance ol plausil. ility, but needs investi- 
 gatio 1 and proof — aiid if correct, the fungus must 

grow 
 jleaf 

idennis of the leaf is quite unbroken when the curl 
 first appears in the cellular tissue. 

But whatever may be the cause, the best remedy, 
 80 far as discovered, is vigorous growth. We have 
 observed trees standing in the corner of a hog yard, 
 where they were copiously supplied with manure, 
 and as a consequence making a rapid growth, cover- 
 ed with a deep green fuliage, with scarcely a vestige 
 of the curl; and a row of peach trees which had been 
 very freely shortened in the past winter, by cutting 
 off branches in some cases an inch in diameter, have 
 S'nt (mt strong new shoots, almost wholly free from 
 the disease, and the trees are well loaded with young 
 fruit." 

Now, our opinion, formed several years ago, and 
 strengthened by later experience, is that the curl is 
 pruducod by changes of temperature too great for 
 the delicate constitution of the peach. It is n tree 
 that vegotatos early, and being usually and fnmi ne- 
 cessity planted in a light soil, its earlinoss is hasten- 
 ed, and the sap gets into active oireulation, and 
 young leaves arc put forth long bofor^ the weather 
 in our northern climate becomes steadily warm. We 
 all know how common it i.s to have warm genial 
 spring weather about the opening of the buds, when 
 a sudilL'n change cornea, and we have probably a 
 ■week or two of c Id, rainy weathor, with slight 
 frosts probably, with cold dry winds. This at once 
 arrests the development of the young shoots and 
 loaves; the sap b iconics stagnant and disoasiMJ; the 
 birk is ruptured, ami gum oozes nut all over the 
 younger part*; the leaves, ft'hether in an embryo 
 ooniiilion, rolled up in the bud, in- half or wholly ex- 
 pmded, bee nil ,• swollen and diseased; then jnildew 
 attacks them, as it is always ready to reign upon 
 sickly or feeble vegetation, and wiih this apliidos and 

other insects; henco ths opinions that mildew or in- 
 sects were the cause of the disease. 

18-1'J, we think, was the first year this disease ap- 
 peared in Western Now York, in a serious form, 
 That spring was cold and changable. 1850 was sim- 
 ilar, and the curl was worsj than before, and so has 
 continued since. One stron; argument, at least si) 
 we regard it, in fivor of this view, is the fact that if 
 wo have fine weather at the opening of the peach 
 buds, we have very little curl, and that immediately 
 after a change to cold the curl appears, and its se- 
 verity is always in proportiim to the intensity and 
 continuance of .he cold. Then again, as soon as the 
 weather becomes warm and steady, the diseased 
 leaves drop and new healthy leaves appear, and the 
 disease is no more soon that season, not a symptom 
 of it. Besides, some varieties are much less affect- 
 ! ed by it than others. We have a very hardy French 
 [ variety, Pecha do Vignos, that scarcely ever shows a 
 I curl in the worst seasons. We have a short row of 
 six trees that have come almost hourly under our 
 ' observation; the varieties are the Snow, Old Mixon 
 Free, La Grange, Crawford's Early, Hains' Early, 
 j and Cuoledgo's Favorite. These were all planted at 
 ] one time, of the same age, and in the same soil, and 
 I have been treated exactly alike, but the Crawford's 
 ■ Early and Coolodgc's Favorite have suffered so much 
 ; less than the others from the curl, that the trees are 
 nearly twice as large, and both have now a good crop 
 ; of fruit on, while the others have few or none. In 
 j going through an e.xtonsive orchard we might find 
 I many instances of this kind. 

I In additiim to this, we fi d that trees in sheltered 
 gardens suffer less that those exposed; and under 
 glass, there is no such thing as curl. Are not all 
 these facts sufficient to warrant the opinion we havo 
 expressed ? 

The article we have quoted says, "the disease 
 sometimes occurs after a succession of vv-arm days." 
 We admit this, but it never has appeared to our 
 knowledge after warm days without tlie intervention 
 of cold niglits. Has anyone seen it appear in warm 
 weather, say in .June, July, or subsequent months? 

It says, too, that "the first opening of the young 
 leaves show the sympt.ims when they have nevef 
 been exposed even to a cold night." We grant this, 
 but as we havo said, the sudden and violent check 
 given to the tree affects every part, and the leaves 
 even while rolled up in the bud. Neither can wo a- 
 gree with the opinion that "vigorous growth is the) 
 best remedy," for we have seen some of the most 
 vigorous growing trees suffer most seriiuisly. Wo 
 regard iCfll ripsiicd wood as more important than vig- 
 orous growth, but we would combine thesR if we 
 could. Were not t!ie trees quoted as exain|ilos ben- 
 ehted by so.iie kinil of protectionV To avoid in sumo 
 degree the c.f ;i;ti of th J luila ly w-: can now only 
 suggest the seleeiioii of /( irdjl varieties and planting 
 in situations somewhat protected from the cold west 
 and north-west winds. Will peach growers who 
 have had opportunity for extensive observation giva 
 us the benelit of their oxp 'rienco on this subject/ 
 If we have drawn erroneous conclusions from our 
 own observations wo shall he th inkful to any onO 
 who will set us right. — Ojiie^^ce Farmv.
