their crops are diminishing, think only of extending 
 their area, by adding acres of surface, as if they sup- 
 posed tliei" title deeds onlj' gave them a right to six 
 inches deep of earth. If they will take those deeds, 
 study their meaning, and ap])ly the lesson to their 
 fields, they will soon realise in three-fold crops the 
 fact that the law has given them three farms where 
 they supposed they had but one — in other words, that 
 the subsoil brought up and combined with the top 
 soil, and enriched with the atmospheric influences ; 
 and those other elements which agricultural science 
 will tetch them to apply to their ground, will 
 incrsase three fold, the measures of their productive- 
 ness. To show to what extent the fertility of the 
 soil can be increased I reier to a statement in the 
 last Patent Office Report. In the year 1S50 there 
 vrere nine competitors for the premium corn crop of 
 Kentucky, each of whom cultivated ten acre.s. Their 
 average crop was one hundred and twenty two bush- 
 els to the acre. At this time the average crop of 
 wheat per acre in the harvests of Great Britain, on a 
 soil cultivated for centuries is about double that pro- j 
 duction on the virgin soil of Ohio. — Why is this? 
 Simply because Britishfarraers are educated men and ( 

apply their work wisely. They pay back to the earth 
 what they borrow; t.iey endeavor by every means in 
 their power, to enrich their ground, and in retnrn it 
 enriches them. If our farmers instead of laboring to 
 double their acres would endeavor to double their 
 crops they would find it a rast saving of time and 
 toil, and an increase of profits. 

Many of them never think of digging ten inches 
 into the soil, unless they have dreamed about a crock 
 of gold hid in the earth: but if they wcmld set about 
 the work of digging in earnest, every man would find 
 his crock of of gold, without the aid of dreams and 
 divination. 

We have great advantage over the British farmers 
 in the fact that nearly all our farmers hold the land 
 they cultivate in fee simple, while in England they 
 are chiefly tenants, hiring the land of nobility paying 
 enormous rents to the proprietors besides heavy 
 taxes to government. Taxes here are comparatively 
 light, and our farmers are their own landlords. Hence 
 they have been able to pay three fold wages for labor 
 in proportion of those paid in Europe, pay the cost 
 of transportation and yet undersell the British far- 
 mers in their own market.

 Hartford, Cimn., when thepatcntwas granted to him

The nature of the invention consists in construct_ 

ing two rubbers, which are secured on arms suspend- 
 ed from two standards; one of the rubbers is secured 
 to the lower end of one arm, while the other is sus- 
 pended to a similar arm secured to the main one, by 
 a hinge, which allows the rubbers to be drawn to- 
 gether or forced apart by the operator, at pleasure. 
 The rubbers spoken of, act so as to rub the cloth, to be 
 washed, between them and fluted wash-boards placed 
 under them, one of which is stationary and the other
