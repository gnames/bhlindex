ricida of tlioir gruvrtli, !is will bo slioiMi hereafter 
 when the subject (if feeiiin;; and fattening is taken 
 into consideration. Seeing tliut the bony strueture, 
 gelatinous substances, and muscles are the jjart.^t of 
 the anininl which earliest arrive at their full devel- 
 opment, it follows that, other thini^s being eciual, 
 those breeds which arrive at their full growth in the 
 shortest period will be the kinds naturally adapted to 
 secrete a superabuiidanee of fat amounting toUiseasc 
 (but vvhieh is the farmer's profit) in the shortest pe- 
 riod from the time of birth, and consequently least 
 e.xpenditure of food, presuming animals of difl'erent 
 breeds I ut of like age eat like quantities. Carrying 
 this comparisim a step further, viz., that if two ani- 
 mals so treated and kilh^d at the same age — say at 
 nine or ten months— were to be found when dressed 
 to weigh alike; but the on.! animal, siy an improved 
 Esse."!, and the other an old English pig, their mar- 
 ketable value would be very different, fully 20 per 
 cent. The first would present a fine, thick coating of 
 firm fat embedded in the cellular tissue, the ham 
 Would present the Epicurean quality of marbled flesli, 
 with a due amount of external fat, and the omentum 
 would yield a fine leaf of wdiite lard; the roasting- 
 pieces, if cut out for that purpose, such as the mus- 
 cle running fnun the neck down to the loin, and in- 
 eluding the joints commonly culled the sparerib and 
 loin, will be found tender, juic}", and fat. Another 
 great advantage of this breed is, that in pro[)ortion 
 to its size the weiiiht of the One joints and pieces, 
 such as the ham, shoulder, ami belly, where the de- 
 sirable intermi.'cture of lean and fat, so much covet- 
 ed by epicures, is to be found, is much greater rela- 
 tively to the whcde carcase than will be found in the 
 larger breed. On e-"famining the carcase of the larger 
 breed the enveloping fat will be found of a light grey 
 cohmr, soft, and riabby: the muscles stringy, and 
 when salted will run upgreatly, yielding at the same 
 time a large quantity of brine; so much so, that when 
 dry tin wliule weight will be lound to have diminish 
 ed in a much greaterproporlion than thesame weiglit 
 of pork from the smaller breed. To say nothing of 
 the greater weight of b.ine in the latter than in the 
 former kind, in co<jking, the meat from the first will 
 be found to scarcely diminish in size, whilst the sec- 
 ond will he seen to shrivel up considerably. This 
 will be especially seen in the belly parts. The cause 
 of this dift'erence is, that in the nnitured animal the 
 cellular tissue, ligamenis, &a., have fully developed 
 tbinnsdves — have liecume firm and com[iact; while- 
 in the growing animal these portions of the body re- 
 main in a softer and more gelatinous state, in conse- 
 quence of the presence uf moisture. It will be seen 
 that this form of tis>;ueis almost indispcns.ib e to the 
 growing animal, in order to adapt it to its constant- 
 ly increasing expansiiin of frame. AV'hen arrived at 
 its full growth, this softness gives place to firmness 
 and conipaetness of texture. A hss ani<innt of wat r 
 is now luund in the tissues, and the flaceidiiy of 
 youth is succeeded by the cdasticity of adolescence— 
 the compactness and' strength of liiaturity being fol- 
 lowed by the rigidity of age. The off cts arising 
 from cooking and sailing m mU in th^i forms presup- 
 posed arc in uniscm with the above faints : in me.ats 
 salted or cooked, derived fnun the immature animal, 
 the gelatine is dissolved out of the tissue, and the 
 animal fibre contracts, which, combined with the cir- 
 cumstance <d' the tissues bearing so much l.irger a 
 ratio to the fatty and muscular pirts, eaiiso the m at 
 to cont:-aer and shrivel up, whilst tlio disproporlimi of 
 sinewy substance to the whole mass makes the meat 
 hard and tough; in maturity, the tissue are capable 

in b liling of absorbing m listurc and becoming sof- 
 tened; this kindol meat has consequently the ten- 
 derness so desirable. Although of two animalstreat- 
 ed as described, the profit decidedly preponderates in 
 favor of the sm.iller breed, it by no means follows if 
 the experiment be carried further, — that is, until the 
 larger breed has arrived at maturity, that the profit 
 W(ruld not be with the larger animals; so afti'r the 
 smaller breed has arrived at a certainamount of obe- 
 sity, it won d m ^rcdy become a C(msuu(er of food 
 without any commensurate advantage: on the other 
 hand, the larger animal would bo constantly ilevel- 
 oping its frame; and wlien fully matured, I have my 
 dimbts whether any animal yields so large a return 
 of meat for the quantity of food consumed as .si^'ected 
 mature animals of the old Etiglish breed. In this 
 respect the imimjved Berkshire bears an intermedi- 
 ate place between the sra tiler ami the larger breed, 
 arriving at maturity earlier; but I doubt, when fully 
 grown; whether it puts on the same quantity of flesh 
 for an equal amount of food, and in as short a time 
 as the old l-arge breed at maturity. Of the three 
 breeds now named f.>y way of illustration, my own 
 experience leads me to decide that for all purposes, 
 whether as fresh pork, pickled pork, ham and bacon, 
 the merits of the improved Essex exceeds all other 
 kinds; that the improved Berkshire follows; whilst 
 the (dd largo kir.d is a mere bacon pig : as suidi, how- 
 ever, it is highly esteemed in the farm-hdnse; the 
 huge flitch, wiih its great depth of fat, being consid- 
 ered the most eeonomic food for labourers — in which 
 opinion tlie h.bourer will be found to concur, as 
 whenever he has n choice, or from circumstances is 
 compelled to purchase for himselt, he will always be 
 found to prefer the thick fat part of the flitch. 

In choosing a breed of pigs which is intended to 
 be sold to pirties who follow the business of baccm 
 curing, the size of the breed will be greatly det(!r- 
 niined '.,y tlie market in wdiieh they arc to be dis- 
 posed of. Very large fat bacon is principally re- 
 (juired for tlie mining distric s of AVarwickshire, the 
 I'otteries, and the nianufaeturing districts of Lan- 
 cashii oand Yorkshire. "Middles" are also si'iit from 
 Lonilon and Liverpool to the agricultural counties. 
 Uenerally speaking, large sized bacon is the favourite 
 kind amongst hirmers. The olijecticmable feature in 
 the larger breeds is the length of time they require 
 before arriving at matiiri y; -whilst growing, they 
 doubtless increase in size at a small expense of food, 
 and will eat matter that will be refused by fattening 
 pigs, and in this respect, perhaps, they are the mo.st 
 valuable animals of a:iy, that is, to fare by chance. 
 If, however, they have to be maintained im food 
 whie has to be specially provi<led. I cannot think 
 they will yield an equal (pianti y of meat, when fat- 
 tened and killed at frmu 18 months to 2 y arsoUl, as 
 would be formi'd were the same amount of luod given 
 to the I'^.ssex breeil, killeil at Ironi !) to 12 monlbs old, 
 or the Berkshire at from 12 lo l.") months idd, at 
 which ages it will be found most profit.ible lo kill 
 these respective breeds. With re^-ard to fresh pork, 
 it is brought in two difli-rent forms to mari.ei; in the 
 first stage, in wiiicli may be termed porklings, the 
 carcase weighing frcun 40 to lbs. each : in this 
 state the carcass is jiiinted iut,) hams, hands, sjiare- 
 rihs. loin", and belly-pieces. The spareribs and loins 
 are always used as n a'ting pieci s.theh ims Ind saimi- 
 nately for roasting and pickling. The bands and 
 belly-pieces are always pickled : for this puip.ise no 
 breed answers so well as the Essex; in this stiti! the 
 ontdde fat and skin, or crac^kling ns it is called, is 
 cut ali>n; with the lean part and so served at table.
