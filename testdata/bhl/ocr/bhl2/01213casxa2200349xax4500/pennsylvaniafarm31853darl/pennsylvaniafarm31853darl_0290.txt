GRAPE CULTURE— SPADING vs. PLOUGHING. 

[November, 

and cuttings ave preserved in cool cellars until tlie 
 ground is warm and dry, or mellow. Tlie first sea- 
 son's superfluous shoots are pulled off, leaving but 
 one or two to grow, and but one eventually. In the 
 i-pring the vine is cut down to a single eye, and one 
 .•<lalk or cane allowed to grow, tied to a stake, — no 
 suckers bring allowed to grow. The second spring 
 after planting, cut down to two cr three eyes, or joints, 
 and the third year to four or five, pinching ofl' later- 
 als and tying up. Tliis year, two stalks are trained 
 to the stake, and so i e grapes will be produced. The 
 vino is now cstablislieil. Tlio fourth pruning requires 
 "■ood judgment. The best shoot of the former year 
 is cut down to six or eight joints, and fastened 
 to the adjoining stake in a horizontal position, or 
 bent over in the form of a bow, and tied to its own 
 stake. The other stalk is cut down to two or three 
 eyes, to make bearing wood tor the next season. 

The pioneer in this extending enterprise was JVIr. 
 Nicholas Longworth, now over seventy years of age. 
 For thirty years he experimented with foreign grapes, 
 with a view to their acclimation in the United States. 

Sis thousand vines of the best Madeira wine grapes, 
 and seven thousand from the Mountains of Jura, in 
 France, besides others from the vicinity of Paris and 
 Bordeaux were procured, but which were all thrown 
 away, after a protracted trial, being found inferior 
 to the Catawba, a native. Near 200 varieties of grape 
 have been tested, but the two best are found to be 
 the Catawba and Ilerbemont. The latter makes a 
 wine similar to the Spanish Manzauilla, and will be 
 mere extensively cultivated hereafter. 

Recent Improvements in Machines for tilling 
 THE Son..— Sp-iDiNG VS. PLOUGHING. — A Very ifiter- 
 esting paper on the above has recently been read be- 
 fore the British Association for the advancement of 
 Science, by which it appears steam cultivators, dig- 
 ging machines, ploughing machines, drawn by sta- 
 tionary as well as locomotive steam engines, and ro- 
 tary machines for pulverizing by means of forks' 
 spades or claws, are being seriously talked of in Eng- 
 land for general introduction in place of the ordinary 
 plough and team. 

It is objected to the plough, among other inconve- 
 niences, that while it loosens and reverses the top 
 soil, it compresses the bottom of the furrow and dam- 
 ages the sub soil, which is pressed and hardened by 
 the share. The new implements or diggers appear 
 to be designed, not only to work deeper than the 
 plough, but to thoroughly disintegrate and pulverize 
 every particle of soil, thus leaving it in a condition, 
 not only to draw nutriment from the atmosphere, but 
 expedite the decomposition of the inorganic constitu 
 cuts of the soil, in fine to make a deep and perfect 
 bed ready for the reception of the seed. It is con- 
 tended that the new dynasty of steam has superseded 
 the old one of the plough. 

From experiments in England, it would seem not 
 improbable these enormous steam diggei'S, may some 
 day not distant, be found going around to dig, sub- 
 soil and pulverize, at one operation, fields at a fixed 
 price per acre, same as drilling, reaping, mowing and 
 threshing machines are at present. As a matter of 
 curiosity and information to our readers, we copy a 
 description of one of these machines, which seems 
 much approved of, and has answered well on trial. — 
 The inventor says, "the forks of my digging machine 
 are made of the best cast-steel that I can procure, of 
 a square section, slightly tapered, bent on an angle 
 and in pairs, at a cherry heat, and allowed to cool 
 gradually. They are curved, so as to enter the ground 
 easily, but to lift the soil as they come out. Tho up- 
 per portion of six such pairs being laid between two 
 half discs of cast iron, grooved to receive them, tho 
 half disc? being afterwards united by bolts, form a 
 digging wheel of which the discs represent the boss, 
 and the points of the forks the spokes; there is no 
 hoop or tire. A number of these digging wheels 
 (seven in a full sized machine) are hung on a bar, 
 around which they rotate freely. Between each pair 
 of wheels, and on the same bar is hung a ring which 
 keeps thema'-art, and cleans the sides of the bosses. 
 The frame containing the bar with the digging wheel 
 also holds a number of cleaners, the ends of which 
 scrape the soil from the circumference of the bosses, 
 and force it from the prongs. This frame, to which 
 the shafts and draught links for the horses are also 
 attached, is itself hung in front on another bar, con- 
 necting two segmental frames, one on each side of 
 tho digging frame. These contain the wheels on 
 wliich the implement rests when it is not in action, 
 and which also serve to regulate the depth to which 
 the forks of the digging frame are allowed to pene- 
 trate the ground. The segments (at the back of the 
 travelling wheel frams) being toothed, two pinions 
 gear into them, the place of which on the segments 
 determine the height at which the digging frame is 
 sustained; a winch attached to the latter works the 
 pinions. 

When the horses move forward the attendant 
 throws out of gear a pawl, which hold the pinions at 
 any given point; the digging frame runs down by its 
 own weight, the prongs enter the ground, and the 
 depth of their penetration is increased or diminished 
 by turning the winch in opposite directions, thereby 
 causing more or less weight to rest on the travelling 
 and digging wheels respectively. Meanwhile the re- 
 sistance offered by the earth in front of the prongs 
 causes the latter to revolve and portions of the soil 
 to be detached, which are thrown back, after having 
 been lifted and broken by contact with the cleaning 
 bars. 

A full sized machine weighs a ton, and breaks up 
 a depth not exceeding 10 inches, a breadth of 3 feet 
 at a time, equal to that of four ploughs, and equiva-
