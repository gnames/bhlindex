lont to .about five acres in seven hours. The druug'.it 
 requh-ed varies, according to the n.ature and state of 
 the soil, from four to seven horses. A smaller imple- 
 ment is made for occupiers of land vrhose horse-pow- 
 er is limited, capable of working about 3 acres, in 
 the same time, with three or four horses. About 30 
 digging machines, corresponding with the descrip- 
 tion which I have given, are at work in various parts 
 of this country; one of them in this immediate neigh- 
 borhood, on the estate of Mr. Robert Harrison, of 
 Binningholme Hall." 

The article, the author of which is Mr. Samuelson 
 of Banbury, concludes thus: 

"Whatever may be the success of .all or any of the 
 cultivating machines which I have brought under 
 your notice, enough has certainly betn done to de- 
 monstrate that wo have entered upon a new epoch in 
 the mechanics of tillage; and that, how long soever 
 the dominion of the plough may be destined to last, 
 it is not henceforth to reign alone. Meanwhile I 
 was anxious to direct the attention of our machinist 
 to a branch of their profession, than which none 
 stands more in need of cultivation, and none will 
 more amply repay it. We are dealing with a depart- 
 ment of industry which, until lately, was oppressed 
 with an excess of human labour, whilst the whole of 
 its produce was liable to be depreciated fiir more than 
 any other, in value, by a comparatively trifling in- 
 crease in its amount. Bat now the tables are turn- 
 ed, the supply of agricultural labour diminishes 
 daily, whilst consumption is extending beyond all 
 precedent, and the cultivator of the soil looks eagerly 
 to the mechanic to cheapen his operations, and, joint- 
 ly with the chemist, to aid him in making two blades 
 grow where one only gi-evv before." 

To Pickle Oysters. 

Pour them into a cullender, and drain the liquor 
 into a kettle; boil and skim it; then put in tlie oysters 
 and lot them come to a boil, previously rinsing tliem 
 with cold water, which should be drained off; lift 
 them out with a skimmer, and sprinkle with good 
 vinegar to suit the taste; then cover to pi-event their 
 growing dark; strain the boiling liquor on a few 
 cloves, allspice and mace; when cold pour it over the 
 oysters, and keep them in a cold place; add salt if 
 necessary. 

Boston Gingerbread, 

Three cups of flour, one cup of butter, one cup of 
 molasses, two eggs, one table spoonful of dissolved 
 saloaratus, two lirge table spoonfuls of ginger, one 
 table spoonful of cinnamon, milk enough to form a 
 dough. Rub the butter and flour together, and add 
 the other ingredients. Roll it out in sheets, cut thin, 
 butter your tins, place them and wash the cake o\er 
 wit*! molasses and water before they are put in the 
 oven. They require a very moderate heat to bake 
 them, as they easily scorch. 

Superior Washing Soap. 

Dissolve one pound of soda and half a pound of 
 hot lime in one gallon of boiling water; nest dissolve 
 one pound of sliced hard soap, in two quarts 
 of boiling water; when cool mix them together. This 
 forms a compound for washing linen, &c., superior 
 to any of the washing fluids and patent soaps in 
 use. 

When the much dreaded "washing day" comes 
 round, make a strong suds of this soap, and boil the 
 clothes, previously soaked, for half an hour. Take 
 out, drain well, pour boiling water on them, when 
 they will be found to be clean, nothing more being 
 required than to rinse well to free them from the re- 
 mains of the suds. 

Com Pudding. 

Take four dozen ears of corn, neither very young 
 or very old, and grate them on an or linary grate of 
 a large size, then add a table spoonful of fine salt, 
 and two table S|.oonfuls of fine sugar, add four eggs, 
 beaten very light, and milk varying in. quantity from 
 half a pint to a pint, according to the age of the 
 corn; bake in shallow dishes until quite brown, and 
 eat hot with butter. 

I.ightened Pone. 

Take half a gallon of corn meal, pour boiling 
 water on one-third of it; mix it together with warm 
 water till it is a thick, batter, put in two table spoon 
 fuls of boiling yeast, and one of salt; stir it well and 
 set by the fire to raise; when it begins to open on the 
 top, grease your pan and bake it. 
 Starching. 

Take two ounces of fine white gum arable, put it 
 in a pitcher and pour on it one pint of boiling water, 
 cover it and let it stand all night, in the morning pour 
 it in a bottle and cork it; a table spoonful of it put in 
 a pot of ordinary starch will improve it very much. 
 M-ryland Corn Cakes. 

Mix a pint of corn meal with rich milk, a little 
 salt, and an egg: it should be well beaten with a 
 spoon, and made thin enough to pour on the iron; 
 b.ake in cakes the size of a breakfast plate, butter 
 and send them hot to table. 

To Preserve Tomatoes for Winter. 

Take any quantity of tomatoes, scald them and 
 take off the skin; put them in bottles and place them 
 uncorked in a pot of hot water, and let them boil 
 five or six hours; cork them while hot. 
 Worcester lioar. 

Three pints of flour, three eggs, one pint of Milk 
 (warm) half pint of yeast, a quarter pound of butter. 
 To rise three hours, and baki' in a Turk.-; c.ip, or oth- 
 er pan. 

To Pickle Plums. 

Half "-ound of sugar, half pint of vinegar, a few 
 cloves to one pound of plums; put in the oven throe 
 times, on successive baking days.
