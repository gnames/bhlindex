WORK FOR THE MONTH. 

Farm. 

This, the eleventh month of the year, is the last 
 generally for active, out ot doors operations. The 
 farmer who is in the habit of taking time by the 
 forelock, and keeping ahead of his work, wlio knows 
 the true economy of doing every thing in its right 
 time, putting every thing in its proper place, and con- 
 verting every thing to its proper use, will during this 
 month have all hia crops harvested and well secured 
 and be at leisure to make arrangements for the ap. 
 preaching winter. All implements "not wanted 
 should be carefully placed away under cover. — 
 Cattle sheds and cow stabling should be exam- 
 ined and put in proper order this month. Pro- 
 vide for securing proper drainage. Collect leaves 
 and have them convenient for use in stables or hog 
 pens. Avoid commencing the winter with more 
 stock than can be put through with safety and cer- 
 tainty. Nothing is more unprofitable than to be 
 obliged to stint supplies of food. Animals should 
 not only have enough to live on, but to thrive on. — 
 Calves and young stock require extra shelter and 
 good stabling. Every barnyard should also be pro- 
 vided with .shedding, and a constant supply of water 
 and rock salt. Fattening hogs should have all they 
 want, but not wasteful and profuse feeding. A cat- 
 tle card should always be at hand, and used at every 
 opportunity. It greatly promotes thrift and health- 
 Haul and stack corn fodder convenient to the barn' 
 so as to be cut up on barn floor by one of the iraprov 
 ed corn stalk cutters and grinders. For experiments 
 with this mode of using fodder, refer to the last vol- 
 ume, page 322. 

Have a good supply of roots, sugar beets, carrots 
 or turnips ready for milch cows, so soon as there is a 
 failure in pasture. To keep them milking through 
 winter the supply of succulent food should be com 
 menced early and kept up. If they are allowed to 
 fall off in their milk, for a time, there will bo more 
 difficulty afterwards. 

growing, will keep flowering for some time, but for 
 this purpose, it is much better that they should hava 
 been kept in pota through summer. Take up also, 
 for blooming in parlor Mignionette, Neapolitan Vio- 
 lets, Sweet Alysaum, Stock Gillya and Chinese Prim- 
 rose. If the ground is very dry, water well before 
 lifting, so as to have some earth adhering to the 
 roots. All freshly potted plants, should for a few- 
 days be kept closely shaded. 

Cut down and carry away, all such plants as have 
 been hurt by frost. As soon as Dahlia tops are kill- 
 ed, lift the roots, cutting off within a few inches of 
 the ground. Dry them a short time in the sun, re- 
 move carefully, the earth which adheres, then invert 
 them for a few days, with tops down to drain off 
 moisture, after which they may be removed to their 
 winter quarters, which may be on a shelf in a dry 
 cellar, free from frost, or they may be packed in dry 
 sand. 

Fluwer Gardens. 

Orange and Lemon Trees, Pomegranates, Lager- 
 stremias, Abuteilons and such half hardy ornamen- 
 tal shrubs, as have been standing out should now be 
 taken up immediately, and placed in a dry cellar. — 
 Oranges and Lemons should be placed where there 
 is no danger of frost, and to prevent losing their 
 leaves, should 1 ave plenty of light and free circula- 
 tion of air in open weiither. Should the leaves drop, 
 they will not flower the ne.\t season. Lift and pot 
 at once — Geraniums, Salvias, Heliotropes, and such 
 other plants as ai-e tenacious of frost. If taken up 
 with care they will reward with bloom, through 
 winter. Verbenas with good roots, if potted and 
 placed in a warm room, where they will continue 

Lift all tender Bulbs, Tuberose, Gladiolus, Tiger 
 flowers, Amaryllis, &c., and lay away as Dahlias in 
 a dry place. If not already done, plant beds of Tu- 
 lips and Hyacinths. Trench a piece of ground, en- 
 riching well with short manure. Plant the Bulbs 
 nine inches apart, and three inches deep. When 
 hard weather approaches, cover with long litter or 
 leaves. Now is a good time to divide and replant 
 Herbaceous plants. Peonies, Ac. Put out seedling 
 Hollyhocks where they are to bloom. Lift Carna- 
 tions and Pinks which have been layered, and place 
 in a cool frame for the winter. Water occasionally, 
 and give fresh air in mild days. Chrysanthemums 
 if taken up carefully and potted ia large pots and 
 well watered, may be retained in bloom for a consid- 
 erable time in the house. The Lilliputian or divarf 
 varieties which are generally much later than the 
 others, should be taken up at once and potted. They 
 bloom much finer in the house. Water occasionally 
 with Guano water, or liquid manure, to increase the '. 
 size of flowers. One pound of Guano, to five gallons 
 of water, is a suitable strength. 

Take up roses for early spring blooming; We rb- 
 coramend for this. Pink Dailies, and most of the 
 Bengals, Tea Cels, Devoniensis, Souvenir de Mal- 
 maisun and Hermoea. 

To make an attractive display of flowers in-doors, 
 early in spring, when they will be most highly valu- 
 ed, take up and place in large pots, Wiegelia rosea, 
 Persian Lilacs, Spirea Reevosii, Prunifulia, and For- 
 sythia Viridissima. Our native Kalmia Latifolia is 
 much esteemed in England, for early spring forcing 
 in pots. Hardy annual seeds, such as dwarf German 
 Larkspurs, purple and white Candytufts, CoUinsia 
 Bicolor, ditto Verna, Clarkia Grandiflora, and Ele- 
 gans— Gillia Tricolor, should have been sown laflt 
 month, but if the weather keeps open, may still do 
 on a warm rich border; cover up with leaves on ap- 
 proach of severe weather.
