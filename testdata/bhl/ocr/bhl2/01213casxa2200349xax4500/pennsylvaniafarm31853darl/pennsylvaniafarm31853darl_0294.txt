Scientific American. — The ninth volume of this 
 standard periodical commenced on the first of Sep- 
 teniher. It is issued weelily, each volume containing 
 several hundred engravings and over 400 pages of 
 reading matter, All the valuable patents which issue 
 weekly from the patent office are illustrated in it. — 
 Price only §2 per year. It vrould be difficult to over- 
 rate the able manner in wliich tliis paper is conduct- 
 ed. Its editor seems resolutely opposed to all hum- 
 bug, and has courage enough to stem the tide of the 
 popular current when taking a wrong direction, as 
 in the case of the caloric engine, which it brought 
 down at once to the level of what public opinion only 
 now concedes to it. In its notice of new patents 
 and inventions, we haye admired its course as ready 
 to give censure as praise_\vhere it rightly belongs. — 
 "We will with pleasure act as agents for any of our 
 friends who wish to subscribe. 

Landscape Gardening, Parks and Pleasure 
 Grounds by Charles II. Smith, with notes and 
 ADDITIONS BV Lewis F. Allen. Price $1,25.— This 
 is an American edition of an English work, whose 
 author has had an experience of eighteen years, as a 
 professional Landscape Gardener. The American 
 editor has made it more adapted to our own soil and 
 climate. It treatsthe subject (to which too little at. 
 tention has been paid here) under its various divi- 
 sions, such as the arrangement of buildings, the ap- 
 proach, laying out pleasure grounds and flower gar. 
 dens, also kitchen and fruit gardens, construction of 
 artificial lakes or ponds, fences, public parks, &c., 
 and finally the Arboretum and Pinotum, with an ar- 
 rangement according to the natural system. We 
 give in anotlier column an extract on planting and 
 transplanting evergreens. It is well worth purcha- 
 sing for those about to locate new lawns or re-arran»e 
 old ones.

Elements of Agricultural Chemistry and Geol. 
 orn- DY .James F. AV. Johnston, with a complete in- 
 dex and American preface liy Simon Brown, editor 
 of the New England Farmer. This is condensed 
 from the larger work, "Lectures on Agricultural 
 Chemistry and Geology, by the same author," so fa- 
 vorably known bore ami in Europe as a profin.iul, no 
 less than truly practical writer on these subjects. The 
 present work should be in the possession of every 
 farmer, and is perhaps in a more useful form than 
 the larger, and more strictly scientific one from whii-h 
 it is condensed. The information it contains is in- 
 di.ipmsahle to every one who wishes to pursue the 
 cultivation of the soil nnclerstandhir/ly, that is with a 
 knowledge of the principles on which all successful 
 practice must be based. To give some idea of its 
 practical character we quote below portions of a 
 chapter on Guano. It is published by Saxton, and 
 can be had at the agricuUural warehouses and book- 

stores in Philadelphia. Price $1,00. We take the 
 following extract from its pages : 

1. Adulteration of yiiann. — In consequenee of the 
 high price of guano, the great demand for it, 
 and the ease with which the unwary farmer 
 may be imposed upon, guano is adulterated 
 with various substances, and to a great extent. — 
 Impositions even have been practised by selling as 
 genuine guano artificial mixtures, made to look so 
 like guano that the practical man in remote districts 
 is unable to detect it. A sample of such pretended 
 guano, which had been sold in the neighborhood of 
 Wigtown, and h.id been fo'ind to produce no effect 
 upon the crops, when examined in my laboratory, 
 was found to contain, in the state in which it was 
 sold, more than half its weight in gypsum — the rest 
 rest being peat or coal ashes, with a little common 
 salt, sulphate of ammonia, and either dried urine or 
 the refuse of the glue manufactories, to give it a 
 smell. I could not satisfy myself that it contained a 
 particle of real guano. Burnt earth and brick-dust 
 are now prepared of various shades, and in fine pow- 
 der, in special manufactories, for the purpose of mix- 
 ing with guano and with artificial manures. These 
 facts show how important it is that the farmer should 
 possess some means of readily, and at a cheap rate, 
 testing the costly manures he employs.* 

2. Ill sdniinij a r/ood griano, the following simple 
 observations will aid the practical man : 

a. The drier the better — ^therc is less water to pay 
 for and to transport. 

h. The lighter the color, the better also. It is the 
 less completely decomposed. 

c. If it has not a strong aramoniacal smell, it 
 ought to give off such a smell when a spoonful of it 
 is mixed with a spoonful of slaked lime in a wine 
 glass. _ 

d. When put into a tumbler with water, stirred 
 well about, and the water and fine matter poured off, 
 it ought to leave little sand or stones. 

e. AVhen heated to redness in the air till all the 
 animal matter is burned away, the ash should nearly 
 all dissolve in dilute muriatic acid. The insoluble 
 matter is useless sand or earthy adulterations. 

f. In looking at the numbers in a published analy- 
 sis of a Peruvian guano, those representing the water 
 should be small; the organic matter containing am- 
 monia sliould approach to 50 or 60 per cent.; the 
 phosphates sliould not much exceed 20 per cent.; and 
 the common salt and sulph te of soda ought not to 
 firm much more than 5 or G per conl. of the weight 
 of the guano. In Saldanhn Bay guano the propor- 
 tion of phosphates was much greater,' and of organic 
 matter less. 

o. Tlie natiunal eidvc of guano, and the consequent 
 impurtance of preventing adulteration as far as pos- 
 sible, may be judged of from three important facts: 

(/. From the amount of the importation of it into 
 this country, which, during the last ten years, has 
 been as follows: — 

h. That the quantity imported in 1851 would sell 
 for upwards of two millions sterling, and with good 
 management ought to produce two or three times its 
 own value in grain or vegetable food. In other words 
 such a yearly supply of guano is equal to the impor-
