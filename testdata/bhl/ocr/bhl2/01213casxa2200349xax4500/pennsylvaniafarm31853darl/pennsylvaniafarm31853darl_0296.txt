nn ample supply of cheap cjrn to butchers, enable 
 both parties to adopt the best policy which science 
 and experience can dictate. And they should endea- 
 Tor to act in accordance with one another's interest; 
 for if the ftrmer, for instance, feeds his ox on the full 
 nllowance of Turnips and oilcake up to the hour it 
 leaves for market, as is too frequently the case, it 
 may often be impossible for the drover, salesman, 
 and butcher, to introduce the necessary change so as 
 to present to the public butcher-meat undeteriorated 
 in quality. For a few days, for instance, before the 
 Ox leaves home it should befed purposely with a view 
 ()f improvino; the quality of its flesh; for it is a well 
 known fact tliat turnips, oilcake, and several other 
 orticles contain elements which, being readily absor- 
 bed into the system, tend to deteriorate the quality of 
 the meat.

Onio Dressed Meats in New York in August. 
 — We dined yesterday upon as fine a quarter of lamb 
 fts wo ever tasted, which was butchered in Columbus, 
 Ohio, and brought here in a refrigerator can, by rail- 
 road, and we expect to dine to-morrow upon a pair of 
 fine fowls, as sweet as though dressed te-day, which 
 came in the same way. If any of our readers desire 
 to satisfy themselves that our meats may be all butch- 
 ered in Ohio and sent to us in perfect order, they can 
 do 80 by calling upon D. Tilton", No. 8 AVashington 
 Market, who furnished us with the above specimens. 
 We are glad to chronicle this cvent.though not a very 
 new one, a? large quantities of game have been sent 
 here from the AVest in the same way, because it 
 proves how eas" the thing can bo done, and how 
 much better it would be to have our meats brought 
 ready dressed from the country, thus saving the a- 
 bominable nuisances of bull-fights and cow-chases in 
 the streets, and gutters of gore among the dwellings 
 of women and children. Success to the enterprise. 
 If those who are engaged in the enterprise will give 
 ns the reports we will publish every arrival. — New 
 York Tribune, AugiiH 31. 

The above article from the New York Tribune, is 
 a striking illustration, of the changes from the uso 
 of steam, in the condition of the country compared 
 with twenty years ago. Space is now measured by 
 time, and by the aid of refrigcator cars, provisions 
 already prepared fop the cook on the seaboard, can 
 be safely transported from 1000 miles in the interior. 
 The future President of the United States, who is 
 now said to be "running barefoot among the huckle- 
 berry bushes of Oregon," may ere long be able to 
 bring his berries tothc Atlantic coast fresh as picked 
 on a pleasant market trip of a few days, and peddle 
 them along the streets of New York and Philadel- 
 phia, thus giving the good people in those two cities, 
 ftn opportunity to see him. 

It is difficult to make any calculations as to the 
 sourse of trade in the present age of wonders, but it 
 would not be extraordinary if the plan for slaughter- 
 ing and dressing meats, far in the interior, thus 
 ftvoiding the expense of transporting so much offal, 
 sliould be found cheaper than bringing the live an- 
 imals. In ice houses on vessels, fresh provisions, are 
 tept safe for many weeks, and ice cars or refrigera- 
 tors, could readily be constructed for transporting

PROFESSOR LIEBIG. 
 Mb. Editor: — 

I have no doubt but that it will be 
 considered the height of presumption in a plain far- 
 mer, to attempt to criticise the writings of such a 
 a man as Liebig. But as a poor mechanic was per- 
 mitted to criticise the work of the greatest artist of 
 Greece, I also may be tolerated in cdjecting to what 
 every practical farmer knows to be wrong in the 
 theories of Liebig, provided, that like the shoemaker 
 of Athens, I stick to my last. 

Liebig may be a great chemist, but for the want 
 of a practical knowledge of agriculture, ho has made 
 the most glaring mistakes, and, if followed, would 
 have caused farmers more loss than multicaulis, 
 Rohan potatoes, and Chilian guano united. 

For the purpose of showing what a Yankee chem- 
 ist thinks of Liebig's theories, I should be much 
 pleased if you would re-pnblish Professor Norton's 
 communication, which you will find in the Patent 
 Office Report for 1851, page 7; as in my humble 
 opinion it contains more Qnmmon sense, and practi- 
 cal knowledge, than any thing previously written by 
 agricultural chemists in Europe or America. 

I should not have called your attention to thia 
 subject at present, but for the very high terms in 
 which Dr. Emerson spoke of Liebig, in his address 
 to the farmers of this county, at our agricultural ex- 
 hibition, last September. I should not have been 
 surprised at such praise from a mere theorist, but 
 from a practical man, like the Doctor, I raustconfes* 
 it did surprise me. 

It ought not to discourage agricultural chemists to 
 bfc told, that so fivr they have been of no pecuniary 
 advantage to farmers. Even Dr. Emerson admits 
 that the Belgians and Chinese make land produce 
 the heaviest crops the world has ever seen, and they 
 certainly know less of chemistry, and in fact use less 
 mineral manure than farmers generally do, either 
 in this country or Europe. 

Agricultural chemistry may be compared to a tree 
 that is planted, has grown, and may have blossomed, 
 but as yet has born no fruit. But I hope to see tho 
 day, when much that farmers have discovered, by 
 groping in the dark, and much yet to bo discovered, 
 will be made as plain as noon-day, by the aid of 
 chemistry. But so far it has been our own experi- 
 ence, and tba experience of others, as given in ag- 
 ricultural publications, that has given us our strong- 
 est light. 

It was seeing what others are doing, that brought 
 the turnip husbandry from the continent to England 
 and guano from Peru to the United States; introdu- 
 ced plaster, lime, Ijone dust, under draining, sub 
 soiling, rotation of crops, &c., &o.
