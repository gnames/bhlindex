It ia the pnictical success and example of such 
 men as Messrs. Dickeys, of this oouny, and "a few 
 more of tliD same sort," (as the razor strop man 
 would say,) that we arc drawing the most benefit 
 from at present. V. W. I.

Eds. op Cultivator: — The subject which I have 
 placed at the head of this letter is not one which can 
 be fully discussed in a single page of your journal; 
 and yet it is one of so much importance, that I de- 
 cire to make a few explanations and statements re- 
 garding the shape which it has now assumed among 
 scientific men. When I mention the "mineral ma- 
 nure theory," I speak of that view of manures 
 which ascribes all, or nearly all, of their efficacy to 
 their mineral constituents. The principal suppor- 
 ter, and, indeed, the originator, ot the theory, is 
 Professor Liebig. This distinguished chomist, dis- 
 tinguished no less by his clear and lucid style than 
 by his high scientific reputation, was for a time de- 
 voted to the "ammonia theory," excluding those 
 mineral manures to which he now attaches so much 
 importance. A few years since, however, he saw 
 cause to change his ground, and has since held that, 
 if we furnish mineral manures in abundance, plants 
 will, without doubt, always obtain their ammonia, 
 or rather nitrogen, from the atmosphere of the soil. 

In pursuance of this idea, ho went so far as to 
 compound, after a careful study of ash analysis, spe- 
 cific mineral manures for wheat, rye, oats, turnips, 
 &c., which were to take efi'eot upon all soils in a 
 proper physical condition. The failure of these 
 specific mmures, which were patented in England, 
 was, as many of your readers are aware, very de- 
 cisive. I had supposed the subject rather at rest, 
 but find that,in the last edition of Professor Liebig's 
 "Letters on Cheni'stry," published so late as the 
 commencement of the present pear, he reiterates his 
 former views on this subject in a most decisive man- 
 ner, and prophesies that our future agriculture will 
 depend upon them, however much wo may distrust 
 and disbelieve tliem now. I have also had occasion 
 to observe quite recently that some gentlemen of high 
 standing among our scientific men follow Liebig in 
 this as well as in other theories. For these reasons 
 I have thought it best to express my own opinions 
 on this contested point, in order that our farmers 
 mxy be aware that all chemists do not hold to views 
 which militate nbnost directly against tho ordinary 
 results of practice. 

My belief was that, when Professor Liebig advo- 
 cated the "ammonia theory," ho was nearer right 
 than he is now, when he only admits the necessity 
 of mineral manure; not that he was right then, but 
 that better results would, in must cases, be obtained 
 by the farmer in the use of ammoniacal or nitroge- 
 nous manures alone than by the use of mineral ma- 
 nures alone. We find land in all parts of the coun- 
 try where strictly mineral applications, such as lime, 
 pla^t;r, marl, &c., fail to produce any marked effect; 
 but if up;in any of our fields we apply guano, or 
 sulphate, or carbonate of ammonia, the cliaraottr of 
 the vegetation is at once changed, its color alters, 
 its luxuriance and vigor increase, and in a great 

majority of cases the product is augmented. Every 
 farmer who has observed matters intelligently knows 
 that the above statements are correct; indeed, they 
 have been so far applied in practice, that the quan- 
 tity of ammonia which any manure contains is Li- 
 ken as the highest standard of its value. A guano, 
 for instance, with the usual per centage of ammo- 
 nia, vi'ill bring twice as much as one which contains 
 little ammonia, even though this deficiency is re- 
 placed by the most valuable possible mineral con- 
 stituents. I must not be understood to say that min- 
 eral manures are not valuable; on the contrary, I 
 have the highest opinion of them, and recommend 
 their application in almo.st all cases where my advice 
 is asked. The mineral constituents of the plant are 
 no less indispensable than its organic part, and if 
 one or two of them are absent from the soil, the 
 plant will not flourish. There are many instances 
 of these special deficiencies, which special mineral 
 manures alone will supply, and there are certain 
 mineral substances which have been found especially 
 valuable. The most valuable of all these is phos- 
 phoric acid. Now, tho phosphates — that is, the com- 
 pounds of this acid — are not more necessary to the 
 plant than are the alkalies, but the supply is far 
 more apt to be scanty; and this — not its intrinsic im- 
 portance to the plant — is the cause of its higher 
 value to the farmer. The same principle applies 
 when we aay that nitrogenous manures, of which 
 ammonia ia the most common form, are more valua- 
 ble than others known in agriculture. They are 
 volatile, easily decomposable, and very soluble; for 
 all of these reasons, they are extremely apt to dis- 
 appear most rapidly. These manures, then, are 
 worth more to the farmer than any others, because 
 they are must likely to be nee led, and because their 
 scarcity renders it somewhat difficult to obtain a 
 good supply. 

I make these statements fearlessly and confident- 
 ly, although against so high an authority as Liebeg. 
 1 should not presume to differ from him on mere 
 theoretical grounds, but I feel that I am here sus- 
 tained bv almost uniform practical results. It must 
 be acknowledged that we have occasional instances 
 reported of plants grown upon soils nearly or quite 
 destitute of vegetable matter: but in most of these 
 that have fallen under my observation, the fact of 
 tho entire absence of vegetable, and particularly of 
 nitrogenous matter, has not been sufficiently estab- 
 lished. The information that they give is neither 
 entirely definite, nor well enough made out, by con- 
 tinuous and careful experiments, to be set off against 
 an array of facts brought forward in favor of the op- 
 posite view. Single experiments, for a single year, 
 must always be looked upon with distrust until am- 
 ply verified; and it is by mainly trusting to such, so 
 far aa we are infjrmed, that the exclusive mineral 
 theory has been built up. The laboratory alone is 
 pretty sure to go wrong when it attempts to pre- 
 scribe rules for practice. The chemist must go into 
 the field and study actual experience if he would 
 serve the farmer etfcctually. It has been my inten- 
 tion to experiment somewhat largely upon this par- 
 ticular subject; but in the last number of the Jour- 
 nal of the Royal Agricultural Society of En<;land is 
 a paper of ^fess^s. Lawes and Gilbert, that almost 
 precludes the necessity of doing any thing nmro. 
 These gentlemen have been experimenting on a 
 large scale for tho last ten years, and I heir results 
 are clearly and admirably set forth. They took a 
 field at the close of a four years' rotation, when tho 
 manures added at tho commencement of the course
