ORGANIC AND MINERAL MANURES-JAPAN PEA, ic 

[November 

were exhausted. On this ground they have cultiva- 
 ted wheat for ten years under various conditions. 
 One plot remained unmanured, and the produce of 
 this served as a standard and a startini; point for 
 comparison during the whole period. Thus, if its 
 yield in 1845 was seventeen bushels per acre, the 
 improvement over this in an adjoining plot, other- 
 wise the same, was set down to the advantage of 
 whatever manure had been employed. Such a sys- 
 tem of cropping, continued for so long a time, ob- 
 viously affords results that are vrortliy of much con- 
 fidence. The first year's comparative practice was 
 made with various approved mineral manures alone. 
 It was found that, even by the addition of large 
 quantities of these, the increase of product over the 
 unmanured plot was but trifling. In the next year 
 the same character of mineral manures were em 
 ployed, but with the addition in several cases of ani- 
 moniacal or nitrogenous substances. In all of these 
 the effect was quite marked, the yield increasing to 
 ten, twelve, and fourteen bushels, above the unma- 
 nured plot. This, in short, was the character of all 
 the results; sometimes ammoniacal manures alone 
 were added, and then the increase was several times 
 more th.an by mineral manures alone. One experi- 
 ment was very striking : four hundred weight per 
 acre of Liebig's special mineral manure, for wheat, 
 was applied to a plot, and produced an increase of 
 but about two or three bushels upon this same plot 
 in the next year. A purely ammoniacal manure 
 gave an increase often or twelve bushels. To make 
 the experiment still more conclusive, no manure 
 was added to this plot for the next crop, and the 
 yield then fell again almost to the original stand- 
 ard. 

These trials seem to me perfectly conclusive in 
 this matter, so far as wheat is concerned ; they 
 prove that ammoniacal manures increase its growth 
 far more than mineral manures, where both are al- 
 ready present in moderate supply, and that the ad- 
 dition of any amount of the latter will do little 
 good unless the former be also present. These 
 views are still further sustained by a very able pa- 
 per in one of the late French scientific journals. 
 The experiments in this case were made upon oats, 
 and were between forty and fifty in number. Thev 
 commenced by growing them out in sand, first de- 
 prived of every thing soluble by acid, and then 
 burned to draw off all vegetable matter. In this, 
 as might have been expected, no perfect plants were 
 produced. One minerals, bstance after another was 
 added, until at last it was found that, with a certain 
 series of them, the plant flourished better than with 
 any others. It, however, was still far from luxuri- 
 ant, or from j'ieldinga fair amount of grain. It was 
 not until some manures containing nitrogen had also 
 been added that entirely healthy, fertile, and strong 
 plants were obtained. These experiments appear to 
 have been very carefully conducted, and furnish ini- 
 portani; conformation to those of Messrs. Lawes and 
 Gilbert. 

There are other questions involved in these ex- 
 periments, which for want of space cannot be dis- 
 cussed here. The main point is, I think, fully es- 
 tablished. The farmer may supply special defi- 
 ciencies by special mineral manures, and should aim 
 to keep np the supply of mineral substances in the 
 soil; but he cannot render it fertile, and continue it 
 so, with them alone; he must also supply nitrogen 
 in some form, and will find it in a great majority of 
 cases the most important and efficacious of all ferti- 
 lizers. In despite of theoretical views to the contra- 

ry, he will find that, in practice, he can best afford 
 to give a high price for those manures — especially, 
 that are rich in ammonia or some uther compound 
 of nitrogen.

Messrs. Editors: — 

The "interesting correspon- 
 dence relating to the Japan Pea" copied in the 
 March No. of your Journal was, no doubit, road with 
 interest by many, and excited some curiosity. An 
 account of its successful culture in our county, and 
 an offer ot .seed may also prove acceptable. 

The distinguished and liberal 'Horticulturist of 
 Spring Garden, former President of the Cincinnati Hor- 
 ticultural Society— kindly sent me by mail, two pods, 
 each containing three of said peas; with directions, 
 to plant one foot apart. They were so planted, all 
 grew, and the product is now gathered, having ma- 
 tured perfectly. 

One stalk, 3 feet high and 23 feet in circumferanco 
 near the ground, produced 741 pods, (3 quarts by 
 measurement,) most of which contained only two 
 seeds each. 

To interested friends of hortijulture seed will be 
 furnished upon application. For a full description 
 of its introduction, growth, appearance and botanical 
 history, reference may be had to the correspondence 
 alluded to above. 

From personal experience nothing can bo said of 
 its edible properties, but a former resident of Lisbon 
 whis has seen it here, speaksi n terms of praise of 
 its superior qualities for table use in Portugal.

Foot Rot ill SUeep. 

We observe in one of our foreign exchanges, "pa- 
 tent gutta Pcrcha Boots," have been invented, for use 
 in this very troublesome and contagious disease, 
 among sheep. They keep the feet dry and warm, upon 
 cold wet land, prevent contagion, and are said to en- 
 tirely cure the rot. The remedy is higblyreeommen- 
 ded by the Yorkshire agricultural siiciety.

AoE OF SuEEP — IIow Determined. — The age of 
 sheep may be known by the front teeth. They are 
 eight in -number, and appear all of a size. In the 
 second year the two middle ones fall out, and their 
 place is supplied by two large ones. In the third. 
 year, a small tooth on each side. In the fourth year, 
 the large teeth are six in number. In the fifth year 
 the whole front teeth are large. In the sixth year, 
 the whole begin to get worn. In ihe seventh year, 
 the whole fall out, or are broken. It is said that the 
 tooth 111 the ewes begin to decay at five or six, those 
 of weathers at seven. 

Let no man be ashamed of doing whatever is ne- 
 cessary in his situation.
