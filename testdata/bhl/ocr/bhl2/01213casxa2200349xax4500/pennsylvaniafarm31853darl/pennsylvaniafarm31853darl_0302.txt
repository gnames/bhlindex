 tlie Peruvian agent has not connived with these par-

 him to have them published in the agricultural pa-

Plum Tree Warts. 

Messrs. Editors: — 

A fitting time has now come for 
 mo to redeem the promise made to you on the third 
 ■of last December. You are fully aware of the cir- 
 cumstances tliat have prevented my doing this soon- 
 er. I am now prepared not only ,.to give some ac- 
 count of tlie insects, supposed by many persons to be 
 the cause of the black knots or warts on plum trees, 
 in reply to your enquiries, together with my views 
 concerning the nature of these tumors on the trees, 
 but to add thereto the result of apparently success- 
 ful experiments for their cure and for their preven- 
 tion. My communication will necessarily be too 
 long to be inserted entire in one number of your pa- 
 per, and it will hardly a<lmit of being abridged. It 
 may, therefore, if you think pi'oper to print it, be di- 
 vided into several parts, each of wbicli may form an 
 article by itself. Under the first head, some remarks 
 will be made upon 

Insects that Pu.vgture Plum Trees. 

I have carefully read and reflected upon the inter- 
 estin"' letter, addressed to you, on the 17th of Novem- 
 ber, by Rev. Samuel L. Rookwood, of Hanson, and 
 have examined tlie punctured twig which he then 
 sent to you. This little twig contained a row, three 
 quarters of an inch long, of little punctures, extend- 
 ing obliquely to the pith, in each of wliicli had been 
 inserted a minute egg. Several of these eggs were 
 exposed when the part was cut open. They were 
 oblong oval, of a whitish color, and about one-twen- 
 tieth :.{ an inch long. At first sight, they might be 
 mistaken for tiny maggots, on account of their form 
 and their softness. As, in all respects, except their 
 minuteness, they resembled the eggs of the Cicada 
 seplciulecini, or seventeen-3'car locust, and were de- 
 posited much in the same wp.y as tliosc of the latter 
 insect, I had no hesitation in referring them to snino 
 insect of the same order. It is to be hoped that Mr. 
 Kockwood, agreeably to his intimation, has already 
 traced the progress of the insect from tlie egg to the 
 winged form, or at least has detected the parent in- 
 sect while making her deposit. This, ho observes, 
 was usually made iu twigs of the preceding year's 
 growtli, in ;vhich, moreover, the black knots are of- 
 tenest found to occur. It is not only possible, but 
 ■even highly probable, that the black warts or knots 
 would be developed in the punctured parts, should 
 the tree be in the condition, or exhibit any tendency, 
 to produce them at all. Whatever views may lie en- 
 tertained on the subject, it must be admitteil tliat 
 this concurring condition or tendency is required in 
 order to be followed by the result above named. Let 
 me illustrate my meaning by a familiar example. 
 The liites o! mosquitos arc fullowed, in most persons, 
 by inllammation and swellings. Some persons, how- 
 ever, are not in the physical condition, or have no 
 tendency, to be thus aS'ected; and hence with them 
 the bites of mosquitos are not followed by irritation 
 and tumors, Mr. Rockwood is probably right in 

supposing that he detected, in the punctured parts, 
 the signs of incipient warts, whose growth he ar- 
 rested very judiciously and promptly by cutting out 
 the part and applying soap to the wound. It would 
 give me pleasure, if space permitted, to embody the 
 whole of his letter to you iu this communication; but 
 I must pass to another of the same tenor. 

On the I9thof March, the Hon. B. P. .Johnson, of 
 Albany, Corresponding Secretary of the New York 
 State Agricultural Society, sent to me some twigs of 
 plum and cherry trees, which had been punctured by 
 insects, and also the insects by which these punc- 
 tures had been made. They were taken from the 
 trees of George Clark, Esq., of Springfield, Otsego 
 county, New York, who gave to Mr. Johnson the fol- 
 lowing account of them. The insects wore found to 
 deposit their eggs about the last of August. From 
 observations, made during three successive years, he 
 is satisfied that the black knots originate from the 
 punctures of this insect. His gardener has adopted 
 the plan of examining carefully the branches of the' 
 plum aod clierry trees, and cutting out the wounded 
 parts, and has thus succeeded in preventing the for- 
 mation of the knots; but, when the limb has been 
 left with the incisions upon it, the knots appeared 
 during the second season. My answer in full to Mr. 
 •Johnson's letter will be found in "the Horticulturist" 
 for Juno, pages 283 and 284. The appearance of 
 the -wounds and of the eggs cor.tained therein was 
 precisely similar to that of the specimens furnished 
 by Mr. Rockwood. The insect, that accompanied 
 these punctured twigs, was a small tree-hopper, de- 
 scribed by Fabricius under the name of Meinhracis 
 huhalus, and alluded to iu the second edition of my 
 Treatise on In.sects injurious to Vegetation, page 192. 
 It is one of the kinds whose history before has not 
 been particularly investigated, and of which it is 
 stated, in my work, that "the habits of some of the 
 tree-hoppers are presumed to be much the same as 
 those of the musical harvest-flies (or cicadas) ; for 
 they are found on the limbs of trees, where they de- 
 posit their eggs, only during the adult st\te, and 
 probably pass the early period of theif existence un- 
 der ground. 

Tbc above named tree hopper is a greenish insect, 
 aliout four-tenths of an inch iong, and one-filth of an 
 inch wide across the broadest part, or from tip to tip 
 of the lateral horns of the thorax. It is somewhat 
 wedge-shaped in form, being narrow and latterly 
 compressed behind, and widest before, where, on each 
 side, tiiere is a short liorn; on which account it ob- 
 tained the name of bicbahm, or the Buffalo. The 
 thorax, to which the horns pertain, is triangular be- 
 fore, and covers nearly the whole of the back with a 
 sliarp ridge. The face is vertical, and is not seen 
 from above. It has the power of leaping, in which 
 it is usually aided by its wings. Like other tree- 
 hoppers, it'sits upon a plant or tree in the longitudi- 
 nal direction of the twig on which it rests, with its 
 head towards the extremity of the twig; and it never 
 perches across a branch like a liird. While resting 
 as above described, its eggs are deposited ; fir which 
 purpose it is provided with a piercer, lodged in a 
 groove beneath the hinder part of the body. With 
 this piercer, when withdrawn from its groove, it punc- 
 tures the twig, and deposites iu each puncture a sin- 
 gle egg. The eggs appear to remain unhatched 
 through the winter. On being hatched in the spring, 
 or in the early part of summer, the young probably, 
 like the young of the cicada, drop or descend to the 
 grounil. burrow beneath the surface, and live there 
 upon the sap of the roots of plants, which they im-
