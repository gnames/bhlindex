TRANSPLANTING— DEPTH OF TREE ROOTS. 

[November 

whole animal becomes transformed. The vast plains 
 of Mesopotamia furnish the best breed.s, and those 
 breeds are divided into five races, of which the ori- 
 ginal stock was the Koyhelch. The most fiimous be- 
 long either to the Sh.ammer or to the Anejza tribes. 
 Their pedigrees are kept scrupulously, and their 
 v.ihie is 80 jircat that a thorough-bred mare is gen- 
 erally owned by ten or even more persons. It is not 
 often that a real Arabian can be purchased. The 
 reason is that on account of its floetness and power 
 of endurance it is invaluable to the Bedouin, who, 
 once on its back, can defy any pursuer e.icept a 
 Shammeror Aneyzawith a swifter mare than his own. 
 An American racer, or even an English hunter, 
 would break down in those pathless deserts almost 
 before an Arabian became warmed up to its work. — 
 Where thorough bred mares have been sold they have 
 brought as high as six thousand dollars: but these, it 
 is understood, are not the best of the race. 

The Arab who sells his mare can do nothing with 
 his gold, and cannot even keep it; for the next Be- 
 douin of a hostii:' tribe who comes across his path, 
 and who has retained his mare, will take it from him 
 and defy pursuit. Layard thinks that no Arabian of 
 the best blood has ever been seen in England. If this 
 i.s so, we can scarcely suppose that any have come to 
 America, but must believe the so-called Arabians 
 given to our Government at various times, to be of 
 inferior breeds. K.arely, indeed, arc the thorough- 
 breeds found beyond the desert. It will be a subject 
 of regret, to those who admire fine horses, to le<irn 
 that the Arabian is considered to be degenerating, 
 the consequence of the subjugation of Arabia, and 
 the decline of the Bedouin tribe. — Phila. Buildin.

Plantlu}j aud Transplanting of Evergrseus. 

The distribution of evergreen trees and shrubs is 
 among the most interesting operations in the forma- 
 tion and improvement of pleasure-grounds; in the 
 first, they give at once a clotheil appearance to what 
 was bare ground; and in tlio second, by their change 
 of position they effect an almost entire alteration in 
 the scenery of the place. Success, however, requires 
 not only careful execution, but also due attention to 
 the proper seasons for the performance of the work. 

In all cases, it is advisable that the ground should 
 be well drained and trenched; and where poor, it 
 should bo enriched with fresh soil O" manure, or both, 
 especially when the shrubs are young and bniall. — 
 Light sandy soils are greatly improved by moderate 
 additions of cbtyey loam or peat earth. In trans- 
 planting shrubs of considerable size, we prefer put- 
 ting the enriched soil or manure close round the ball, 
 and in contact with the young fibres. In such cases, 
 too, it is useful to prepare the pla.its, by cutting a 
 trench round them; a year or two previously, as re- 
 commended in relation to forest trees. 

All shrubs, and especially large ones, should have 
 an ample supply of water when they arc transplant- 
 ed, and this is most effectively given when the wa- 
 ter is run into the new pit in which the plant is placed 
 along witli the filling-inof the earth, beginning when 
 the pit is about one-fourth filled, and continuing till 
 it is nearly quite full- The quantity of the water 
 should be such as to form a strong puddle round the 
 ball. This mode of watering keeps the roots moist, 
 as well as consolidates the earth about thi m; and if 
 carefully done at first, will scarcely require any addi- 
 tions. If the water is not administered till after thy 
 earth has been fully pressed in round the roots, fre- 
 quent repetition ard l.irger quantities will be neces- 

sary, and the same beneficial results will not be at- 
 tained. 

There has been much difterence of opinion, and 
 many discussions, respecting the most suitable sea- 
 son for transplanting evergreen shrubs. Some re- 
 commend the autumn months, others the winter and 
 spring. 

It is admitted by all, that the transplantingof ever- 
 greens should not be attempted when the plants are 
 in full growth; for, though even then they may sur- 
 vive the shock, the chance is that most of them will 
 perish or die down to the ground. It seems also as- 
 certained, that the loss of the evergreens when trans- 
 planted is caused by the excess of perspiration from 
 their loaves, compared with the quantity of sap taken 
 up by their mutilated roots; and that, consequently, 
 dry, parching weather, at whatever season it occurs, 
 is, other things being equal, the most unpropitious 
 for the operations to which wo are now adverting. — 
 At first sight, this principle might seem to exclude 
 the end of summer and early autumn from the se.a- 
 sons available for planting; and yet it does not, and 
 that for various reasons. At the period to which we 
 have referred, there is much warmth in the soil, and 
 as the perfected sap is then descending from the 
 leaves, the growth of roots commences rapidly and 
 goes on to a considerable extent, in which case the 
 plant is soon out of danger. Then there is often clou 
 dy and dripping weather, after the turn of the day, 
 as it is called, and every one must have remarked 
 the greater geniality of that season in regard to 
 growth, as compared with spring. Besides, in tho 
 spring months, the soil is colder and the atmosphere 
 is drier than in autumn; as may be seen from the ta- 
 ble on the opposite page. 

The conclusions to be derived from those tables 
 plainl}' point out autum I as t.ie best period fi)r the 
 transplanting of evergreens; and yet, when rightly 
 considered, they admit of that wide range of time 
 which actual experience authenticates. We beleive 
 that evergreens, in small quantities, have been safely 
 transpKanted from midsumm.er to the end of April 
 perhaps we might .say the whole ye.ir round. This 
 has occurred from a compensation of advantages and 
 disadvantages. Take August, for example: the air is 
 then drier than it is two months later, but the soil is 
 warmer; and if the plants escape a blazing sun for a 
 few days, the growth of roots will commence, and 
 will very speedily supply to theloa<-es all tho perspi- 
 rable matter that is needed. Thus, an equilibrium 
 of action is rapidly established. 

Depth op the Roots of Trees. — In the spring of 
 1850, I removed an apple tree wnich was growing on 
 a gravelly ridge, to a piece prepared for it a short dis- 
 tance from whence it was taken. The tree was six 
 inches in diameter, had b^en planted, I should judge, 
 about twenty years, and had been top-grafted a few 
 days previous to its removal. The tree and most of 
 the grafts set in it are growing thriftily. 

In the place where the tree stood, I sunk a well, 
 and in the digging traced the roots of the apple tree 
 downwards to a depth of over twelve feet below tho 
 surface of the ground. My attention was called by 
 the appearance of the roots, as tho workmen were 
 going on with their work, and a measurement was 
 made, llow much deeper the roots could have been 
 traced, I cannot tell, but I was well satisfied that 
 they did extend some little below the measurement 
 From the great loss of roots, by their spreading so 
 deep and wide, I had little expectation of saving my 
 tree, and still less the grafts so recently set, hut was 
 most agreeably disappointed,in both. — R. N. Yorker.
