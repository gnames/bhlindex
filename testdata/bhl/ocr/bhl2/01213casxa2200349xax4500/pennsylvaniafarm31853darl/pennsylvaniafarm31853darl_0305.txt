HigU Prices of Improved Stock. 

The uiiprecodentcd prices, butli in England and 
 the United States, obtained the present season at tlic 
 public sales of cattle and sheep, are well calculated 
 to startle a plain, matter of fact farmer, who is apt 
 to value an animal according to his worth for the 
 butcher, and to induce the inquiry, is not this all 
 mere speculation ? Is a Bull ever really worth $3 
 or $4000, and will he at this figure ever pa}', taking 
 into consideration ordinary risks and accidents. 

It must be oonsideiyd that, in the present extraor- 
 dinary state of prosperity in the country, there are 
 many things going off at speculative or fancy prices 
 besides Durhams. Any expansion of the medium of 
 exchanges, whether of the precious metals or bank 
 paper, has a tendency to induce speculation and raise 
 the price, not only of Durham stock, but Railroad and 
 Bank stocks, real estate and every thing else, having 
 either real urj'ancicd value. This does not by any 
 means depend on the fact of the valuation being 
 either real or fictitious, as we see daily fluetuations 
 in our large cities in inveslments, wUero ccciy thing is 
 assumed, the market price depending on the relative 
 daily or hourly scarcity of money, and the business con- 
 dition of large commercial centres. A common brick 
 may be taken up and used as well as any thing else for 
 akind of medium of speculation, an assumed value of 
 n few thousands put upon it, and passed from hand to 
 to hand. raising or lowering in price by operation of ex- 
 trinsic causes, knocked about like a shuttle, till sud- 
 denly the bublile bursts, and the brick comes back a 
 mere bricK, to its starting point. The tulip mania 
 ia Holland and the multicaulis humbug here were 
 cases of this kind, neither o( thera having any real val- 
 ue comparatively. The tulip bulb was worth a few 
 cents, and the multicaulis also, as a shade tree, but 
 the high prices, at which they were sold, were 
 f unded on a false basis, and the latter particularly 
 on wrong deductions as to the capacity of the United 
 States to be a silk growing country. Now are the 
 present high prices of blooded stock to be viewed in 

the same light? Is there no real, intrinsic value {ft 
 Durhams and Southdowns on which to predicate the 
 enormous rates they have been selling at, and to 
 some extent justify them? Admit these arc to soma 
 extent speculative, just as other articles of purchasB 
 and sale at the present time, still when business, 
 now inflated, shall revert to its ordinary level, will 
 there not then bo iound to be a substantial value re- 
 maining? This, we think, is the true view to b'o 
 considered, and in doing so it is not necessary ti) 
 agitate the question as to thcmerits of the Durhafti 
 breed; that has long been before the farming public, 
 and it may be considered a settled point, that in ceW 
 tain particulars, as a breed, they are unrivalled, anil 
 their superiority to any other known is a generally 
 admitted fact. 

The expediency and profitableness ol any one buy- 
 ing a bull for $3 or $4000 isa matter for his personal 
 consideration only. In a district of country whci*Â© 
 raising of stock is extensively followed, and in thft 
 present high times, a superior bull, where his strarti 
 of blood was particularly valued or very scarce, 
 serving 30 or 40 cows, annually, at ?25, $50 or $106 
 each, would soon remunerate his purchaser, and iti 
 Kentucky, Ohio and Now York, these prices woultj 
 be cheerfully paid for the opportunity of obtaining n 
 desirable cross. Indeed, the benefit to a whoFe 
 neighborhood or district from the introduction of Ik 
 superior animal may, in Ihis way, bo almost inoal- 
 culiible; neither would his purchase bo any mote 
 purely speculative than an ^p?ration in real estate, 
 in any of our large cities, during a rising maikct, 
 where $-0, $30 and $40,000 are given for a few 
 square feet of ground, not worth under ordinary cir- 
 cumstances more than half the money. The market 
 value of any thing is very much regulated by the 
 extent of supply. At the recent sales, where such 
 enormous prices have been paid for first choice ani- 
 niali, it will be observed to have boon on account of 
 some particular strain of Ijlood or pedigree. Somo' 
 rare points of form or character which tho oxperi-
