»Iso struck with the disparity above alluded to by 
 ■our correspondent, and on the a; pearance of the en- 
 graving in the Horticulturist, wrote immediately to 
 ■our friend. Dr. Brinckle, from whom we received the 
 drawing. la his reply he says -. 

"The McAvoy's Superior figured byyou is genuine, 
 and an exact representation of the specimen which 
 ■was grown by Mr. Cope. In our ad interim report, 
 we describe the form as being rouitdish ovate; I 
 have never seen the fruit round •except in small 
 specimens. Hovey, in the last number of his Maga- 
 zine, page 401, says: "the description by the Penn- 
 sylvania Horticultural Society of the former (Mc- 
 Avoy'e Superior) agrees with ours; with one excep- 
 tion it could not be more correctly described; that 
 exception is the color; their report calls it deep, bril- 
 liant, crimson, while w« call it a dark, dingy red." 

I h-ave seen specimens ttiie season grown by Mr. 
 Buist, as well as by Mr. Cope; and I have fruited it 
 myself from a plant sent by mail from Mr. Long- 
 ivorth io 1850."

Can you inform one of your eubscri- 
 ters and constant readers, where he can obtain a 
 good Shepherd Dog, of pure blood, and four to six 
 months old. What is your opinioa of their value as 
 a farmers dog. J. L.

We are well acquainted with the Scotch Collev 
 breed of Shepherd Dogs, and consider them very val 
 uable to a farmer. We have owned several- They 
 make excellent watch dogs, and are trained without 
 much difficulty to bring up th« cows, watch or herd 
 the sheep, and save many a trip of a man or boy in 
 this way. We know where an excellent pup of a- 
 bout the age wanted, can he obtained at a reasonable 
 price. — Ed. 

Small vs. liarge Potatoes. 

In the patent office report for 1852 and '53, which 
 has just reached us, there are many veryvaluablecom- 
 munieations, in the agricultural department of great 
 interest to the firmer. In one of the reports from 
 Maine, by William Upton, Jr., we extract the fol- 
 lowing, which agrees with the experience of many 
 others in respect to the use of large and ripe potatoes 
 for seed. Whatever may be the original cause of 
 the rot, it is reasonable to infer that the immature 
 seed would be more liable to be affected, as was 
 found in this case, although we do not, recollect to 
 have heard before of the same experiment. His 
 letter says : 

Till the prevalence r,{ the potato rot, this was a 
 very important crop for this State, not only as a feed 
 for cattle and hogs, but as an article of export; and, 
 next to the hay crop its failure may be considered : 
 the severest calamity that could befall the farmers of ' 

this State, and its cause and cure have thus far baf- 
 fled f'e researches of the scientific and the practical; 
 though I think its ravages may be somewhat abated 
 by the observance of certain rules in planting. Se- 
 lect, if possible, dry land in good heart, turn the 
 grass under the fall before, and plaBt as early in the 
 spring as the ground can be worked, without manu- 
 ring; and in th'i selection of seed, reject iiU small, 
 affected potatoes, planting none but those of good 
 size, fair, and suitivble for the table. It is a prcv.xil- 
 ing opinion — and one I consider very erroneous — 
 that small potatoes are just as good to plant as large 
 ones, and, if the theory is true, better, for they will 
 go over more ground. On an experiiaent I tried 
 three or four years ago, it was found that where five 
 or six bushels of good, selected Carter potatoes were 
 planted in the midst of a field of the same variety of 
 potatoes, unselected, but in other respects planted 
 under precisely the same circumstances, scarcely one 
 of the product of the f rmer was found in the least 
 affected with the rot, while of the product of the lat- 
 ter at least one-third was more or less affected. The 
 Carters are generally considered the most palatable 
 — at the same tim; they are probably the most sub- 
 ject to the rot of any potato of this region. The long 
 red potato is considered the most prolific, Aveia^e 
 potato crop, about 2O0 bushels per acre. 

The culture of the carrot, turnip, and beet, has 
 considerably increased since the prevalence of the 
 potato rot, and they are usually considered profita- 
 ble. Probable average of carrot crop, GOO bushels 
 per acre. 

liime V. Potato Disease. 

At the beginning of August last, I had a bed of 
 ripe walnut-leaved Potatoes dug, the produce of 
 which amounted to three bushels. Conceiving the 
 disinfecting propei ties of lime might lie advantigo- 
 iiusly employed in checking the progress of the dis- 
 ease, then slightly manifesting itself, I resolved on 
 sprinkling a handful on every alternate layer of Po- 
 tatoes in the bushel, extending the experiment to 2 
 bushels only, .and storing the remaining one in a 
 dry state without any application. On examining 
 ttiem a week ago, I was gratified at the discovery 
 th.at five Potatoes only were bad among the 2 bush- 
 els to which the lime was applied, while 2 gallons of 
 the other bushel were infected. To prevent the ef- 
 fect being attributed to any other agency than the 
 lime, it may bo stated that the whole of tlie ground 
 was planted with tubers of the same sample, and had 
 previously received similar treatment. I d'l ndt find 
 that the lime has, in any degree, affi'cted the quality 
 of the Potato.— fT. Sprent, Oocrton, Hept. 12. 

The Richest Mine. 

The m.anure applied to the soil of England amoun'g 
 to three hundred millions of dollars: being more than 
 the value of it« whole foreign commerce, and \etth6 
 grateful .soil yields back with interest all that is 
 lavished upon it. And so it wnuld Ije here, if we 
 would only trust the soil with any portion of our 
 capital. But this we rarely do. A firmer who has 
 made any money spends it not in his business, but 
 in some other occupation. He buys more land whco 
 he imght to buy more manure, or he puts out his 
 money in some joint-stock company to convert sua- 
 shiiio into moonshine. Ue!y upon it, our richest 
 mine is the barn yard, and whatever temptation 
 utock or shares may offer, the best investment for a 
 farmer is live stock and plougli shares. — Exchamjc.
