John Griggs advice to Vouug Men. 

From " Freedleif •■< practkal Treatise on Business." 
 "1. Be industrious and economiciil. Waste neitbor 
 timo ni)i- raonoy in small and itvetevs indulgences. If 
 the 3'i)ung can l)c induced to beffin to sace, tlie mo- 
 ment thev enter tlie paths of life, the way will ever 
 bee )Die easier before them, and they will notfiiil to at- 
 tain a couipetenc}', and tliat without denyinj; them- 
 selves any of the veal necessaries and comforts of 
 life. Our people are certainly among the most im- 
 provident a d e.'!travaf;ant on the face of the earth. 
 It is enou;.;h to make the merchant of the old school 
 who looks liack and thinks what economy, prudence 
 nn I discretion he had to bring bear on his own 
 business, (and which are in fict the bases of all 
 succssful enterprise,) start back in astonishment to 
 look at the ruthless waste and extravagance of the 
 age and people. The highest test of respectabilty, 
 wi h rae, is honest industrj'. Well-directed indus- 
 trp mikes men ha-'py. The really noble clas-i— the 
 class that was nolle when 'Adara delv'd and Eve 
 Fpuo,' and have pre-erved their patent to this day 
 untirnished, is the laborious and industrious. Un- 
 til msn have learned industry', economy, and self- 
 control, they cvnnot be safely entrusted with uealth. 

II. To industry and economy, add self-reliance. 
 Do n It take too much advice. The business man must 
 k"ep at the helm and steer his own ship. In early 
 life, every one should bo taught to think for himself. 
 A mill's talen'.s are never brought out until he is 
 thrown to some extent upon his own resources. If iu 
 every difficulty lie has only to run to his principal, 
 and then implicitly obey the directions he may re- 
 ceive, he will never acquire that aptitude of percep- 
 tion, and that promptness of decision, and that firm- 
 ness of purpose, which are absolutely necessary to 
 those who hold important stations. A certain de- 
 gree of ind pendent feeling is essential to the full 
 devil ipmcnt of the intellectual character. 

III. Uemember that punctuality is the mother of 
 confidence. It is not enough that the merchant ful- 
 fils his engagement : he must do what he undertakes 
 precisely at tkc time, as well as in the way he agreed 
 10. The huitual dependence of merchants is s i great, 
 that their engagmonts, like a chain, which, accord- 
 ing to the law of hysics, is never stonger than its 
 weakest link, are oftener broken through the weak- 
 ness of others than their own. But a prompt fulfil- 
 ment of engagements is not only of the utmost im- 
 portance, b 'Cause it enables o'hers to meet their own 
 engagements promptly. It is also the best evidence 
 that the merchant has his affairs well ord-red— his 
 meins at command, his forces marshalled, and 
 'eforyihing ready for action' — in short, that he knows 
 his own strength. This it is which inspires confi- 
 dence as much perhaps as the meeting of the engage- 
 ment. 

IV. Attend to the ;Hi/i»//(B of the business, small 
 as well as great. See that the store is opened early 
 goods liruslieJ up, twine and nails picked up, and 
 all leidy fir action. A yc ung man should consider 
 cap t il. if he have it, or as he may acquire it, merely 
 as to la with which he is ti work, not as a substitute 
 for the necessity (if lalior. Il is of ten the case that 
 dilii/ence in enijiloymo.t of less con-sequence is the 
 most .■mccessfnl iiilrocluiioa to the great entei-jirises . 
 Those make ths best officers who have served in the 
 ranks. We may say of labor, as Coleiidge said of 
 poetry, it is its own sweetest reward. It is the best 
 of physic. - ' 

\ . L"t the young liiorchant remember that selfish- 
 ness is the parent of vices, and it is the parent of a 

thousand more. It not only interferes both with the 
 means and with the end of acquisition — not only 
 makes money more difficult to get, and not worth 
 having when it is got but it is narrowing to the mind 
 and to the heart. Selfishness, keeps a shilling so 
 close to the eye, that it cannot see a dollar beyond.' 
 Never be narrow and contracted in your views. Life 
 abounds in instance) of the brilliant results of s 
 generous policy. 

Be frank. Say what you mean. Do whatyoa say. 
 So shall your friends known and take it for granted 
 that you mean to do what is just and right. 

YI. Accustom yourself to think vigorously. Men- 
 tal capital, like pecuniary to be worth anything must 
 be well invested, — must be rightly adjusted ar>d ap- 
 plied, and to this end, careful, deep and intense' 
 thought is necessary if great results are looked for. 

VII. Marry early. The man of business should 
 marry as soon as possible, after twenty- 1 wo or 
 twenty-three years of age. A woman of mind will 
 conform to the necessities of the day of small begin- 
 nings; and, in choosing a wife, a man should look at, 
 1st. The heart; 2d. The mind; &d. The person. 

VIII. Everything, however remote, that has any 
 bearing upon success, must be taken advantage of. 
 The business man should be continually on the watch 
 for information, and ideas that will throw light on 
 his path, and he should be an attentive reader of all 
 practical books, e-ipecially those relating to business, 
 trade, etc., as well as a patron of useful and ennob- 
 ling literature. 

5IX. Never forget a favor, fiir ingratitude is the bas- 
 est trait of a man's heart. Always honor your coun- 
 try and remember that our country is the very best 
 poor man's country in the world."

How to Kill Slugs. 

A correspondent of the Mark Lane Express give» 
 the following method of destroying slugs. It is 
 cheap; and will benefit the soil, though it may not 
 destroy the little pests: 

If you suspect slugs working above ground, (I 
 know nothing of their underground work, but I have 
 no doubt they work above ground at night in all 
 cases,) have you: land carefully examined by a trust- 
 worthy man, with a lantern, about one or two hours 
 after dark, on a moist and as warm a nighi as you 
 can find at the season of year; then having ascer- 
 tained that they are there, sow broadcast at night, 
 and the same sort of night, from 6 to 10 bushels of 
 quicklime per acre. Very likely you will have to 
 repeat the dose; and the head-lands should always 
 he dune twice, as the hedges and banks harbor them. 
 The expense is but trifling. Two men, the lime 
 having been previously deposited iu convenient 
 places, will easily sow 8 acres per night before 12 
 o'clock. I gave them rather more than I should for 
 the same hours of day work, and about two quarts 
 of ale each night, and they (I always employ the 
 same two) are responsible for looking at the lands I 
 suspect. I once had to sow 8 acres of mangel three 
 times, the head-lands four times, and saved the crop, 
 which turned out remarkably good. This year I 
 sowed 2-1 acres of wheat twice in the autumn, and 8 
 acres of it again in the spring. 

Another correspondent thus effectually prevents 
 all future depredations, at least from those which ho 
 catches: 

Strew some fresh cabbage, lettuce, or other succu- 
 lent leaves, near the scene of action, and visit your 
 leaves every moTning, when you will find {;r jat nuok-
