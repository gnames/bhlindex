bera of them, who have been out on the feed all 
 night, taking temporary shelter under the leaves, 
 when they may easily be caught and dealt with ac- 
 cording to discretion. I have caught many bushels 
 of them in this way in my garden, and I now find 
 it pays me well to use the same trap on a large scale 
 on my farm.

The Dujjs of St. Bernard. 
 Most of our readers are aware that the passage of 
 the Alps between Switzerland and Savoy are the 
 most dangerous of the whole range of the natural 
 "cloud cap'd towers; ' and that on the slight table- 
 land afforded on the top of the Great St. Bernard an 
 hospice has stood for ages. It is supported by the 
 voluntary contributions of all nations. Catholic and 
 Protestant, Musselman and Hindoo, Christian and 
 Pagan, all find here a neutral ground for the flow of 
 that charity which difference of creed, or race, or 
 clime, can never wholly dry up. And truly it is a 
 noble institution — -for the hospitable, monks, though 
 their revenue is scanty, open their doors to every 
 stranger that presents himself. And that is by no 
 means a rare occurrence, for in these loity regions 
 the traveller is often overtaken by the most severe 
 weather, even after days of cloudless weather, when 
 the glaciers glitter in the sunshine; and the pink 
 rhododendrons appear as if they were never to bo 
 sullied by the tempest. On these dreadful occasions, 
 the storm comes on with the swiftness of lightning, 
 drifts of snow choke up the roads, and dreadful a>^a- 
 lanches sweep into the valleys, carrying trees and 
 fragments at roots before them. In these scenes of 
 awful grandeur they mingle, doing their sacred, God 
 like ministry. They devote themselves to the dan- 
 gerous task of searching for those unhtippy persons 
 who may have been overtaken by the sudden storms; 
 and thay are assisted in these sacred offices by a 
 breed of dogs peculiar to the establishment, and 
 whose renown is as universal as that of the chival- 
 rous monks. The sagacity of these animals is re- 
 markable. When the traveller, benumbed with cold, 
 and wearied in his search for the lost track, yields to 
 the stupifying influences of frost, and sinks to the 
 ground for the snow drift to cover him — it is then 
 that the exquisite docility and keen scent of these 
 admirable dogs is called into action. They are sent 
 out in pairs, and though the perishing man be twen- 
 ty feet heneath the snow, the delicacy of smell with 
 which they can trace him, offers a chance of escape. 
 They scratch away the snow with their feet, then set 
 up a hoarse aoii solemn bark, which brings the 
 monks and laborers of the convent to their assistance. 
 To provide for the chance that the dogs, without hu- 
 man help, may succeed in saving the unfortunate 
 traveller, one of them has a flask of spirits round his 
 neck, to which the fainting man may apply for sup- 
 port, and the other has a cloak to cover him. The 
 dog of the great St. Bernard, a spot 8000 fe t above 
 the level of ihe sea, is, indeed, a beautiful and won- 
 derful animal. lie belongs to the spaniel breed, but 
 is peculiarly large and powerful, particularly high 
 upon the leg<, and generally of a milky white, or tali- 
 by color. The breed having been cultivated with 
 immense care and assiduity for such a number of 
 years, and natural faculties of this fine specimen of 
 the dog having been sharpened^by generations of 
 training and experience, it is not surprising that 
 their intelligenc; should be so highly developed, that 
 actually a kind of language has 'jeen establishe 1 be- 
 tween tliem and the monks. The instinctive intel- 
 ligence of these dogs is shown by the curious fact, 

that if a whelp be placed upon the snow for the first 
 time, it will begin to scratch, and snuff about as if 
 in search of something. As in the human commu- 
 nity, so in the canine, there are degrees of excell- 
 ence; and among the dogs of the Great St. Bernard 
 this rule is strikingly apparent. The ^agaoity of 
 some of the dogs is absolutely astonishing. 

Ram-I.etting. 

The practice of letting male animals is very com- 
 mon in England. It has many advantages, and we 
 should be glad to see it adopted in this country. 
 The following from the Mark- Lane Express, explains 
 thd benefits of the system, so far as relates to shoept 

"It is the peculiar province of ram-breeders to 
 breed stock rams for the use of common flock-breed- 
 ers; and this mode of breeding has many advantages 
 to both parties. The ram-breeder can afford to pro- 
 cure and put to his flock of ewes better animals, and, 
 of course, more expensive ones than would answer 
 the purpose of an ordinary breeilor to use. In this 
 way the ram-breeder is ena"ljled to keep up a more 
 select and valuable flock, from which he can let or 
 sell animals of a truly valuable character to breed- 
 ers L.T common use at a lowerrate of prices; besides, 
 it is also his peculiar province to look out for and in- 
 troduce every practical improvement into his flocb 
 of which it is capable, by judicious selection from 
 the flocks of other approved breeders, and in a great 
 measure regardless of cost; the district depending up- 
 on him, expects these things of him; and if ho ia a 
 man of judgment he will not fail them. He knows, 
 or ought to know, the pedigree of every animal of 
 his flock; and in this way ho can and does suit any 
 chan:e of blood or feature to the wants of the flock. 
 In this way he can also suit his friends or customers 
 desiring or finding it requisite to change their blood 
 or intermingle it in their flock; by his peculiar flock- 
 marks he can on application recommend this and 
 the other animal as changes from the usual selection 
 of his friends, thereby rendering it unnecssary for 
 them to resort to other breeders, which is at all 
 times a dubious course to adopt; it is far better to 
 keep to a flock you well know, and to the judgment 
 of a breeder on whom you can depend: the breeding 
 will not be running too cbse by following this prao-i 
 tice." — [Boston Cjltivator. •*

Seed Corn. 

Now is the time to select ears of corn for seed. — 
 Go into the fields and pluck off the earliest ears and 
 such as are well filled; and you will gain something 
 by selfcting from stalks that have two ears on them. 
 It is important that you select in the field and beforo 
 all the ears are hard, for thus you will gain several 
 days in the ripening next year. 

We think it probable that a majority of our far- 
 mers neglect to select their seed ears till the time of 
 husking. But then they cannot determine certainly 
 whether they take the earliest ears. 

Corn is so important a crop, and so much of it is 
 often lost by early frosts, that it is of much conse- 
 quence to plant that which will ripen early. Wo 
 cannot urge the planting of the small Canada corn 
 in our latitude, for it is better to loose occasionally 
 part (jf a large crop than to bo always limited to a 
 small one. We need not go north fir seed oars if wo 
 will take a little care at the right time and select tho 
 ears which first come to maturity. Many farmers 
 know tlio importance of taking for seed what ripenj 
 earliest, but tliey are apt to forget and neglect.—
