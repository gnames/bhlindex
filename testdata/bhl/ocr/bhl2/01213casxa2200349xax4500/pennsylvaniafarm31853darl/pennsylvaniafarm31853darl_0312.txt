C« re for Glanders. 

I have lately discovered a remedy to cure Ihe Glan- 
 ders in a horse; I thought it might be useful to oth- 
 ers, and aceordinftly I send you the information. 
 Some time in May last a man drove up and fastened 
 his horses by mine, and came into the store; after- 
 wards we both went out, and I saw that one of 
 his horses wai sick. He said his horse hadjhe p;Ian- 
 flcrs, and that he thouglit it would have died 'ast night 
 It was so sick. I was offended because he had tied 
 his horses so near mine with a contagious disease, 
 and said no more to iiim. Some days after this the 
 matter being somewhat forgotten, I was passing 
 near my horse; he appeared to be sick; I turned and 
 went up to him, and, sure enough, he was sick! 
 Ills throat was swollen to a terrible degree, so he 
 could hardly raise or lower his head more than an 
 Inch or two. Something must be done, for 1 could 
 not part with him any way at present. I tried one 
 thing and another, but all to no purpose. Now for 
 dGtudy. What will do the thing? Glanders; what 
 are the glanders? Why,Jt is diseased glands; the 
 little vessels that bring the saliva to the mouth and 
 throat are disenssd — stopped up, and must be opened. 
 What will do it? Tobacco will vomit, and may open 
 Ihcm. I took a half a pound of fine cut tobacco and 
 poured two quarts of warm water on it, and let it 
 ^oak a few minutes, and washed his throat and so on 
 up to his ears, and down his throat to liis legs and 
 Ijetween his lore legs. It made him direful sick, 
 ftnd would have vomited him if it had been possible 
 for a horse to vomit. In three hours I bathed him 
 ftga\n, and the next morning again. The iinal effect 
 WIS, my horse could put his head to tlie ground 
 ftfter second time batliing, and after the third time 
 he could feed as well as over, .nnd is widl, and has 
 done better ever since. WM. MeSilEPARD.

White Sheep SUius for Door M its. 

Take two loncr-wooled sheep skins, and make up a 
 strong lather of soap; the signs of proper strength 
 Is when the lather iecls slippery between the fingers. 
 When the lather is cold, wash the s-kins care- 
 fully in it, squeezing tlieui between the liand ■ so as 
 to take all the dirt out of the wool. AVhen this is ac- 
 Ciomplishcd, lift out tlie skins and wash them in cold 
 Vater until all the soap is extracted. Have a vessel 
 of clean cold water ready, to which some alum and 
 salt, (about half a pound) which liave been dissolved 
 In a small quantity of hot water, are added, and the 
 ekins left to steep all night. They are taken out in 
 the morning and hung over a pole to dry. When 
 all the alum water has dripped off they are spread 
 Out on a board to dry, and carefully stretched with 
 the hand from time to time. Before they are thor- 
 oughly dry, a composition of two table spoon- 
 fuls of alum, and the same of saltpetre, are ground 
 to powder, in a mortar or otherwise, and sprinkled 
 Carefully on the flesh side ot each skin. Tliey are 
 then placed the one on thetopof theotlier.leaving the 
 wool outside, and hung upon arackof salts, in a barn, 
 ^hcd, or dry airy place, for about three days, or un- 
 til they are dry — they should be turned every day. 
 After this they are taken dc.wn and the flesh side 
 Scraped with a blunt knife; and each skin trimmed 
 for a mat. The flesh side may then be rubbed over 
 with pipe clay, beat with a switch, and will then be 
 found supple, of a beautiful white color, and fit for a 
 ^oor mat for a mechanic or prince. — Scientijic A-
