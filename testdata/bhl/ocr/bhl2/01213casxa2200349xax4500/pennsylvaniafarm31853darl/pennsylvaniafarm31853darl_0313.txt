ence to the number of Poultry to be acooVnmodivted' 
 The above dimensions are large enough for 150 to 
 200 barn door fowls. The materials for rear and 
 ends may be frame, brick or stone. The south slope 
 of an cmljankment will be a good loeation, as warmth 
 is an important point to be gained. The best mate- 
 rial for roof is straw thatch; this is warm in winter 
 and coul in eurcmcr. 

FIG. 1, represents the front view. A A A A are 
 glass lights 8 by 10 inches; the dotted lines show 
 where the edges of the glass meet each other. B B 
 B are boards three inches wide, nailed horizontally 
 to upright posts, the upper edge being plowed to re- 
 ceive the lower end of the glass, and the lower edge 
 rabbeted to receive the upper edge of the range of 
 glass immediately below, wliich is secured by putty. 
 This arrangement is original and saves the expense 
 of sash. C C, ventilators, may be made to slide in 
 grooves, or hung on hinges. D D D, doors : If the 
 length of the building does not exceed twenty or 
 thirty feet, one of the large doors may be dispensed 
 with. That portion of the front not compo.sed of 
 glass and doors to be weather-boarded. It will bo 
 better if the inside of all the walls are plastered. 

FIG. 2, represents an end view. C, ventilator, E, 
 nest boxes, 5 feet long, and 2 feet wide, entrance 
 open at botli ends, with a s oping lid hung on hinges 
 for the purpose of taking out eggs. Each box to be 
 divided into five compartments, with an open passage 
 next to the wall, the whole length. These boxes to 
 be placed against the front wall, immediately below 
 the glass; also across each end. ' F represents 
 the ends of the roosting poles, four ranges of wliioli, 
 to run the whole length of the building. These 
 poles should be IG inches apart. 

The space between the nest boxes and roosting 
 poles is intended as a winter promenade and lor feed- 

ing and watering troughs. The object to be obtain- 
 ed by so much glass, in front, is warmth by the sun 
 in winter. A clover yard should be attached for an 
 out door range in fair weather. 

Ci ustructiuu of Ice Houses. 

A house to preserve ice during our long dry sum- 
 mers, should be built with care, but need not be 
 very expensive. 

The best soil on which to build, is one ti'at is suffi- 
 ciently porous to allow the water to leach through 
 without the necessity ol using a drain, as this makes 
 way for a current ol air which tends to equalise the 
 temperature within, to that without. If the soil re- 
 quires a drain, the outer end should be closed up that 
 air currents cannot penetrate the interior. 

Choose a shady situation if convenient, and if the 
 soil is porous, excavate three or four feet, ten or 
 twelve feet square, lay down scantling and cover with 
 rough boards for a floor. Upon thisereet thestudding 
 2 liy 8 in stutt'8 feet hing, at distances of 3 feet apart, 
 if inch boards are used tor cover. The covering boanis 
 should be well seasoned so as to make tight joints. 
 The outer wall, as high as the suilaeeof the ground, 
 may be nailed on tlie studs before they are set down 
 upon the floor. Board up on both sides of the studs 
 to the top, and back the earth around the outer wall, 
 leaving it to descend in all directions to carry off the 
 surface water; then fill up the space between the 
 boards (8 inches) to the top of the wall (8 feet) with 
 fine charcoal, dry saw-dust or tan hark well packed 
 down. When the space is filled, nail a strip of boards 
 nicely over the top to prevent rats or niiei^ from bur- 
 rowing within. Upon this tho rafters may be allow- 
 ed to rest or the roof may be made ol whole boards, 
 running up to the ridge, and battened; in either case 
 the roof should project well over the wall on all sides. 
 the entrance door should be on the north side, no 
 larger than is absolutely necessary — say 2§ feet wide 
 and 4 feet high. The entrance should be protected 
 by double doors, the outer cmo opening outwards tho 
 other inwards, each set flush with their respective 
 walls, and fitting closely, leaving an air chamber of 
 8 inches between thiiu. 

When all this is done it will pay to set another
