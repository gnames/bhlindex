 before the ground freezoa up, nnd the growth will 
 commence again as soon a:i the frost leaves the ground 
 in the spring, which will cunlinue throtigliout the 
 ■whole season, of about twelve months; whereas, when 
 Sown in the spring they can grow only eight or nine

The report of a committee. No. 34, on miacella- 
 neous articles not having been acted on by the ex' 
 ecutive committee, will not be made known for afe\f 
 days. 

J?rpor/ nf the Committee on Putillrii. Kn. 1.5. 

The Committee in submitting the fdlowing report, 
 congratulate the Society (ipuu the very large and 
 beautiful display of poultry on exhibition. — Must of 
 the fowls give evidence of careful breeding, showing 
 a commendable feeling of interest, in regard to thi? 
 department of domestic agriculture. The carliness 
 of the season, and the fiict that a large raajurtty of 
 of the fowls are of the present year's raising, hiva 
 rendered them less attractive in plumage, and pre- 
 vented that fine develojiraent of size, so marked a tea-" 
 ture at the last exhibition. 

From the immense number of fowls, the neglect toi 
 number the coops in regular numerical order, and 
 the almost total disregard of system on the part of 
 some of the exhibitocs, in cooping and arranging 
 them, have all served, not only to largely increase 
 the the labors of the Commitee, but to prevent as 
 complete a report as would otherwise have been pre* 
 pared. 

The.se defects in the present arrangement will, the 
 committee hope, bo a sufficient apology for the ;/c«C' 
 ral character ol the report, as well as serve to correct 
 the evil at the future exhibitions. Hid each coop 
 been properly nnrahercd, the particular fowls tcr 
 which the rcijnlar pemiums of the Society have been 
 awarded, as well as these for which the committeef 
 recommend sjjccial or discretionary awards, would 
 have liecn more readily recognized by visitors, and 
 the intentions of the committee more f 'lly understood. 
 Regretting the in.idvertenee, the committee beg leava 
 to submit the following awards of premium:
