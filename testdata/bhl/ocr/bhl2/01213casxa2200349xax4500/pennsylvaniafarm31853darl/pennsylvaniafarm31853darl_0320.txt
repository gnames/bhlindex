CU inge of Timbers from c caring Iiiiiids. 

Tliere arc few things connected vfith the natural 
 history ot trees or plants more surprising, or that 
 have uccasioneii more spccuhition, than the chan;^es 
 that not uufi-equently talic phtc' in the growth of 
 limber after clearing, from what it was licforo t :at 
 operation. So inexplicable is this change, in many 
 instances, on the commonly received principles of ve- 
 getation, that it has Ijcen adduced by tlie believers 
 in the doctrine of spimtaneous production, as one of 
 tlie strongest supporters ol their system. We think, 
 however, lliat, singular as the phenomenon may be, 
 its scdulion cannot require a supposition so unphilo 
 sophical. 

In the Southern States, where timber is principal- 
 iy pine, when that is cleared (jfF, a growth entirely 
 different, and composed ot such as was entirely un- 
 known to the place bcf^ore it, springs up: and this, 
 when cut off, is succeeded by now varieties, or per- 
 haps by a return id pine. Lands covered with oak 
 and chesnut, or such timber .as shoots up in m cut 
 trees do not change the timber e-tcept in a small de- 
 gree. It is on those lands covered with timber that 
 requires to be propagatcil by seeds that this chtinge 
 is nio-it apparent. Everybody mtisthave noticed in 
 what numbers a species of wild cherry will spring up 
 wtiere forests are cut down, or are propagated by 
 winds, though that particular kinil is rarely or never 
 found growing in the unbroken forest. 

More than thirty years since, a part, of our farm 
 Was cleared of its'timber, a dense growth of maple, 
 bass Wood and elm. A small piece of perhaps half 
 nn acre was separated from the rest by a narrow ra- 
 vine; after being cultivated three or four years, and 
 part of it planted out as a nursery of fruit trees, it 
 Was left to itself. It was soon covered with young 
 trees, which were suffered to grow unmolested, tind 
 there are now on this small spot, white oak, black 
 oak, butternut, white poplar, common willow,^ wal- 
 nut, hickory and black cherry, of a.l varieties of 
 which not one was growing near at the time it was 
 cleared, and most of them not within threofonrths 
 of a mile. An explanation we leave to others. — [ War-

Cut YonrD.tches and Cut your Baalies, 

Earmerg a e exclaiming '-how dry it is I" True, 
 it is dry, but you can't help it; anil the best thing 
 you can do is" to take the best advantage of it thiit 
 you can. Have you a bog or a low piece of land 
 that you want to reclaim, and put into a profitable 
 Cultivation? Now is the time to ditch it— to cut off 
 the bushes^-grub up the "tussacs" and brake up 
 roots, and put into complete order by purifying it 
 with fire and sowing on a good supply of i'ovil mead- 
 ow grass seed, &c. 

Have you a muck or peat bed? Now is the time 
 to draw a supply of material to increase j-our ma- 
 nure heap— or, if you have not time to haul it to 
 ,Vour barn now, ( mploy some good hand to dig out 
 and pile it up in a situation where the water will 
 not roach it, and during good sledding next Winter, 
 you can get it up and have it ready for another sea- 
 son. The dry weather may thus be made useful to 
 jou. A farmer, by a little calculation, can find 
 work appr)priate for all weathers. — Maiitc Fanner.

Paint Yopr Tools.— Every farmer should be pro- 
 vided with a small qimntity of the c arser kinds of 
 paint — a few pots and brushes and paint, oil. and 
 should keep his carts, wagons, sleds, plows, liarrows, 
 &c., well coated with paint. 

Turnips. 

Turnips mixy remain in the field till late. TlieV 
 are far leas injured by frost than many are inclined 
 to believe. It is very often the case that turnip? are 
 froZim in the ground, and on the frost breaking up 
 again in the course of a few days, are i-onioved as 
 hard and crisp as before. The action of the soil 
 neutralizes its effects, and sometimes a suceesion of 
 several weeks of warm weather, after A freezing 
 night, adds as much to the weight and value of the 
 crop as they gained in twice that time before the ail- 
 vent of severe cold. A low temperature is favoralile 
 rather than adverse to the development of all the 
 species of the turnip tribe. Cabbages grow rapidly 
 in cold weather; hence the practice so prevalent at 
 present of allowing them to remain out till the snow 
 falls. In packing turnips of all kinds, care should 
 betaken to secure them efTi^olually against the light 
 and air. The more perfe 'tly this is accomplished, 
 the greater will be the cert.ainty of their keeping 
 well, and the more wholesome and nutritive will they 
 lie found, both for stock and for table use. — iV. £,
