I claim first, the use of the circular p;uifle ways, in 
 combination with the moveable ]>iers or bearings, 
 and the cams or levers or other suitable means of 
 movinn; the same simultaneously and equally aliin<^ 
 said circular guide ■n'ays, so that the saws or other 
 cutteis may be instantaneously aljusted for any re- 
 quireJ width of stave without stopping their motion 
 or changing their direction towards a constant cen- 
 tral point. 

Second, I claim the use of the wing orleaf guage, 
 in combination wiih the ind;x moving over a grad- 
 uated arc or dial, both moving in connection with 
 the sawa, so as to indicate at a glance the width 
 between the saws, and to guide the operator in set- 
 ting the stave on its bed plate and in adjusting the 
 saw.s. 

Third, I claim the mode of jointing staves to any 
 required bilge and bevel without bending or spring- 
 ing them liy rotating them endwise, in a plane per- 
 pendicular" to their width, between saws or other 
 cutters, so inclined as to give the correct bevel, 
 whether adjustable as above or not, said rotation be- 
 ing upon a circle or other proper cur^e, su"h as to 
 present each part of the stave to the action of the 
 inclined cutters at the precise point or height reciui- 
 site to give it its exact proportionate width or bilge, 
 the rotation being obtained by means of a central 
 arch piece moving ovor rollers about a constant cen- 
 tre of motion, as described.

On Baisiug Potatoes From Seed. 

By William Pann, Burlinoion Co., N. J. 
 Having derived mucli pleasure and information from 
 reading accounts of the experiments recorded in the 
 Horticulturist, I feel it right to contriliute what little 
 lays in my power towards the general good, in part 
 return for tlie benefits which I have received from 
 the experience of others. 

The potato being so valuable an esculent, every 
 pr:caution should be used to extend its usefulness, by 
 increasing the varieties and testing the merits uf 
 each, as well in quality as quantity produced, that 
 those widch prove superior, either in early ripening 
 or adaptation to particular soils or climate, may be 
 disseminated throughout the country, and_ those 
 which arc inferior be discarded from cultivation. 

The usual mode of raising potatoes from the .wf(?, 
 by planting in the open garden, beingtedious and re- 
 quiring several years to develop their true characters, 
 has deTerred many from the undertaking. The seed 
 require a long time to vegetate, and the growth being 
 slow thereafter, noxious weeds and grass get the 
 start and become very troublesome ; the plants attain 
 but a diminutive size early in the season, which is 
 the most favoralde time for their growth ; the tuberj 
 do not set until the latter part of summer, whtn the 
 dry weather and parching rays ol the sun deck their 
 future growth, and tend to ripen the crcp beiore .t 

has attained much size, so that the pro duct of the 
 first year is very trifling, and several years are re- 
 quired to ascertain the trne qualities of the seedling 

Tlie great object, then, is to get the plants so ad- 
 vanced in the spring, that the tuliers may set and 
 grow in the early part of summer, when the refresh- 
 ing showers alternating with tlie genial rays of the 
 sun are mos' favorable for their growth. 

The plan that iias succeeded well with me for se- 
 veral years past, is as follows: Soon after the ripen- 
 ing of the potato tops, I gather the balls of the —• 
 Mercer potato, mashed them together, threw on a flj 
 little water and left them a few days to ferment, when ■ 
 the seed were easily ^parated from the pulp and 
 husk, and after being dried were placed away 3?eure 
 from frost or moisture, to remain unti spring for 
 planting. The latter part of the third month the 
 seed were sow^d in a hot-bed under glass, the grains 
 being sown a quarter of an inch asunder. From the 
 raiddlu to the latter part of the filth month, the plants 
 being three or four inches high, and frosty weather 
 appearing to be over, on damp cloudy days or soon 
 after a rain, the plants were taken up with a portion 
 of earth to each and placed in loose rich soil, at a- 
 bout the same distance from one another as potatoes I 
 are usually planted. •* 

The plants neither wilted nor showed any signs of 
 suffering from transplanting. 

It is of importance that they should be put down 
 into the eartli two inches lower than they stood in 
 the seed bod; they will thus produce more roots : but 
 care must be taken that the young plants do not pro- 
 duce tubers while they remain in the seed-bed, as 
 they will be very much weakened if allowed to do so 
 before they are put out. The earthing-up of the po- 
 tatoes laiaed from the seed, should be done early, and 
 not too heavily ; for if the plants are put out in wea- 
 ther which is not very favorable, they soon begin 
 to shoot up, and the entire soil is penetrated by very 
 small fine fibres, which would be injured by a high 
 or late earthing up, the production of tubers be de- 
 layed for a fortnight or three weeks, and the prodoeo 
 diminished. The potato plants thrive best in a rich 
 sandy soil which has been deeply dug. [Potatoes 
 should never be earthed up at all. Ed. 

By the aljove method I have raised full sized, mer- 
 chantable potatoes tlie first year from the seed; many 
 hills having liut three to five potatoes and all of a 
 fair size for market — others having a la^'ger amount 
 were proportionally smaller. By recurring to seed- 
 lings we may obtain a he ilthy arfcle free from r it or 
 any other disease, but I have no confidence that they 
 will long remain so after being exposed to the same 
 influence under which the parent stock has degen- 
 erated. 

The failure of the potato crop in many parts of 
 the country has induced fixrmers to experiment care- 
 fully in order to ascertain if possible in what situa- 
 tions or kinds of soils they generally suceed best, and 
 from what e.-sperience I have had, I am inclined to 
 the opinion, that where the land is clayey and tena- 
 cious, thereby holding the heavy rains in immediate 
 contact with "the tubers until the hot snn coming up- 
 on them, while thus thoroughly saturated with water, 
 completes their destructicm, drying and baking tho 
 ground ovor and around them, so as to exclude the 
 air ; that it they were so near ripe at the time as to 
 retain their form until harvested, they soon give way 
 after being exposed to atmospheric influence. Such 
 soil is unsuitaide for raising potatoes — and the same 
 cause that Inis heretofore prevented the cultivation 
 of the more delicate sweet potato on heavy land, now
