Special Manures fur Fruit Trees. 

Besides the more common and universal in.'^redi- 
 ents of soils, sand and clay, there are others more 
 essential to the growth of trees. Among the more 
 important of these are potash, lime, and phosphate 
 of lime. 

Now, whatever earthy in,2;redients are found in the 
 wood, bark, ,and fruit ot trees, must be derived from 
 the soil; and if the soil in which they are planted 
 docs n It contain all these ingredients, the trees can- 
 not flourish. It therefore becomes vitally important 
 to supply such defic enci s by the application of tho 
 particular or specific manure needed. 

But it is not to be expected that cultivators generally 
 will be able to an.alyze their variously differing soils, 
 nor to procure it done by a skilful chemist. Tlio 
 next thing, then, that can be accomplished is to as- 
 certain the component parts of the different kinds of 
 trees, wliieli are nearly the same in all localities. If 
 it is found that a particular species contains an un- 
 usual quantity of simio certain ingredients, wo may 
 safely conidude that such ingredients should be large- 
 ly siipplied as a manure. 

As instances, analysis has shown that the pear, 
 the apple, and the gra'^e, contain, <if 100 parts each 
 ot enrthff ingredients, the following proportions of 
 potash, lime, and phosphate of lime: —

Phosphate of lime, 17 3

Phnsphate of lime, 15 5 

The priuKirtions of these ingredients, iilthough not 
 exceeding the quantities found in simie other plants, 
 are so large as to show conclusively the importance 
 of a imipi'r supply in the soil. They already exist 
 in all soils adapted to the growth ot fruit trees, but 
 their small amount in particular localities, from na 
 tural deficiency, or fr m long oultivation, may ren 
 der their application a matter of the greatest impor- 
 tance. .Such application made be p-irtially made )iy 
 Common yard manure, which contains them in coti- 
 Kider;i,ble proportions; but wood ashes, in wliieh they 
 mostly e.tist in large quantities, will furnish them 
 more freely .and with a more speedy eflect; as from 

tho largo proportion of animal matter in yard ma- 
 nure, too much Eucculoncj of growth or even sur- 
 feit Would result from its abundant and exclusive ap- 
 plication, an evil in no wise resulting from tho uso 
 ot ashes. But over-doses, even of those, should bo 
 avoided. 

the large proportion of lime in the wood and barii 
 of the apple, indicates its vilue as a manure for fhi* 
 fruit; we accordingly find tliat leaahod .ashes, which 
 contain much liuic, are eminently useful. Leached 
 as well as ualjached ashes may "indeed bo apnliej 
 with groat ad^ant.age to all fruit trees. Bones eon- 
 tain much phosphate of lime, and, pulverized, they 
 Would undoubtedly in many cases produce an excel- 
 lent effect on the pear, and other species. 

Iron is found only in minute quantities in thi) 
 wood and bark of trees: yet the speedy restoration 
 from pale and sickly t, deep green and "luxuri.ant fo- 
 liage, by its application to the roots in some instan- 
 cos. proves that however small ita proportion may 
 be, its presence is essential. 

An interesting experiment is stated in the Ilorti- 
 culturist, upon a large pear tree, bearing blighted, 
 cr.acked .and worthless fruit, which resultedln ita 
 perfect restoration to health, and tho production of 
 smooth and fair crops. This change was affected by 
 digging, tliree feet distant from the tree, a circular 
 trench four feet wide and twenty inches deep; filling 
 this with fresh, rich soil ami turf, and intermingling 
 two bushels of scoria; from a blacksmith's for.'e^two 
 bushels of charcoal, and two pounds of potash. The 
 fresh soil and potash doubtless contribu'ed largely to 
 success. Other experiments of a similar ch.iracter 
 have been equally successful. 

Dr. Kirtland states that orchitrds on the limeslong 
 hills of Ohio, invarialdy afi'ord the best apples— a re- 
 mark fully corroborated by other observati<ms. Tho 
 same eminent cultivator gives the following account of 
 his success with specific manures : his pear trees on 
 worn out hand, made but iico to .?/.c inches growth in a 
 single season, and the fruit was blighted, knotteil, and 
 deficient in flavor. They soon began to exhibit evi- 
 dences of disease and old age. An analj'sis of the 
 soilwas made by Dr. Enimtms, indicating its d ■dc'.- 
 encies. Dressings of phosphate of lime, [in pulver- 
 ised bones,] ashes, and barnyard manure, with a 
 limited supply of common sail, cfFectod a comp'cto 
 renovation. 

The subject of special manures is d'cstined to be- 
 come one of groat interest to ci.ltivators. It is ye* 
 in its infancy. Many years of careful experinie'nt, 
 guided by patient and laborious analy.'ds, can only 
 carry it forward to maturity. But in"t!io meantime, 
 enough is knc wn to enable crchardists to operate in 
 many instances w th great advantage. Na always 
 knowing ihc deficient ingredient, they may not "at 
 once apply the precise remedy. But 'there are soma 
 manures that can never do injury, that will usually 
 be highly benefici;il, and so'mctimes yield ex- 
 traordinary r suits. To enable cultivators to ex- 
 periment with these the f.dlowing excellent practical 
 hints are given from the norticullurist, from the pen 
 of A. J. Downing, its editor: — 

• For old apple ondiards, upon soil deficient in 
 lime, we would recommend a t<.p dressing of lime — 
 — fiir the first time— of 200 bu-lio!s to the aero. 
 This will, usually, if tho land is iti gnoii condition, 
 bring tho trees into good bearing condition again. 
 In some soils, the efTi:ct will be immediate, and in' 
 others it will require one or two seasons for tho lime 
 to produce its efl'ect.
