^^PRACTICAL HINTS TO CULTIVATION OF PEARS ON QUINCE. [November 

■Kinked lime to each tree is sufficient. It is, perhaps, 
 best applied in the autumn, but it will answer very 
 well in the spring. Scatter it evenly over the sur- 
 face of the ground, a.s hir as the roots extend. It 
 may be ploughed or hoed under slightly, or left upon 
 the surface, as it will find its way downwards in the 
 .soil. 

"To keep an apple orchard in the fruit hcariar/ 
 • eondition, in a soil not calcareous, and'not naturally 
 congenial to the tree, it should be dressed with lime, 
 and with ashes, every alternate autumn, and m.a- 
 nured every other spring. The same quantity of 
 spent ashes as of lime, may be used for each tree. 

"For the pear tree, we prefer tlie following com- 
 post: Take a wagon load of peat, or bl.ack swamp 
 earth— dissolve iO lbs. of potash in water, and water 
 the peat thoroughly with the liquid. Let it lie a 
 couple of days, and it is fit for use. Or, for the 
 •same quantity of peat, use one-third of a load of 
 leached wood ashes, (or ten bushels of fresh ashes,) 
 mixing the whole, aud letting it lie a fortnight be- 
 fore using it. Give each middle sized bearing; tree, 
 ■a buKhel of this compost annually; a newly planted 
 young tree half a peck, and others in this propor- 
 tion. If this compost is applied in the spring, the 
 trees may also have a top dressing of hone diisf, if 
 easily obtained, in the autumn, at the rate of half a 
 peck to a tree. 

"The same compost, and the same quantities, will 
 ■answer admirably for the grape vine. But as the 
 -grape is a strong feeder, and likes more lime than 
 the pear, we would give it besides, an autumnal coat 
 -of lime, at the rate of from 50 to 100 bushels to the 
 acre, applied along with any manure or compost 
 most easily obtained. 

"For the plum tree, in light soils, (there is little 
 or no difficulty in growing it in elav soils,) we would 
 recommend a compost, made as follows: To two 
 wagon loads of strong li.am, or yellow clay, add a 
 bushel of cheap salt and four bushels of lime. Mix 
 the whole thoroughly; suffering it to lie at least a 
 ■fortnight. Apply this as a /op layer or top dresning 
 to the soil directly under the plum trees, (spreading 
 it over the surface as far as the branches ext(-nd,) at 
 the rate of two bushels to a middle sized bearing 
 tree, or half a peck to a young, newly planted 
 tree. 

"As a general compost for fruit trees, we repeat, 
 that nothing is equal to that formed of ashes and 
 peat. These materials are easily obtained in all 
 parts of the country, and they contain the elements 
 ■most essential in the organic and inorganic structure 
 of fruit trees. Where peat is not at hand, use wood 
 ashes alone, at the rate of half a bushel of leached 
 ■ashes to each middle sized bearing fruit tree. But 
 •as ashes furnish only the mineral or inorganic ele- 
 ments af food, the usual supply of ordinary manure 
 must not be withheld, unless the soil is already suf- 
 ficiently rich."— Thomas' Fruit Culturist.

Practical Hints to Cultivation of Pears ou Q.uince. 

By W. E. Hooker, Rochester, N. Y. 
 The pear-loving the pear-cultivating public, h.avc 
 of late years had their attention frequently called to 
 the advantage of growing pear trees worked upon 
 quince s dck, both by the writers upon such thenies, 
 and by the nurserymen interested in supplying their 
 w.ants. Ihe advantages and objections to' the prac- 
 tice, have been fully discussed by many, and now 
 nearly every one who reads horticultural books, or 
 attends horticultural meetings, know something about 
 them from experience or observation. .Still there 
 are many who plant their frees, and are disappointed 
 m their , wn case, and perhaps are disposed to blame 
 those who have led them into the experiment 

My present purpose is not to give any new views 
 of cultivation aud management, but simply a-^ain to 
 call attention to a few important features which 
 have been b:>fore ably set forth but which are often 
 overlooked by cultivators, who proceed upon thesup- 
 posiUon that the same treatment which enabled them 
 to gather pears from trees upon pear stocks, will an- 
 swer equally well with those upon quince I desire 
 to remove this mistaken idea, and at the same time 
 encourage the cultivation of this most desirable 
 fruit, m the most satisfactory and economical method 
 If we examine the roots of a quince, we find that 
 they are numerous, but not large or long ■ they do 
 not extend to any great depth in the soil; nor are 
 they inclined to spreail a long distance from the stem 
 or collar of the tree; consequently, the supply of 
 food and moisture must be obtained within a small 
 space of ground, and the ability of the plant to sustain 
 leaves and branches, is of course proportioned to the 
 resources of its roots. If now, we graft a 2Ka.r tree 
 upon It, whose range of limbs, and of course of 
 leaves and fruit, is large, and which is provided by 
 nature with corre^^ponding roots, extendinn- deep 
 into the earth, securing firmness to the trunk and 
 moisture to the leaves, without by some artificial 
 means, providing for this disproportion of parts wo 
 must inevitably fail of full success. 

In proof of this, we find that those who have 
 planted dwarf pears in grass grounds, without giv- 
 ing them further care, and those who grow them in 
 rich, well cultivated soil but neglect to diminish the 
 tops sufiicicntly to enable the quince roots to sustain 
 the tree firmly, as well as those who have allowed 
 their healthy and beautiful pyramids to support an 
 enormous load of fruit while yet in infancy, thereby 
 so exhausting its energy that two or three years 
 nursing become necessary, before it ia again useful, 
 are not usually very strong advocates for pyramid' 
 or dwarf trees; their own experience, certainly^ 
 would not warrant them in recommending their 
 adoption, and if this were the best that could be 
 expected of them, all men would agree, that the less 
 we see of them the better we shall be off. 

The obvious methods of avoiding the evils n-hich 
 I_ have pointed out, are, to secure to the plant a suffi- 
 cient supply of food, by manuring more highly and 
 frequently than we find necessary for the pear stock, 
 by planting in such soils as do not sufi'cr severely 
 from drouth, by frequent stirring of the soil with 
 spade or hoe, and most especiallv by abundant 
 mulching; added to this it is indispensible, to re- 
 duce the size of the top, by pruning in the winter 
 or spring, and also in some cases during the summer, 
 though I apprehend we shall not in many instances, 
 do so, with that care and patience which M. Cappe, 
 and other eminent foreigners have seen fit to bestow 
 on their pets.
