One thins is certain, the man who is not willing 
 to pay some reg.aril to the peculiarities of the posi- 
 tion in which the pear is placed when worked upon 
 quince, need nut expect to gather as abundantly and 
 continually, !is some men do, who have never given 
 a thought" to their noble Bavtletts and Doyennes be- 
 yond stripping from their laden boughs, the luscious 
 fruits, with whicli nature lias crowned the year. But 
 to the good cultivator who can afford to spare an 
 hour, now and then, to care for the wants of his si- 
 lent laborers, there is an abundant and suvo reward 
 laid up, in the vigor, beauty and productiveness of 
 this class of trees. — [Ilor/iculturtst.

The Fruit Committee respectfully Report, That 
 since the September meeting of the Society; the fol- 
 lowing Fruits have been submitted to their examina- 
 tion; 

From Alexander Parker, of Moyamensing; — A 
 SeedtiiKj Peach, nearly three inches in diameter; 
 roundish: dull yellow, with a reddish cheek, and so 
 dark about the base as to appear almost black; tiesh 
 yellow, very juicy; flavor delicious; quality "very 
 good." 

From A. M. Faslwick:- — Tlie Pctrc Pear, from the 
 oriijinal tree — specimens very fine, two and throe- 
 (juarters inches long, by two and one-half broad;slein 
 varialdc, in one specimen five-eights of an iucli by 
 one-sixth, in another one and one-quai-ter by one- 
 eighth; flavor luscious; quality "host." 

From Isaac ]i. Baxter: — TIteJaaa Peach (Baxter's 
 Seedling, No. 1;) large, ton and ono-half inches in 
 circumference; roundish oblate; greenish yellowisli 
 white, with a red check; free; flavor delicious; qality 
 "very good" to "best." . . 

From Mr. Lathi, 242 Filbert st.: — La^^isia, a Seed- 
 ling Pear of small size; obovate pyriforni; greenish 
 yellow, a good deal russeted, with a mottled red cheek; 
 flesh rather dry; flavor saccharine and pleasant; quali- 
 ty scarcely "good." 

From Peter Williamson, 290 South Second St.: — 
 Specimens of a Seedlinij EiKjlish Walnut, of extraor- 
 dinary size and excellence; two ai\d one-sixteenth 
 inches long, one and tivo-eigh;hs wide, one and one- 

half thick; shell remarkable for its thinness, kernel 
 delicious; quality "best." The tree sprung from an 
 imported nut planted in 184G, and is now fifteen and 
 one-half inches in circumference at tlie surface of the 
 earth. It bore in 1852 for the first time. The at- 
 tention of Nurserymen is directed to this variety, 
 which could probalily be dwarl'cd and brought int(^ 
 speedy bearing by l)eing worked on theJuglanspraa- 
 parturiens. 

From Mrs. Geo. Ligr/cit, 140 Christian st. — The 
 Rei/nier Pear — size lull medium, two and one-half to 
 three inches long by two and one half to i and three 
 quarters bro;id;some specimens weighed eightounces; 
 obovate; yellow, with a numberof minute russet dots, 
 and very often a brilliant carmine cheek; stem cin- 
 namon color, three-quarters to seven-eights of an inch 
 long, by one-sixth thick, inserted in a rather deep, 
 narrow cavity; calyx open, with slun-t erect segments, 
 set in a wide, shallow basin; seed dark, plump, acute, 
 with an angle on one side of the blunt end; flesh fine 
 texture, buttery,melting; flavor exceedingly luscious; 
 quality "best." Under the name of White Doyenno 
 or Butler Pear, which it is to all intents and pur- 
 poses, this variety has repeatedly received a premi- 
 um at our Annual Exhibitions. And not until re- 
 cently were we informed by Mrs. Liggett that it ori- 
 ginated from ceed of the Butter Pear planted about 
 twenty-five years ago by her grandmother, Madame 
 Regnier. On examining the tree, which is now two 
 feet seven inches in circumference at the surface of 
 the earth, there is no appearance of its having been 
 worked. Many suckers have sprung up from the 
 root, presenting a similarity in wood and foliage to 
 the tree itself, The growth is more erect and the 
 top more full and rounded than is usual with the 
 White Doyenne. We would suggest a trial of this 
 variety in localities where the White Doyenne has 
 long since ceased to flourish. 

From Henry W. Terry, Hartford, Connecticut: — 
 Tlie Clark Pear, a supposedSeedling. Size medium; 
 two and one-half inches by two and seven-eighths, 
 roundish, inclining to turbinate, broad at the crown, 
 rounded at the base; skin smooth, greenish yellow, 
 with numerous small russet dots, and sometimes a 
 warm salmon cheek; stem one inch by one-seventh^ 
 inserted in a very superficial depression; calyx small, 
 closed, set in a wide, rather deep, furrowed basin; 
 seed brown, flat, inclining to oval, with a slight an- 
 gle at the blunt end; flesh fine, texture, buttery, melt- 
 ing; flavor excellent, with a delicate aroma; quality 
 at least "very good;" perhaiiH we should not err iu; 
 saying "best." The Clark Pear bears a good deal of 
 resemblance in form, texture, flavor and seed, to the 
 Autumn Bergamot of Col. Carr, described in the 
 Transactions of the National Congress of Fruit Grow- 
 ers, for 1849, page 72. 

From Peter Raahc: — Four varieties of his Seedling, 
 Grapes. In 1845, Mr. Raabe obtained a collection, 
 of Grape Seed fr m Germany, which he planted in a; 
 bed in his garden. Many of these seed vegetatedi 
 and as the young plants .were exposed, without the 
 slightest jirot.Mtion, to the inclemenc3-jof the weather, 
 none but the hardiest survived. Of tliese the follow- 
 ing fimr have already fruited, and are unquestion- 
 ably varieties of great merit: 

The Brinckle — ( Raalie's No. 1 ) — Buncli' large, ra- 
 ther compact, sometimes shouldered; berry five- 
 eighths of an inch in diiimi'tor; round; black; flesh-- 
 solid, not pulpy; flavor rich, vinous, and saccharine} 
 quality "best." Fruited lii 1850 for the first time. 

'she Emily — [llanhc's No. 1) — Bunch largo, not 
 very compact, pocasionally shouldered; berry below
