downs where he CDulJ fatten one Merino." On the 
 other hunJ, "5Ir. Trimmer, who had a consitlerablo 
 flock of them, soys that in disposition to fatten they 
 equal the Southd<)wns, and the mutton is of the first 
 quality." — Evidence before the House of Lords in 
 1828. "The public has decided between these gen- 
 tlemen. The 5Ierinoes did not afford aremunerating 
 price in the carcase and they wove abandoned." 
 Now my own experience with Merinocs has been 
 just this much : a few years ago I had quite a lot 
 sent me from New York State, and being unable to 
 dispose of as many of them as I wished, I Avas 
 obliged to winter a part of them; about 60 I put to 
 Southdown rams, and about as many I did not per- 
 mit to breed; early the next season I sold the whole 
 lot together to two dairymen. They first drew all the 
 lambsnnd were much pleased wiih them,tellingmeth.at 
 they all died ■xh ite and nice except one or two; but 
 when they began to kill the old ones they backed 
 square out, telling me that they looked so yellow 
 and bad they worn afraid to expose them in market; 
 and finally they paid me several dollars sooner than 
 comply with their agreement to take them. 

The Leicester I found to be a fine breed where one 
 could keep a shepherd to look after them; but with 
 me (hey would frequently lie down, stretch them- 
 selves out and not be able to get hold of the ground 
 again, and in struggling would get more on their 
 backs and die, being helpless, tender and poor suck 
 lers. For the last twenty years I have bred South- 
 downs, for the reason that I have found them the 
 hardiest of any breed that I have ever bred, and 
 their wool sufBciently fine for any article of clothing 
 that I desire. They are particularly a hill sheep, 
 and I believe the best mutton sheep that has over 
 been introduced into this country; and I presume the 
 main reason why they are not more highly valuedis, 
 that the few little flocks scattered through our coun- 
 try have been so long bred in the same families that 
 they have decreased in size, and of course in quan- 
 tity of wool. 

A writer in the "Annals of Agriculture," states 
 that "he has frequently had black lambs, although he 
 never kept a black ram or ewe." From this he 
 draws the conclusion that their original color wa-- 
 black; that art alone produced the white woo', and 
 that if the best of the Southdowns were left in a 
 wild state, they would in a few years become black 
 again. JOSEPH COPE.

 Eaid and written to rectify abuses and suggest im- 
 provements in our autumnal esliiliitions. When 
 opinions differ materially, a comparison of their mo!- 

its, by calling the attention of the public thereto, 
 ca'^notbe inappropriate. 

What is the object of our great fhuit exhibitions? 
 IIow can lookers on bo most benefitted? Not cer- 
 tainly by misrepresentations. Is it not virtually act- 
 ing falselv or misrepresenting to place before our 
 gaze, pears, apricots, nectarines and plums, of tempt- 
 ing appearance, but worthless, because out of sear 
 son? If we look upon these "golden treasures" for 
 the fir.5t time, and fancy how much we would d sire 
 such luscious looking varieties as Dearborn's Seed- 
 ling, Julienne, Steven's Genesee, Washington, Ogden, 
 ifec, itc, at this season, and purchase trees, how we 
 shall be disappointed. But a greater loss to the com- 
 munity and mortification to the individual awaits 
 him who, for the first time, tastes these kept-outrof- 
 season varieties. 

They had been seen, admired, and their culture 
 commenced, but, for the first time, an opportunity is 
 had to taste. AVhat! These golden Washingtons, 
 Juliennes, Dearborns and Gone^ees worthless! — 
 Have trees been sold us to produce such trash? 
 They must be eradicated or re-ingrafted. The hoe, 
 knife or saw, is accordingly applied, and these esti- 
 mable varieties, in their season, with proper ripenhiff, 
 are replaced by others infinitely less valuable. Have 
 not these results happened by false representa- 
 tions ? 

AVhen varieties have been kept out of season and 
 their flavour gone, should not this fact be made 
 prominent by the exhibitor as well as the Chair- 
 mati's report? The Committee may have met the 
 particular variety for the first time, and from their 
 opinion thereof promulgate it through their report 
 to the great detriment of cultivators, unless this in- 
 formation is nut in their possession. 

Let the main object of these exhibitions be con- 
 stantly kept in view, — the diffusion of correct infor- 
 mation among all visitors. E.

"This is one of the most natural and honorable of 
 temporal pursuits, and yet, like all others, is liable 
 to perversion, where a covetous and overeaching 
 spirit is indulged. But where there is found an hon- 
 est and patient endeavour to secure a livelihood by 
 the sweat of the brow, this is peculiarly blest to the 
 laborer, adding to an adequate support, tlie blessing 
 of health and peace. "The labor of the righteous 
 tendeth to lile" and "better is a little with righteous- 
 ness, than great revenue without right," "for riches 
 arc not forever," "He tliat is greedy L.f gain troubleth 
 his own house."
