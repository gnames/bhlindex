the mind iind rQfine the lealing^; and, says an ad- 
 mirer of them, good it is to regard in the works of 
 God, the power and wisdom of God, and to gaze with 
 delight on the transcendant beauty that deoorat:s 
 earth and lieav^n; but he who wouUl drink deeply of 
 that spirit of thankful delight, which the true lover 
 of nature enjoys, must be keenly susceptible to the 
 goodness and love so univei'sally mingled with the 
 visible creation. 

Nature is to bo fdtas wo'il as to l.o seen by man; 
 that it shall harmonize with his aQectlons, andbcac- 
 oonimudatsd to the moods of his mind. When he 
 walk< aliroad at war with himself, fevered with 
 wrong, wounded. by calumny, or stung with self re- 
 proach, the waving trees and murmui'Ing rills are 
 peace makers; the very hues of creati )n are oil and 
 balr,'i to him; there is mercy in the cool greens of 
 earth and the mild blue of heaven, for they calm his 
 troubled spirit, and soothe him to repose." With 
 such an appreciation of natures beauties, how delight- 
 ful must be a ijountry life; but if the mind is suflered 
 to be borne down by a grovelling spirit, or with dis- 
 content, its charms must bo lost. A sordid loce of 
 gain will rob the mind of tliat true enjoyment which 
 nature to her votary yields, and leaness of spirit will 
 be the inevitable and final result. "He that tilleth."

Dear Sir: — It 
 affords me great pleasure to enclose with ibis com- 
 munication a copy of one of our county papers giv. 
 ing you an account of the jirst Agricultural Fair 
 ever held in Bradford county. The most sanguine 
 friends of tlie Society were very agreeably surprised 
 at the success which attended it. Considerable at- 
 tention has been paid, as you are perhaps aware, for 
 several years past to the iniprov emcnt by some of the 
 older and enterprising farmers of this countj', of cat. 
 tie. Some of the imported stock of John Hare Pow- 
 ell was brought into this county by Judge Lapoite, 
 seveial years ago and his exam pie was rapidly fol- 
 lowed by other and enterprising farmers in all parts 
 of the county and at the recent fair it was the unan 
 imous opinion of these present who had visited the 
 State fairs at Ilarrisburg and Lancaster, that this 
 County equaled Lancaster, and excelled Ilarrisburg 
 in the exhibition of Cattle. The Short Horn Diir. 
 hams were the most numerous. The sample s of coin 
 crop and wheat exhibited were very good and although 
 none of the crops of corn eqijalled the great one grown 
 last year in our neighboring crunty, j'et thejerops pie 
 pcnted were very large and in wheat I think it very 
 doulitlul if any county in the State can produce its 
 efjuul. The field on which the crop referred to in the 
 paper was lai: e 1; lies about five miles from this phice 
 on the old turnpike, leading from Berwick to Wells- 

burg, it belongs to a farm bought some years since 
 from the "Fr.anklin College" which at that time own- 
 ed a very largo tract in Ihatncighborhood. The soil 
 like most of the soil in that county looks roiigh but 
 on close examination is found composed o^ decompos- 
 ed grey llinesionc which has mingled with ihe soil 
 and the deeper the plow is put the richer the soil 
 turned up. In walking over the field last week in 
 Company with several other'; we picked up several 
 flat stones which on breaking we found to be very 
 soft and also to contain the imprint of shells and 
 other fossil remains which appear to be pradnally 
 decomposing from year to year and mingling with 
 the soil produces the finest crops of wheat and corn 
 that can be raised. I was not aware until this visit 
 that the soil of our cou iily pofsessed so valuable an 
 ingredient, but so it is. I had picvieu.'-ly rrticcd in 
 digging cellars, that flat stones ih.rown out from a 
 depth of 3 and 4 feet would break and exhibit tl.e 
 the same appearance of she Us ar.d tiacks of biids 
 but as the fine forests give place to cultivated farms 
 these stones are turned np and crushed on the sur- 
 face and so furnish a most valuable manure. The dis- 
 play of garden vegetables was much better than any 
 one had possibly conceived and so < f agricultural im- 
 plements and the products of the dairy — the latter 
 was not quite as exiensivc as might have been but 
 it will be quite large next year. ThcCourt House was 
 appropriated for the display of flowers and fancy 
 work for full particulars of which I refer you to the 
 accompanying paper. 

We feel confident in saying to our sister counties in 
 Southern Pennsylvania, that the "northern tier" hith- 
 erto considered isolated and frenucntly styled "north- 
 ern Barbarians" by our brethern along the Southern 
 part is destined to lead them a hard laee in compet- 
 ing for the superiority of their farms and farm crops 
 but it is a race in which the rivals can afford like 
 Nelson and Colliugwood"to havenolitl'e jciilousles." 

Yours truly,

Improved Mowing Machine. 
 Martin Hallenbeck, of the city of Albany. N. Y., 
 has taken measures to sccurca patent for an improve- 
 ment in mowing machines, which consists in placing 
 the sickle en- cutter at the back of the driving wheel, 
 and attaching Ihe draft pole to Ihe machine out of 
 line wiih the driving wheel, and at the side cjf the 
 dii\ing wheel ti.wards the sickle. By this nrrange- 
 incnt, the line of draught is in;idc to couiiieiaet Ihe 
 resistance which the grass offers to the sickle; Ihe 
 sickle consequently moves fcjrward in a steady man- 
 ner, keeping in the same line; the machine thereby 
 being made to pnicecd with a very steady motion. 
 The fingers of this machine for holding the grass, 
 are peculiarly constructed, so as to prevent llic grnsn 
 being forced out from them when acted upmi by the 
 sickle ; the recesses in the fingers arc also prevented 
 from being clogged or filled ^^ith dirt. The sickle is 
 also sojui-id above the fingers by a metal plate, in a 
 very superior nuiuner. — lb.
