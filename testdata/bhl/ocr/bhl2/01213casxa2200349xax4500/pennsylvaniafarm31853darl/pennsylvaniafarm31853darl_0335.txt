Tlie followino: remarks from the Mark Lano (Lnn- 
 doii) Express, show that we may rely on a continued 
 heavy demand fur our breadstuff's all through the 
 season : 

The weather has for some days past been of the 
 most unfavorable cliaraoter ; heavy rain has fallen 
 in all parts of the kingdom, and a complete stop has 
 been put to the harvest operatious. Undi?r these 
 circumstances, it is not siirprisinj; that the depres" 
 sion which was caused by thtV large arrival of for- 
 eign wheat last week, should have proved hut tran- 
 sitory, nioro especially as the demand for wheat (or 
 shipment to France — which was checked bythe stojis 
 taken by the government of that country, about a 
 fortnight ago, in regard to the prices of bread in Pa- 
 ris — has again revived. 

We are not in the habit of taking extreme views, 
 indeed we have been frequently .accused of an excess 
 of caution ; but in the present instance our readers 
 will ac'.cnowlodge that we have for months past 
 pointed out the probability of a high range of prices 
 for wheat. This we wore induced to do solely on ac- 
 count of the knowledge of the smallness of the 
 breadth under culture, and the generaiiy inauspi- 
 cious natnre of the seasons. What has since occur- 
 red could not be foreseon. That a large porlion of 
 the crop should be injured by rain, and remain in 
 the fitdds in the middle of .S.^pt.'mlier, has greatly 
 added to our difficulties ; and it is now almost impos- 
 sible to fix a limit to the upward movement in prices. 
 If Great Britain had alone been visited by a bad har- 
 vest, the effect im prices would probably not have 
 been important; liut unlortunalcly ; the seasons have 
 been much the same over the greater part of Eu- 
 rope. 

The countries vvliich in ordinary years would have 
 been enabled to have afforded m supplies, are them- 
 selves in want of assistance; and .so apprehensive 
 have many of the fort'ign governments become ot 
 dearth, that the laws regulating th:5 impm-tation and 
 exportation have been altered; restrictions on import? 
 h ive been relaxed or wholly withdrawn, and exports' 
 &c., all require supplies. In the countries Ijordercd 
 by the Baltic, stocks of old wlieat are either exhaust- 
 ed or reduced into a very narrow compass, and sup- 
 plies of the new crop cannot be availabli; in quantity 
 before the spring of next year. The rye harvest has 
 turned out badly all over the north of Europe, and 
 the potato disease is very prevalent; the consumption 
 of wheat will therefore be greater than usual, and 
 there will Ije less to spare for export. 

It appears, therefore, tliat we shall have to depend 
 mainly for our supply of Brc.adstuffs on the United 
 States and Canada. Previous experience has proved 
 that America cannot, as a general rule, export large- 
 ly, unless prices in Europe are sufficiently high to 
 cover the expenses of conveying the grain from a 
 great distance in the interior to the seab(n-d. Fine 
 •weather for securing the remainder of the outstand- 
 ing crops, and an amicable arrangement of the east- 
 ern question, might give a somewhat better complex- 
 ion to affairs; butlooking at matters as they now stand 
 fiere is reason to apprehend that a large portion of 
 the population will, during the ensuing winter, have 
 to suffer from a scarcity and consequent high prices 
 of food-

FLOUR is rather more inquired for, and sales for 
 export, including good straight brands at Sfi,50; .300

GRAIN— The receipts and sales of AVhcat are 
 moderate, and the market is nearly stationary; about 
 5000 bushels, mostly prime Southern reds, scjld at 
 lo5c, and 7000 bushels white at 1-Uc for good South- 
 ern and 142al45c for prime Pennsylvania, the lattea 
 afloat. Rye is scarce and wanted at 88 cts' 

CORN — the want of vessels limits the demand 
 good Southern and Pennsylvania yellow is offered at 
 78a80 cents, but the market closes witli a little more 
 firmness on the part of holders. Oats are about sta- 
 tionary, with further sales of 2000 to oOOO bushels 
 Southern at •t5a46 ccn s.

Rule ron Fiyni^c tue Weight of Live vStock by 
 Me.\surem' NT. — The girth is the circumfcrance of 
 the animal just behind the shoulder blades. Tho 
 length is the distance from the shoulder blade to tho 
 rear of tho buttock. The superficial feot are obtain- 
 ed bv multiplying the girth and the length. The fid- 
 fowing talilo cimtains tho rule toasccrtain the weight 
 of the animal ; —

 then be 34 square ft. This multiplied by 23, in ac-
