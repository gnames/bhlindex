FOWL MEADOW GRASS, *c. 

[NOVEMEEB 

Fowl Meadow Grass. 

We have received from c ur old friend A. Jones, 
 Esq., of Friinkfort, the following; communications re- 
 specting fowl meadow grass. As we stated in a 
 former number, there is a variety or species of the 
 a(;rostis genius of grasses, tliat is native in the low 
 nioi^t lands, throughout(,the whole length and hre.adth 
 of Maine, and is known by tlie name of fowl mead- 
 ow grass. 

There is also another variety of fowl meadow, cul- 
 tivated from seed brought from JIassachusetts, and 
 the middle States, which is like it, but not quite so 
 coarse. They are both esoellcnt grasses, and well 
 worth cultivating.— Ed 

Mr. Editor: — This grass deserves increased at- 
 tention. As one motive for its propagation, the pub- 
 lic may be assured it is a native grass of Maine. It 
 was found on the Madawaska meadows, when the 
 French tirst settled there. On clearing off wooded 
 land on those meadows, or on the lands adjacent, 
 fowl meadow grass comes in without sowing seed. — 
 This comes of the seed dropped in the manure, from 
 Mo ise and Deer that feed on those meadows, and of 
 cattle since the settlement. This grass prevails on 
 all the meadows on the river St. Jolins, subject to 
 overflow; also on the Mirimachi. It can be maile to 
 grow on anylcind oi land not too wet, best on moist 
 laud, fli.urishing especially well on land adjacent to 
 streams overflown in times of freshets. 

It is not a water grass, hence will not bear being 
 overdowed by a dam all winter. An opinion prevails 
 that to preserve tliis grass in perl'ection, it must be 
 permitted to stand, until some of the seed will .scat- 
 ter in the process of curing. It would seem that this 
 need not be every year, for like many utiier plants, it 
 propagates by offshoots from the roots at the top of 
 the ground. No grass suffers less by standing past 
 the best time to cut. Does not rust, nor does herds 
 grass rust mixed with it. If the burthen be ever so 
 heavy, this grass is never coarse. Near the ground 
 it is wiry and full of joints, containing but little mois- 
 ture, hence is easily made dry, is so h)ng and limber 
 as to be easily secured from the effect of rain.

Mr. A. Jones, — Sis; — Yours of July 28th is re- 
 Ceivi'd, making inquiry of the grass or native grass 
 of this part of the c lunty. I have made some-inqui- 
 ry, and also am ai-quainted with the grass of which 
 you wish in, fi rmation on. This grass is a native of 
 this county, and so far as I am informed it is fowl 
 meadow; please find enclosed a specimen of the grass. 
 You can be assured that this grass is native of this 
 part of the country, and also you will find it in all 
 the meadows on River St. John. I have cut some of 
 the same kind of grass on my lot this season: 

Respectfully yours, S. Steven

?ow Destroying her Pigs, 

The best way with a .sow that destroys her pigs is 
 to take them from her till you have them all: then 
 have two or more persons take hold gently but firm- 
 ly, lay her flat, tie her legs and hold her fast; put a 
 string round her nose, if you please, to stop her noise, 
 then bring the pigs; put them to her. let them suck. 
 She will very likely soon begin a pleasant noise and 
 take them kindly; if the first time does not answer 
 try it the second. I have tried this method several 
 times and never knew it fail of complete success.

PUBLISHER'S NOTICE TO SUBSCRIBERS. 

While we have the pleasure of returning thanks 
 to a large number of our subscribers, for their promp 
 remittances for the present volume, we regret to have 
 to state that there are many who are in arrears for 
 the same, and a few who have not paid up for the 
 previous volumes. The amount thus due from each 
 individual is so small, and their residences are so 
 scattered over the State, that it will not pay to era- 
 ploy a collector. 

Though we prize our friends much, we should 
 praise them but little, and to their faces not at all.
