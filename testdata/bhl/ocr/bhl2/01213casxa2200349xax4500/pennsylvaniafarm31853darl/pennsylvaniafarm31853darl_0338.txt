COUNTY FAIRS. 

[December 

counties, on the New York lino, east of Potter, about 
 whicli we had some interesting; statistics in our April 
 number of present volume. Iler second e.Khibition 
 was held on the 5th and Gth of October. The weather 
 was unfavorable, but notwithstanding the rain and 
 mud, pome fine stock was brought to the ground (rom 
 a considerable distance, among which about 13 head 
 offine Devons, from Col. Little of Bradford township, 
 were conspicuous. There were also fine specimens 
 of native breeds, as well as some Durhams and South- 
 down sheep: — also fruit, vegetables and fancy work. 
 The whole wound up with an excellent address, 
 from Hon. B. D. Ilanilin, from which we intend to 
 copy some extracts. We do not know his occupation, 
 but if he will practice, what he preaches, we will 
 guarantee that he makes a good farmer. McKean 
 county is said to be remarkably adapted for grazing, 
 and the Agricultural Society will give quite an im- 
 pulse to the improvement of stock, which would do 
 credit to her fine pastures. 

Mifflin county. — This was either her third or 
 fourth exhibition and the premium list appears to 
 have embraced a wide range, of stock and other ar- 
 ticles for competition, such as agricultural imple- 
 ments, premiums for the best managed farms, grain, 
 vegetables, domestic and household manufoctures. 
 Bread, Butter, Preserves, Honey, Fruit, &c. The list 
 of premiums indicates that considerable attention has 
 been paid to the improvement of the breeds of cattle, 
 «heep, swine, and poultry. The society is in such a 
 prosperous condition, that the managers propose to 
 purchase a lot, and erect perraar.cnt fixtures for its 
 accommodation. 

Westmoreland couxty. — The Fair for this county 
 was held at Mount Pleasant on the I8th of Octo- 
 'ber, and is described as a very fine affair. West- 
 moreland, is one of our richest agricultural West- 
 ern counties, famous for her superior wheat and 
 also cultivates largely rye, oats, Indian corn and 
 buckwheat. Considerable attention is also paid 
 to raising cattle, sheep and swine. We had expec- 
 ted a good report from her, and this the third annual 
 exhibition shows she is fully up with the times. The 
 amount of stock exhibited was very large, and that 
 of horses especially fine. The premiums awarded 
 was quite liberal and the attendance unusually great. 
 We should be pleased to publish a list of the officers 
 «f this society. 

Schuylkill county. — The second annual exhibi- 
 tion was held in North Manheira township and occu- 
 pied three days. "It is spoken of as not large but 
 «mbracing a variety of horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, 
 Poultry, Grain, flour, potatoes, and vegetables, gen- 
 erally, agricultural implements, carriages, harness, 
 dairy and household manufactures, productions of 
 the loom, &c., presenting most gratifying evidence of 
 the skill and industry of the farmers and mechanics, 
 as well as the productive character of the agricultur- 

al portion of the county." The ladies department 
 appears to have been well represented, and contained 
 some fine specimens of needle work, also, woolen 
 stockings, mittens, &c. A leading feature of the ex- 
 hibition, as in mo.it other places this season, was the 
 Poultry, which was very fine, and from a large num- 
 ber of contributors. Our friend, and occasional cor- 
 respondent of the Journal, J. S. Keller is Secretary 
 and Libra! ian of this society. AVe should like to hear 
 from him more frequently. He and J. J. Paxson, 
 seem to have been successful competitors, in horses, 
 cattle, sheep, swine and fii'ld crops. — Their influence 
 and example will have a happy effect, through tho 
 whole county in stimulating future competition. 

Northumberland county. — The recent exhibition 
 of this society appears, to have been one of the very 
 best, yet hold in the State. With the exception of 
 neat cattle, which were not on the ground in such 
 numbers or of such improved breeds, as in some other 
 counties, tho different departments appear to bave 
 been well filled, and embraced some fine blooded 
 horses, superior swine, of great size and fatness, and 
 a magnificent display of Poultry. This latter was 
 to have boon expected, as our friend David Taggart 
 who resides at Northumberland, was one of the first 
 in the State to give attention to improving our breeds 
 of poultry, and whose good example, has no doubt 
 contributed to extend the poultry fever through that 
 section. lie is well posted up, with the origin, pecu- 
 liaritiis, and respective value of the different breeds, 
 now most esteemed, and has probably one of the 
 best collections in tho State. 

There appears to have been also, a fine display of 
 articles of domestic manufacture in that county, such 
 as furniture, needle and fancy work, drawings and 
 paintings from tho Milton Female Seminary, daguer- 
 reotypes, broad cloths, flannels, coverlet^', woolen 
 yarn, wine, preserves, cranberries, &c. 

The whole was concluded with a capital address 
 from David Taggart, which was received with great 
 satisfaction, and which we hope to be furnished with, 
 to make same extracts for the Farm Journal. 

Mercer county. — We understand an exhibition 
 was held in this county, at which an address was 
 delivered by that sterling friend of agricultural im- 
 provement in Pa., James Gowen, Esq., but we have 
 not been able to obtain any information about it, 
 directly 9r indirectly. Will some one please acquaint us 
 with what was done there. We do not recidlect that 
 we ever had a list of the officers, of the Mercer 
 County Society. Mercer is one of our Western coun- 
 ties, bordering on Ohio, well watered by fine streams, 
 and very productive in wheat, as well m corn, oats, 
 potatoes and live stock. Large numbers of the latter 
 are raised for the eastern market. It is also well lo- 
 cated, in respect to our internal improvements. 

J, LAIR county. — This exhibition took place on the 
 20th, and 21st and 22d, October; occupying two days,
