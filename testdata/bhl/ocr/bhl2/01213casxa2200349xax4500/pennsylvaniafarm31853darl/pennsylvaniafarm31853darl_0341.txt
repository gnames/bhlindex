chanical, whilst tliat of saltpefi-e (nitrate of potash) 
 as entirely chemical. When a quantity of dry salt 
 is applied to pork recently killed, and thus lelt in a 
 dry apartment, the salt will i^oon assume a moist 
 appearance in conse(|uence of the union of the moi.s- 
 ture in the meat with the salt, eventually forming a 
 liquid calle<i brine. I( this hrine and moist salt is 
 now thrown away, and fresh dry salt applii^d, the 
 whole of the moisture in the meat may be extracted 
 with the exception of that moisture which is retain- 
 ed by the greater chemical affinity of the animal 
 fibre. Meat so treated would, no doubt, keep well, 
 but it would be excessively salt. In the course of 
 salting meat, the animal tissues become saturated 
 with a solution more or loss strong, according to cir- 
 cumstances, of salt. In drying, the water in the 
 brine is evaporated, the meat becomes to a certain 
 extent desiccated, many of the pores are filled with 
 and the exterior parts become covered with an efflor- 
 escence of salt; the moisture having been in a great 
 measure extracted, combined with the presonoe of a 
 considerable quantity of salt not only in the tissue 
 but as an exterior coating, preserves the meat from 
 the action of the atmosphere, provided it is kept in a 
 dry place. Salt alime will not give that agreeable 
 red colour so much ailmired in preserved meats; this 
 is accomplished by using a small quantity of salt- 
 petre. The change of colour caused by using salt- 
 petre is a pretty fair proof that a chemical combina- 
 tion takes place; a further proof is that the muscular j 
 fibres are rendered decidedly firmer when used, and ! 
 when in excess, causes the muscular part of the meat 
 to become liarshly hard, or, as it is commonly term- j 
 ed, etringy and tough. 

The difference between hogs that have been well ' 
 and ill fed consists mainly in the circumstance that 
 the well fed nogs have their cellular tissue firmly 
 knit together, enveloping firm and well filled cells of 
 fat; indiS'erently â™¦ed hogs have the muscular or lean 
 parte loose and flabby, the cellular tissue aud envel- 
 oped fat is also loose, and sinks easily on pressure 
 by the finger. The tissues, instead of being firm 
 and elastic and of a white colour, will be found soft, 
 non-elastic, and of an opalescent colour, smiilar to 
 that of ordinarily formed calves' feet jelly prior to 
 being clarified for table. The fat participates in this 
 colour in consequence of the tissues being soft and 
 large, though containing mure moisture than those 
 of well fed bogs, which also accounts for the deficien- 
 cy of elasticity; the cells are imperfectly filled with 
 fat. From the preceding details it will be apparent 
 that a much greater quantity of moisture or briiic 
 may be anticipated in salting an ill fed over that 
 which will i;sue from a well fed hog, and in practice 
 such is found to be the case; the moisture withdrawn 
 is replaced on drying by crystals of salt filling up 
 the vacant interstices, which, as these will alwa\'B be 
 much more numerous in loan than fat hogs, will 
 cause the bacon on drying to be disagreeably salt. 
 The far famed Westphalian bams have to be steeped 
 prior to cooking, in consequence of this property; 
 well fed Westphalian haras (a rara avis) do not re- 
 quire steeping prior to cooking, it is evident from 
 the property here described tliat any mode of proce- 
 dure which will prevent an undue flow of the sapid 
 fluids which exist in the pork, is desiralile if unat- 
 tended with more than commensurate disadvantages. 
 This can be dime by applying in the first instance a 
 sprinkling of saltpetre. Sliouid the atmosphere, 1 
 however, be very free from humidity, it may bo ne- 
 cessary to use a little common salt, wliich, "from its 
 cure deliquescent property, has a tendency to bo-' 

come liquid (brine) by the absorption of water frOTi 
 the air, and the fluids in the meat thus accelerate the 
 operation of the saltpetre. This being done, it is to 
 be rubbed, &c., with salt in the usual manner. The 
 acticm of the saltpetre when applied as described is 
 to combine with the water of the fibres and tissues 
 of the meat, thus causing them to contract, render- 
 ing the meat less vesicular or porous, and conse- 
 quently will not retain so much salt from the brino 
 on drying. The disadvantages are that the fibres of 
 the meat are rendered somewhat hard. In a general 
 way, and under ordinary circumstances of heat and 
 humidity of the atmosphere, it is best to apply a 
 mixture of salt and saltpetre at first. When well 
 fed hogs are to bo cured, if the atmosphere is very 
 dry, salt alone shouM be applied at first, then salt- 
 petre alone sprinkled over the meat, the brine being 
 afterwards well rubbed in and thrown over the meat; 
 salt quantum siiff. to be applied subsequently. In 
 very moist or bad curing weather, saltpetre should 
 be applied alone at fir~t, unless there is a fear that 
 the meat will decay, in which case salt must be ap- 
 plied. From this cause it is almost impossible to 
 cure pork in hot weather other than by using salt 
 and saltpetre in combination. These are general 
 rules, the result of experience, which however may 
 be greatly modified by circumstances. Notwith- 
 standing which, they ar3 valuable as rules, and, if 
 carefully attended to, will be found (jn trial worthy 
 of notice. A great deal is stated by writers on the 
 necessity of well rubbing in the salt, &o.; as this 
 cannot bo performed by the bare hand on the largo 
 scale, some curersfurnish their workman with brush- 
 es furnished with a str.ip nailed across the top for 
 the hand to go through; with these the outer skin of 
 the bacon is well rubbed. I am not inclined to put 
 a very high value on the act of rubbing jkv se; iu 
 d(jing so, however, the operator necessarily more 
 fairly distributes the salt, &c., and the whole of the 
 skin gets softened, for nothing causes pork "tu take 
 the salt so ilcIL" as the whole of the skin being made 
 soft, and in the ordinary mode of placing side upon 
 side there always exist patches that remain hard.: 
 rubbing, continual shifting, and turning the sides 
 almost entirely remedy this defect. Forcuringpork, 
 a dry room with a trough formed of slate passing 
 along each side and end of the room, and not more 
 than 12 inches deep, is the best; it may, however, be 
 made of stone, wood, or wood lined with lead. Slate 
 and wood lined with lead will be found the best, the 
 fornier to be prolerred. Wood alone is the worst 
 material that can be used. 

The sides being all prepared as previously de- 
 scribed, salt and saltpetre, alone or mixed, are to be 
 sprinkled over each, and then laid on each other un- 
 til eight, ten, or a dozen sides are heaped together, 
 the number varying according to tlie thickness of 
 the sides: half a dozen will, however, be founil the 
 most convenient number. In the course of twenty- 
 four hours m- a couple of days, according as thi- salt 
 is converted into brmc, the sides are removed, rubbed 
 and replaced in an inverse order, the topmost being 
 this time plac'd at the bottom. A little fresh salt is 
 sprinkled between each course, and the brine thrown 
 over the whole. In very damp weather, the brining 
 should be omitted; if so, the sides should be well 
 washed and rul)bed in the brine previously to re- 
 packing. In favourable weather for curing, once 
 turning :iiid replacing will be fiuiid sufficient, and 
 will not occupy m n"e than a week. In packing, the 
 skin, or rind side, is invariably placed nndi'rneath.
