peated. Wlien complitjd, the sides are taken duvvii, 
 wiped dry, and laid on ruugli eauvas cluth, the lirst 
 side with the skin underneatli. Bay salt is now eo- 
 pidusly strewn over it; tlie next side is laid witii the 
 vihs lowermost, and the skin uppermost; another 
 side is then laid on this, with the skin lowermost; 
 another sprinkling of salt, on which is laid a side 
 with the rilis lowermost; the canvas wrapper is now 
 drawn over all, and corded. This is tlie mode the 
 jjreen haeon is sent to the metropolitan market li-om 
 Irelarul, it being found that, if smoKLd and perleetly 
 dried in Ireland, it does ncjt preserve so well as when 
 forwarded '•i/reeii," and then stored in the vaults of 
 the various London wharfs; from which it is drawn 
 in order to bo smoked as may be required for con- 
 sumption. The west of England bacon is sent to 
 London,_ ready dried, by laud carriage: it is only by 
 sea-carriage that bacon is obnoxious to damage when 
 dried and smoked ready for consumption. In curinn- 
 hams, a trinigh being provided us described, they 
 should ba first rubbed with a mixture of salt and 
 saltpetre, then laid with the shank end lowest at an 
 finjile of 45 degrees, and so on with every row; at the 
 second or third day they should be well rubbed with 
 the brine and salt, set up as before with a little fresh 
 Bait and saltpetre; in two days more they should be 
 again rubhod, and packed flat and as close as possi- 
 ble, the thick part of one row against the shanks of 
 the nest row, by whicU means the w hole will be 
 pearly c jvered with their own pickle. In a week or 
 ten days they will be cured and ready for dryin.', 
 which should be done by taking tliem out of the 
 pickle, setting them upright with the shanks down- 
 wards, and a little dry salt thrown over the thick 
 end. After being thus left for a week longer, they 
 will be ready for hanging up in the drying house, 
 which is in facta slow stove. Bacon and bams are 
 smoked by being firet damped, and then thrown 
 amongst some dry bran, which adheres to the meat, 
 and prevents its being ilisfigured by tlie soot; they 
 arc then hung up in a flagged room, with a channel 
 running down llie centre, towards which the floor 
 inclines on each side. Chaffers filled with sawdun 
 are now lighted, the room is o'osed and left. AV'hen 
 the fires are extinguished, and the bacon is supposed 
 to have absorbed as much smoke as it can, the place 
 i.s again entered, the bacon and hams taken down 
 tlie bran, with its attached soot, is brushed off, the 
 bacon IS now ready for market, as seen at the retail- 
 ers. The fat which has dripped irom the bacon in 
 smoking IS collected from the receptacle at the end 
 of the gutter, the dirt and ashes swept out, when 
 the place IS again ready for another lot. The fine 
 favour ol We.lporihan hams is stated to be duo to 
 the circumstanre of the smoking rooms being made 
 so high that the smoke is cM when it arrives at the 
 liams. 1 his may be the case in part: I rather at- 
 tribute their flavour to arise from the fact of the ni..s 
 be:ng of a small thin breed, and not killed unni 
 they are at least two years old. To have a ham in 
 perfection the hog ought to bo three yea s old when 
 kiled: to !eed ^uch would not pay tile farmer In 
 sating pork for bacon li lb. of salt is sufficient to 
 salt I stone of 14 lbs. ol meat, or 10 stones (2 cwt ) 
 would require 24 lbs. of salt; and with great care 
 and attention f nz. of saltpetre is sufficient for a 
 stone of meat, or 1 ib. fur 20 stones of meat. It is 
 n. safe practice to use 1 oz. of saltpetre to a stone of 
 pork. 'J'hese quantities are adapted to private use; 
 large curers use more of both articles.

Inverslou of the Womb in Cows. 

In the convulsive efforts in order to accomplish 
 the expulsion of the foetus, the womb itself some- 
 times closely follows the calf, and hangs from the 
 bearing, as low as or lower than the hocks, in the 
 toim of a large red or violet-colored bag. This is 
 called "Me downfall of ike calf-ba,,." It should be 
 returned as soon as possible, i^t there is usuallv 
 great pressure on the neck of the womb, which im- 
 pedes the circulation of the blood, and the protruded 
 part quickly grows livid and black, and is covered 
 with ulcerated S'lotf, and becomes gatigrenous and 
 niortihed; and this is rapidly increased by the injury 
 which the womb sustains in the continual Kettin^ 
 up and lying down of the cow in these cases 

Ine womb must iirst be cleansed from all the dirt 
 which It may have gathered. If much swelling has 
 taken place, and the bag looks thickened and gorged 
 with blood. It should be lightly yet freely seiTrified, ■ 
 and ho bleeding encouraged by warm fermentations. 
 While this is done, it should be carefully ascertained 
 uhether there is any distension of the rumen and 
 1 theiei.s, either the common puncture for hoovo 
 should be made in the flank, or a dose of the solu- 
 tion ot the chh>ndo of lime administered. A dis- 
 tended rumen .vould form an almost insuperable ob- 
 stacle to the return of the uterus. Two persons 
 should now support the calf-bag by means of a 
 strong, yet soft cloth, while, if the placenta yet re- 
 mains attached to it. a third peisou gently separates 
 It at every point. It would bo useless to attempt to 
 return the womb until iho cleansing is taken away 
 lor the labor pains would return as violently as bo- 
 tore. 1 he operator will carefullv remove the little
