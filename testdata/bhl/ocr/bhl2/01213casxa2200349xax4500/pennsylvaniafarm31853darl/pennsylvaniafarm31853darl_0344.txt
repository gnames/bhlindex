MANAGEMENT OF BARNYARD MANURE.

From Norlou's Elements of Sckntific Farming. 
 The manure of viirious domestic animals is, in this 

the manure collected in it will be of the most valua- 
 ble and po\ycrful description. The tank ma3- be made 
 of stone, brick, or wood, as is most c:>nvenient, and 
 need cost but very little. 

While the liquid manure is actually in many cases 

country, most commonly employed as a fcrti'lzer. all '''"i^'st entirely lo?t, the solid part is often allowed to 

other manures beinn; used in comparatively small 
 quantities; and yet even these aie seldom preser- 
 ved and applied as carefully as they might, or ou<rht 
 to be. ° 

The principal varieties are those o( the ox, the cow, 
 the hog, the horse, and the sheep. Of these, that of 
 the horse is most valuable in its fresh state: it con- 
 tains much nitrojjen, but it is very liable to lose by 
 fermentation. That of the hog comes ne.'Ct. That o^ 
 the cow is placed at the bottom of the list. This is 
 ■because the enriching substances of her food go prin- 
 cipally to the formation of milk, the manure bein" 
 thereby rendired poorer. 

The manure of all these animals is far richer than 
 the food given them, because it contains much more 
 nitrogen. This is for the reason that a large part of 
 the carbon and oxygen of the food are consumed in 
 the lungs and blood generally for the purpose of keep- 
 ing up the heat of the body. They are given off from 
 the lungs, and also by perspiration and evapuration 
 through the pores of the skin, in the forms of carbon- 
 ic acid and water. 

From animals fed npon rich food, the manure is 
 much more powerful than when it is poor. In Eno-- 
 land, for instance, where they fatten cattle largely- 
 on oil cake, it is calculated that the increased value 
 of the manure repays all of the outlay. This is the 
 reason why human ordure is better than manure 
 from any of the animals mentioned a.bove, the food 
 of Iran toeing rich and various. 

All these kinds of manure should be carefully col 
 lected and i)reservcd, both as to their liquiil and sol- 
 id parts. The liquid part or urine is particularly 
 rich in the phosphates and in nitrogen. This partis 
 hy very many farmers permitted in a great degree 
 to run away or evaporate. Some farmyards are con- 
 trived so as to throiv the water olF entirely, others 
 ccmvey it through asmall ditch upon the nearest field. 
 The liquid manure which might have fertilized sev- 
 eral acres in the course of the season, is thus concen- 
 trated upon one small spot, and the consequence is 
 a vegetation so rank as to be of very little use. Spots 
 of this kir.d may be seen in the neighborhood of 
 wany farm-yards, where the grass grows up so heavy 
 that it falls liowa and rots at the bottom, and has to 
 be cut several weeks before haying time, producing 
 strong coarse hay that cattle will scarcely touch. 

The proper way to save this liquid is to have a tank 
 or hole, into which all the drainings of the yard may 
 be conducted. Uleft here long, this lic^iud begins to fer- 
 ment, and lose nitrogen in the form of ammonia, which 
 It will be renierabcred is a compounl of nitrogen .and 
 hydrogen. To remedy this, a little sulphuric acid, 
 or a few pounds of plaster, may be occasionally 
 thrown in. The sulphuric acid will unite with the 
 ammonia, and form sulphate of ammonia, which will 
 remain unclianged, not being liable to evaporate. 
 Others prefer to mix sufficient poat, ashes, sawdust, 
 or fine charcoal with the liquid in the tank, to soak 
 U all up; others still pump it out and pour it upon a 
 compost heap. One point is to be noticed in the 
 management of a tank. Only the water which nat- 
 urally drains from the stables and yards should be 
 liUowed to enter it, all that falls from the eaves of the 
 ■buildings should Ije discharged elswhere. Regula- 
 ted in this way, the tank wiU seldom overflow, and 

drain and bleach, until nearly every thing solulile is 
 washed away;or isexposed in heaps to ferment, with- 
 out any covering. In such a case ammonia is always 
 formed and given off: it may often be perceived by 
 the smell, particularly in hor.se manure. The fact; 
 m.^iy also be shown, by dipping a leather in muriatic 
 acid and waving it ov-r the heap. If ammonia in 
 any quantity is escaping, white fumes will be visi- 
 ble about the feather, caused by the formation of mu- 
 riate of ammonia. A teacher can exemplify this by 
 holding a feather, dipped in the same way, over an 
 ammonia bottle. This escape of so valuablea substance 
 may be in a great measure prevented by shovelling 
 earth over the surface of the heap, to a depth of 
 two or three inch->s. If this does not arrest it entire- 
 ly, sprinkle a few handfuls of plaster upon the tope 
 the sulphuric acid of the plaster will as before unite 
 with the ammonia, and form sulphate of ammonia. 
 Manures containing nitrogen in large quantity .are 
 so exceedingly valuable, because this gas is required 
 to form gluten, and bodies of that class, ui the plant; 
 this is particularly in the .seed, and sometimes also 
 in the truit. Plants can easily obtain an abundance 
 of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, from the air, the 
 soil, and manure.s. Not so with nitrogen. They can 
 not get it from the air; there is little of it in most 
 soils; and hence manures which contain much of it, 
 produce such a marked effect. Not that it is more ne- 
 ce.tsari/ than tlieother organic bodies, but more scarce; 
 at least in a form available for plants. The same rea- 
 soning applies to phosphoric acid. It is not more 
 necessary than the other inorganic ingredients; but 
 still is more valuable, because more uncommon in 
 the soil and in manures. 

In all places where manure is protected from the sun, 
 and from much washing by rain, its value is greatly 
 increased. 

a. Horse manure particularly should not be left 
 exposed at all: it begins to heat and to lose nitrogen 
 almost immediately, as may be ]>erceived by the 
 smell. It should be mixed with other manures, or 
 covered by some absorl>ent earth, as soon as possible. 
 Almost every one who enters a stable in the morn- 
 ing, where there are many horses, must perceive 
 the strong smell of ammonia that fills the place. I 
 ; have seen in some stables, Itttle pans containing 
 plaster of paris or sulphuric acid, for the pui-pose 
 f absorbing these fumes, and forming sulphate of 
 ammonia, b. The liquid which runs from barnyards 
 and from manui-e heaps, is shown by analysis v'l con- 
 sist of the most fertilizing substances; and it is cal- 
 culated that where this is all allowed to wash away, 
 as is the case in many instances, the manure is of- 
 ten reduced nearly one-half in its value. I have seen 
 yards where it was almost worthless, owing to long 
 exposure. 

The farmers of this country need awakening upon 
 the subject of carefully pre.serving their common ma- 
 nures. In Flanilers, where everything of the kind 
 is saved with the greatest care, the liquid manure of 
 a single cow for a year is valued at §10; here it is too 
 often allowed to escape entirely. Either they are very 
 foolish, or we are very wasteful. 

A word of kindness. It is a seed which, even 
 when dropped by chance, is sure to spring up a flow-
