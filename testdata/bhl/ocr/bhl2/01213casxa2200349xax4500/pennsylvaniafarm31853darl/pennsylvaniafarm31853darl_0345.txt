Palmer's Improved Horse Power. 

The annexexed illustration 
 gives a perspective view uf Pal- 
 mer's New and Improved 

I Horse-Power, which, thoupih 
 I ^ I'li originally designed by the in- 
 ventor to accompany his thresh- 
 ing machines, (before describ- 
 ed,) is well adapted and fitted 
 to be used whenever power is 
 needed, and in com))ination 
 with any kind of machinery. 

It is distinguished from horse 
 powers ordinarily in use, by 
 being so constructed that any 
 required length of leverage — 
 from twelve to iweidy-Jive feet — 
 may be obtained and rendered 
 available, and that two, three, 
 iir even a greater number of 
 bands, may be worked at the 
 same time, and thus motion be 

'applied, at one and the same 
 time, to various kinds of ma- 

(ehinery. From the in 'reased 

I length of leverage ob'.ained in 

I this machine over ordinary 
 horse-powers, tlie power applied 
 is rendered much more effec- 
 tive; while at the same time all 
 liability of accident to the user 
 I is removed by the peculiar 
 manner in which the power is 
 transferred, and which is done 
 I without the necessity or use of 
 11 cogs, cog-wheels, and shafts. 
 Power or motion is trans- 
 ferred from the horse-power, by 
 means of bands, or chains, 
 playing in points of support 
 attached to the ends of the arms 
 or levers, liy which arrange- 
 ment the power is not only used 
 I at tlie best advantage — length 
 of leverage being considered — 
 but it is also made availalde 
 without a necessity for cog- 
 vheels or shafts, and, there- 
 • fore, with much less loss from 
 friction. 

By means of a series of coni- 
 cal pulleys on the large wheel 
 i'l r". attached to the horse-power, 

and from which motion is im- 
 parted to any required ma- 
 chinery, different velocities may 
 be given, so that the horse- 
 power may be adapted to different uses, where differ, 
 cnt resistances are to be overcome. 

This improved liorse-power is peculiarly well adap- 
 ted to driving an upright or other saw, wherever 
 their use is desired, as the velocity of the Baw may 
 be readily varied according to the character of the 
 wood or material to be acted on; and such saws will 
 be furnished in connection with the horse-powers, 
 whenever they may be desired. 

These pjwers are also simpl-: in their construction, 
 not liable to get oiit'of order, and may be made (ex- 

cepting the few castings, and the other iron work) by 
 any intelligent farmer or mechanic; and they aro 
 also so framed and put together that they can easily 
 be separated into several parts, and be rendered 
 compact and convenient for transportation or stor- 
 age.
