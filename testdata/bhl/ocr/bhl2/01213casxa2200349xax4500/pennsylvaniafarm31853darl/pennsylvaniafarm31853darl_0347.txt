the glasses should be of some dark color, such as 
 blue, purr le or green, or else opaque, ua the mots 
 shun light, and therefore, do not thrive well in clear 
 glasses. The glasses should be filled with rain, or 
 river water, up to the neck, or so far that the ring at 
 at the liottoui of the bulb only should touch the wa- 
 ter. They should then be put into a dark, warm 
 closet untl the bulb has emitted roots, and the shoot 
 from the crown has grown about half in inch in 
 height; it should then be placed in a shady part of 
 the room for four or five (hi3"s, but not over a mantel 
 pie:e, or near a fire, or in a strong draught of air; 
 and afterwards be removed to a window with a sun- 
 ny exposure, giving air by raising the sash for two 
 or three hours during the middle of the day, when 
 the sun shines. On no account should they be placed 
 outside the window, as the cold harsh whids which 
 prevails at this season effectually check their growth. 
 The water should be changed about once in two or 
 tliree weeks; the glasses should be turned on one side, 
 and the roots partially withdrawn to let the water 
 flow out freely, as, when the roots are wholly with- 
 drawn. It is difficult to replace them without serious- 
 ly injuring them. 

"The single hyneinths are generally the best for 
 blooming iu water. 

"A very pretty effect is produced by growing hya- 
 cinths in moss. For this purpose, an open-worked 
 French basket may be procured, and a lining of moss 
 mo.ss placed inside; a glass or other dish is also to 
 be placed in it, and this dish is to be filled up with 
 moss in which tl c bulbs are to be placed; the 
 is then to be well moistened with water, and the 
 bulbs treated as directed for those grown in glasses, 
 only that an excels of water is to be avoided, as it 
 the water covers the bulljs, they will decay. A rath- 
 er singular effect in also produced b}' taking a rather 
 large sized turnip, and scooping it from the root end, 
 until it is aljout half an inch in thickness, filling up 
 the body of the turnip with mould, and planting a 
 hyacinth in it, a:id then supending the turnip by 
 three ribbons or otherwise. The loaves of the turnip 
 will shootout and turn upwards completely hiding the 
 roots, and making a very pretty vegetable fiowcr 
 pot."

Wonderful Trees. 

Among the remarkable trees in the world, the fol- 
 lowing, of which we have compiled brief descrip- 
 tions, arc some of the most curious. We take it from 
 the Journul of Kibtcaiion: 

T!ic Great Chesiiut Tree. — On the one side of Mount 
 Etna there is a famous chesnut tree, which is said to 
 be one hundred and ninety-six feet above the surface 
 of the ground. Its enormous trunk is separated into 
 five divisicjns, which give it the appearance of several 
 trees growing together. In a circular space formed 
 by these largo branches, a hut has been erected for 
 the accommodation of those who collect the chest- 
 nuts. 

The Dwarf Tree. — Captains King and Fitzroy 
 state that they haw a tree on the mountains ne;ir 
 Capo Horn, which was only one or two inches high, 
 yi^t had branches spreading out five feet along the 
 ground. 

The Sack Tree. — There is said to be a tree in Bom- 
 bay called the sack tree, because from itm.ay be 
 Btripped vci'y natural s:icks, which resemble "felt" in 
 appearance. 

The h'onj-nvt Tree. — The Ivory-nut tree is proper- 
 ly called the Tagua plant, and is common in South 

America. The tree is one of the numerous family of 
 palms, but belongs to the order designated as screw 
 pine tribe. The natives use the leaves to cover their 
 cottages, and from the nuts make buttons and vari- 
 ous other articles. In an early state the nuts con- 
 tain a sweet milky liquid, which afterwards assumes 
 a solidity nearly equal to iv(u-y, and will admit of a 
 high polish, It is known as ivory-nut, or vegetable 
 ivory, and has recently been brought into use for va- 
 rious purposes. 

Tke Urazil-mU Tree, — The Brazil-nut tree may 
 justly command the attention of the enthusiastic nat- 
 uralist. This tree thrives well in the province of 
 Brazil, and immense quantities of its delicious fruit 
 are annually exported to foreign countries. It grown 
 to the height of from fifty to eighty feet, and in ap. 
 pearancc is one of the most majestic ornaments of 
 the forest. The fruit, in its natural position, resem- 
 bles a cocoa-nut, being extremely hard, and of about 
 the size of a child's head. Each one of these shells 
 contains from twelve to twenty of the three-cornered 
 nuts, nicely packed together. And to obtain the nuts 
 as they appear in market, these shells have to be 
 broken open. During the season of their falling, it 
 is dangerous to enter the groves where they abound, 
 as the force of their descent is sufficient to knock down 
 the strongest man. The natives, however, provide 
 themselves with wooden bucklers, which they hcdd 
 over their heads while collecting the fruit from the 
 ground. In this manner they are perfectly secure 
 from injury. 

The Caiiiwn-Ball Tree. — Among the plants of Gui- 
 nea, one of the most curious is the cannon-ball tree. 
 It grows to tlie height of sixty feet, and its flowers 
 are remarkable for beauty and fragrance, and con- 
 tradictory qualities. Its blossoms are of a delicious 
 crimson, appearing in large bunches, and exhaling a 
 rich perfume. The fruit resembles enormous cannon 
 balls, hence the name. However, some say it has 
 been so called because of the noise which the ba 11 
 makes in buisting. From the shell, domestic uten- 
 sils are made, and the contents contain severa' kinds 
 of acids, besides sugar and gum, and furnish the ma- 
 terial for making an e-icellent drink in sickness, — 
 But, singular as it may appear, this pulp, when in a 
 perfectly ripe state, is very filthy, and the odor from 
 it is exceedingly unpleasant. 

The Sornnoful Tree. — At Goa, near Bombay, there 
 is a singular vegetable — the sorrowful tree, so called 
 because it only flour, shes in the night. At sunset no 
 flowers are to he seen; and yet, halt an hour after, it 
 is quite full of them. They yield a sweet smell, but 
 the sun no sooner begins to shine upon them, than 
 Slime of them fall ofl', and others closi? up; and thus 
 it continues flowering in the night all the year. 

Tlic C'uiv Tree. — This tree is a native of Venezuela, 
 South America. It grows in rocky situations, high 
 up the mountains, liaron Von Humbolt gives the 
 following d<^scription of it: — On the barren flank of 
 a rock grows a tree with dry and leathery leaves; its 
 large woody roots can scarcely penetrate into the 
 stony soil. For several months in the year, not a 
 single shcjwer moislons its foliage. Its branches ap- 
 pear deail and dried; yet, as soon as the trunk is 
 pierced, there flows from it a sweet and nourishing 
 milk. It is at sunrise that this vegetable fuuulain is 
 most abundant. The natives are then to be seen hast- 
 ening from all quarters, furnished with large bowls 
 to receive the milk, which grows vellow and thickens 

at the surface. Some drain tin 

bowls under tho 

tree, while o'hers carry luune the juice to their chil- 
 dren; and you might, as the lather returned with this
