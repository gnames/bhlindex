THE HUSBAND'S COMPLAINT— A^4RrETIES OF GRAPES. 

[Decembkb 

milk, fancy you i-aw the f:imily of a shepherd gath- 
 ering around and receiving from hira the production 
 of liie kino. The milk, obtained by incisions made 
 in the trunk, is tolerably thick, free from all acidity, 
 and of an agreeable and balmy smell. It was offered 
 to us in the shell of the calabash tree. We drank a 
 considerable quantity of it in the evening before go- 
 ing to bed, and very early in the morning, without 
 experiencing the slightest injurious effect. 

The B.ead Fniit Tree.- This tree is found on the 
 islands in the Pacific Ocean. The trunk rises to the 
 height of thirty to forty feet, and attains the size of 
 a man's body. The fruit grows to about the size of 
 a child's head. When used for food, it is gathered 
 before it is fully ripe, and baked among ashes, when 
 it becomes a wholesome bread, and in taste somewhat 
 resembles fresh wheaten bread. This is a very use- 
 ful tree to the natives; for, besides its fruit, its trunk 
 furnishes timber for their houses and canoes; thegum 
 which exudes from it serves as pitch for their vessels, 
 and from the fibres of the inner bark, a cloth is made 
 to cover their persons. 

The Upon Tree. — For some ages it was believed 
 that a tree existed in the East Indies which shed a 
 poisoning, blighting and deadly influence upon all 
 animals that reposed under its branches; and that so 
 fatal were its effects, that birds attempting to fly near 
 it, fell to the ground and perished. For several years 
 past, there being no reliable authority that such a 
 tree really existed, it has generally bee i supposed 
 amimg the intelligent to be fabulous, and hence 
 termed the "fabled Upas trco." B..:, u cvr 7 .vi 
 since, a tree was discovered in atiecu.uir 1 .'caiity in 
 the East Indies, which it is believed gave rise to the 
 wonderful accounts of the Upas tree. In the location 
 where this modern Upas tree was discovered, there 
 is a constant and dense collection of carbonic acid 
 gas; consequently all animals that come near it, die 
 by breathing the poisoncms gas. The cause of such 
 a!) abundance of gas being collected in the locality 
 of these trees is unknown. A few months since, a 
 tree was discovered on the Isthmus of Darien, which 
 appears to have a similar influence on animal life. 
 Tiie Panama Star says: — "A man named James Linn, 
 being tired, laid down under a tree to sleep, and on 
 waking, found his limbs and body swollen, and death 
 soon followed." Cattle avoid eating and ruminating 
 under this tree. 

The Tallow Tree.— This tree is found in China. 
 It is called the tallow tree, because a substance is 
 obtained from it resembling tallow, and which is used 
 for the same purposes. It grows from twenty to for- 
 ty feet in height. 

Lace Bark Tree. — In the West Indies is found a 
 tree, the inner bark of which resembles lace, or 
 net-work. This bark is beautiful, consisting of layers 
 which maybe pulled out into a fine white web, three 
 or f )ur feet wide. It is sometimes used for ladies' 
 dresses. 

French Merino Bucks.— Messrs. W. & P. Brady, 
 of Ohio county, Va., shipped from AVIieeling, en Fri- 
 day, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, three of 
 their finest French Merino bucks, and three owes, 
 for exhil.)ition at the Sliryland and Virginia State 
 Faii-s. Among them is their celebrated Gilbert 
 buck, which has so often taken the first premium, 
 and for which, it is said, IglOOO was offered and re 
 fused at the Pennsylvania State Fair. T|-.o clip of 
 this one bu^k alone, last April, was SIJ pounds. 

The Husband's Complaiutt 

RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO ALL WHOM IT CONCERNS, 

I hate the njime of fjerman wool in all its colors bright; 
 Of chal's and stools In fancy work I hate the very sight: 
 The shawls and slippers that I've seen— the ottomans and bags— 
 Sooner than wear a stitch on me. I'd wall; the street in rags. 

I've heard of wives too ninsical, too tailcative, or quiet— 
 Of scoidini; or of (.'aniing wives, and those too fond of riot; 
 But yet, of aii tlio errors iinown which to the women fall, 
 Forever doing fancy work I think e.xceeds tiiem ali. 

The other day witen I came home, no dinner got for me : 

I asked my wife the reason, and she answered. "One. two, three I" 

T told her I was hungry, and I stamped upon the tioor; 

She never even looked at me, but murmured "'One green more." 

Of course she makes me angry, though she doesn't care for that. 
 But chatters, while I talk to her. "One white and then a black :" 
 One green, and then a purple— (just hold vour tongue, my dear; 
 You real ly do annoy me so)~I've made a wrong stitch here." 

And as for confidential chat, with her eternal frame. 
 Thou,'4h I should speak oi Ufty things, she'd answer me the same. 
 'Tis "Yes. love— five reds, then a blacfc—d quite agree with you)— ' 
 I've done this wrong— seven, eight, nine, ten— an orange, then a blue." 

If any lady comes to tea. her bag is first surveyed : 

And. if tiie pattern pleases her, a copy then Is made. 

She stares the men quite out of lace— and when I ask her why? 

'Tis "0! my love, the pattern of his waistcoat struck my eye!" 

And if to walk I am inclined ('tis seldom I go o^t). 
 At every worsted-shop she sees, oh I how she looks about. 
 And says, "Bless nie! I must go in : the pattern is so rare; 
 That group of flowers is Just the thing 1 wanted for my chair." 

Besides, the things she makes are all such touch rac-not affairs, 
 1 dare not even use a stool or screen: and. as for chairs, 
 'Twas only yesterday T put my youngest boy in one. 
 And until that I never knew my w.fe had such a tongue. 

.\lasl for my poor little ones, they dare not move or speak; 

'Tis "Tom, be still; put down that bag. Why, Harriet, where'fl your 

feetF 
 Maria! standing on that stool! It was not made for use: 
 Be silent ail. Three greens, one red, a blue, and then a puce." 

Oh ! Heaven preserve me from a wife with fancy-work run wild. 
 And hands which never do aught else for husband or for child. 
 Our clothes are rent. our bills unpaid, our house is in disorder. 
 And all because my lady wife has taken to embroider, 

I'll put my children out to school— I'll go across the sea; 

My wife, so full of fancv-work. I'm sure cannot miss me. 

E'en while I write she still /.-eeps on her ''One. two, three, and four." 

She'apast all hope. Those Berlin wools, I'll not endure them morel 

Varieties of Grapes. 

Mr. Robert Buchanan, in his recent work on the 
 Grape Culture, gives the following varieties of grapes 
 cultivated in the Cincinnati vineyards, with his views 
 in regard to their relative value ; 

1. The Catawba is our great wine grape, and 
 stanils without a rivixl. Mr. Longworth has offered 
 five hundred dollars' reward for a better native varie- 
 ty, and several new seedling;? have been produced, 
 but its equal has not yet been found. It is subject 
 to rot. 

2. Cape; this old favorite of former days is now 
 almost displaced by the Catawba. It is still cultiva- 
 ted in some vineyards, but not extensively — very 
 hardy variety, and but little .affected by the rot. 

3. Isabella; a variety mucli esteemed in some of 
 the Eastern States, particularly about the city of 
 New York, where it ripens better than here. It is 
 almost abandoned as a wine grape, and generally 
 cultivated only for table use. A hardy variety, sub- 
 ject less to rot than mildew — in some seasons ripens 
 badly. 

4. Bland's Madeira; a delicious table grape, re- 
 sembling the Catawba in its appearance. Too ten- 
 der for vinej'.ard culture in this climate. On iirbor, 
 in sheltered situations, it bears well. 

5. Ohio, or Cigar Box, is a fine table grape, 
 bunches very largo and shouldered, berries small, 
 black, sweet, .and without pulp; does well on arbors 
 or trellises, but will scarcely answer for the vineyard 
 culture — requires long pruning. 

6. L?noir; a black gr:ipo, bunches large and com- 
 pact, sometimes shouldered, without pulp; berries
