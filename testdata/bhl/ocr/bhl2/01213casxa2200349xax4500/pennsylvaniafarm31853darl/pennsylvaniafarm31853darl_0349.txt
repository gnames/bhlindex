emiiU, black, sweet and palatable. Subject, in clay 
 Boils, to mildew and rot. 

7. Missoul'i; fruit black, bunches loose and of me- 
 dium size, berries without pulp, sweet and agreeable, 
 Sometimes cultivated in vineyards. 

8. Norton's Seedling; bunches of medium size, 
 compact shouldered; berries small, purple, sweet, but 
 witli a pulp. 

9. Ilrrbrmont's Sladoira; a good wine and a very 
 pleasant table grape; bunches medium size, berries 
 small, b ack, and without pulp. 

10. Minor's Seedling; a new grape of the Fox fam- 
 ily. Fruit: liunclies medium =ize, berries large, pul- 
 py, musky, and rich flavon^d, very hardy; but little 
 subject to rot. This grape will probably bo found a 
 valuable variety fur the vineyard. 

11. White Cutawlja ; a new seedling from the Ca- 
 tawija, but far inferior to tlie parent. Bunches me- 
 dium size, shouldered; berries white, largo, round, 
 and pulpy; in taste like the Fo.x Grape. 

12. Mammoth Catawba; another new seedling, re- 
 sembling the Catawba in color, but not so well flavor- 
 ed. Bunches large, shouldered; berries very large, 
 round, pulpy; in some aeasons subject -^ fall off be- 
 fore ripening. 

Mr. Longworth, in a letter to the Cincinnati Hor- 
 ticultural .Society, remarks: "I have for thirty years 
 experimented on the foreign grape, both for the table 
 and for wine. In the acclimation of plants I do not 
 believe; for the White Sweet Water docs not succeed 
 as well with me as it did thirty years since. I ob- 
 tained a large variety of Fi-ench grapes from Mr. 
 Loubat, many years since. They were from the vi- 
 cinity of Paris and Bordeaux. From Madeira 1 ob- 
 tained six thousand vines of their best wine grapes. 
 Not one was found worthy of cultivation in this lati- 
 tude, and were rooted from the vineyards. As a last 
 experiment. I imported seven thousand vines from 
 the mountains of Jura, in the vicinity ot Salines, in 
 Prance. At that point the vine region suddenly 
 ends, and many vines are there cultivated on the 
 north side of the mountain, where the ground is cov- 
 ered with .sncjw the whole winter, from three to four 
 feet deep. Nearly all lived, and embraced about 
 twenty varieties of the most celetirated wine grapes 
 of France. But after a trial of tive years, all have 
 been thrown away. I also imported samples of wine 
 made from all the grapes. One variety alone, the 
 celelirated Arbois wine, which partakes slightly of 
 the Cbiimpagno character, would compete with our 
 Catawba. 

"If we intend cultivating the grtipe for wine, we 
 must rely on our native gr.apes, and new varieties 
 raised Irom their seed. If I could get my lease of life 
 lenewed for twenty or thirty years, I would devote 
 my attention to the subject, and I would cross our 
 best native varieties with the best table and 
 wiue grapes of Europe. We live in a great age. 
 Discoveries are daily made that confound u-i, and we 
 kuow not where we shall stop- AVe are told of ex- 
 periments in mesmerism, as wonderful as the 
 grinding-over .system would be; but I fear the discov- 
 ery will Dot be brought to perfecticm in time to an- 
 swer my purpose, and I must leave tho subject with 
 the young generation. 

"I have heretofore w.inted faith in the doctrine of 
 French horticulturists, that to improve your stock of 
 pears, you must not select the seed of the finest fruit, 
 but of the natnral choke-pear. I am half convened 
 to their views. The Cat.awba is clearly derived from 
 the common Fox grape. In raising from its seed, 
 even white ones are produced, but I have not seen 

one equal to the parent plant; and in all, the whito 
 down on the under side of the leaf, and the hairs on 
 the stalk, common to the wild Fox grape, arc abun- 
 dant."

It has been so often said tliat native varieties of 
 fruit are necessarily better adapted l» tlie locality 
 where they grew, because, thus growing, they acnuira 
 characteristics peculiarly fitting them to such place, 
 that the idea his almost p;vs!<ed into an axiom, au<l 
 is assented to by perhaps a large majority of cultiva- 
 tors, and any attempt to advance an opinion at vari- 
 ance with it may appear simply ridiculous. Yot, as 
 everybody in this happy country is at liberty to bo 
 just .as ridiculous, or just as heretical as he pleases, 
 you will doubtless give me leave to say that one indi- 
 vidual does not .assent to it. 

I am reminded of the subject at this time by tho 
 following passage in an article "On raising fruits 
 from seed, in the August num'icr of the IL/rlicul- 
 tnrist : "A variety springing up from the seed, in 
 any given locality, is, in the course of its production, 
 endowed with a constitution and habits a<laptcd to 
 that locality, in a particular manner," &c. Now, if I 
 understand the writer, he means to assert that some- 
 time between the germination of the seed and tho 
 production of fruit, the plant is endowed with its 
 constitution and habits, and that these vary accord- 
 ing to locality. If he does not mean this 1 take no 
 exception to it; but if he does — and what other con- 
 struction can be fairly put on the words "springing 
 up from seed," — I join issue with him and advanco 
 the opinicm that it does not teach tlie f;icts in the 
 ca.se, but that, contrariwi.se, the li.il) ts and ccuislitu- 
 tion are decided or bestowed durhti/ the ytowlh of the 
 wed from which the phmt is destined to spring, and 
 that when this .seed is o, ce matured, it contains 
 wrapped up within it that which stamps indelibly 
 the character of the tree and fruit to grow f.om it, 
 and that the accident of locality, soil, climite, or 
 other, affects only the devclnpement of that character 
 and not the character itaelf. 

It is no part of my attempt to expl.ain the laws 
 which govern the proiluetion of varieties, for I be- 
 lieve that those who have bestowed Uio.-il research 
 into them have the liveliest sense of their ignorance. 
 All I maintain is, that whatever they may be, their 
 operation is at an end before the germination of the 
 seed. We hear no such notions advanced as to tho 
 necessary superiority of native varieties, by practical 
 gardeners, in respect to vegetables. They ta.ie tho 
 utmost pains to procure seed possessing the requisite 
 qualities; but having planted it, do they attempt to 
 change these qualities? Not at all. They labor 
 diligently, and only t ■ secure tho most favoralde 
 conditions for their developemeni, leaving the pro- 
 duction of new and varied properties to successive 
 generations, from seed, and anticipate such changes 
 only in the seed. 

We might ask what is a n.atlve ? The child of Eu- 
 ropcnn parents, born tlie day after arrival hero, may 
 be, technically, a n:itive; but is it the less ot foreign 
 origin ? The Swedish turnip has been grown liero 
 many years, and yet is coinmonly denominated a 
 foreign variety. The Pc.trc. pear grew from a .seed 
 matured in England, and because tha' seed Wiis 
 brought across the water and planted in P-nnsylva- 
 nia it is called a native fruit, and so entitled to con-
