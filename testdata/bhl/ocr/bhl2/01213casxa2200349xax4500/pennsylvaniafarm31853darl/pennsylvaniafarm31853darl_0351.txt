NATIONAL HOUSE EXHIBITION.

The National Horse Exhibition. 

Tlii.s exhibition, the first of its kind in this coun- 
 try, was gotten up, managed, find carried to its con- 
 clusion, in the very best style, and such as our 
 friends in New England only know how to do. The 
 history from the beginning of the whole proeedings, 
 premiums, letters and speeches from public men in- 
 vited to attend, ifcc, occupy one entire number of 
 the Valley Farmer, published at Springfield, Massa- 
 /~ch««etts, the place where it was held. AVhatever 
 they underlake to do, in what is called the "Yankee 
 Nation," it seems to be with the determination to 
 (7o it, and to know no such word as lail, as is well 
 expressed in the following toast, from Gov. Floyd, 
 of Virginia, at the dinner, (for a good dinner, and 
 plenty of invitations to distinguished men, to be 
 present, are considered as a necessary part of the 
 programme in New England,) " Man.iachusKtls Men, 
 and MassacJtusftts Horses. Upon whatever theatre 
 they exhibit, or upon whatever course they enter, 
 they are destined to win, and deserve to win the ad- 
 miration of the American people." 

Letters in reply to invitations were received from 
 William II. Seward, Gov. Clifford, Gov. Seymour, 
 Rufus Choate, Samuel II. Cos, Thomas II. Benton, 
 Edward Everett, R. C. AVinthrop, 0. W. Holmes, Le- 
 vi Lincoln, and many other distinguished public men, 
 some of whom were present, and made speeches. 
 Invitatiotis wore also extended to several hundred 
 editors in various parts of the Union. The exhibi- 
 tion lasted (our days; wo condense from the V.alley 
 Farmer, some extracts, from its report which we 
 think will bo . of general interest, and also two of 
 the speeches made on the occasion, one from 0. P. 
 Ilolcomb, of Delaware, lately returned from Europe, 
 a practical farmer himself of the first order, who 
 can hold the pen, and use the tongue, with as much 
 facility and success as he does the plough, and the 
 other from George M. Atwater, who appears to have 
 been the originator of the Exhibition. 

As regards the inception of the enterprise, the 
 Valley Farmer remarks: That the public might be- 
 coaie assured of the thorough responsibilties of the 
 parties engaged in the exhibition, and of the truly 
 National character and intent of the enterprise, 
 Marshall P. Wilder, President of the United States 
 Agricultural Society, was applied to for the endor- 
 sal and co-operation of that organization. Mr. Wil- 
 der replied in the most cordial terms, and entered 
 enthusiastieally into the plans of the exhibition, 
 promising the attendance and assistance of a dele- 
 gation from that Society, and the publication of the 
 reports of the exhibition in its journal. With funds 
 pledged, the organizati(m of the Board of Managers 
 and General Committee complete, and moving under 
 the cheerfully accorded auspices of the National Ag- 
 ricultural Society, the operations went on with alacri- 

ty. The following are the names of the 

EXECUTIVE OFPICEHS OK THE U. S. AGRICUTTUllAL SO- 
 CIETI'.

Circulars were then issued to breeders and own- 
 ers of horses, and to persons and organizations in- 
 terested in horses, cs, laining the objects of the ex- 
 hibition, naming its organization, stating its rules 
 and regulations and its list of premiums, amounting 
 to $2,501) in the aggregate. These prenuuras, as sta- 
 ted in the circular, varied from S2I)0 for the best 
 ."Stalliim of seven years old, to §20 for the lower grades 
 of mare commun animals. In addition to the pn- 
 nilums offered, a diploma, beantilully designed and 
 executed for the exhibition, was obtained for award 
 to exhibitors who, not winning premiums, still de- 
 served to have the excellence of their animals recog- 
 nized. The design of the diploma is very tasteful. 
 At the top is an allegorical group, representing Com- 
 merce and Agriculture flourishing under the auspi- 
 ces of Peace, and protected by the genius of Ameri- 
 ca, and the eagle of the Union. In each corner i» 
 a spirited engraving; — one exhibiting the Indian 
 mode of hunting the Bufililo; the other reprisenting 
 a Missouri savage holding the wild steed, and watch- 
 ing with amazement the new "iron horse," drawing 
 its rattling train across the prairie. 

The managers of the Railroads centering in Spring- 
 fiel ', with a lilierality :.nd an enlarged view of tho 
 necessities and proprieties attached to the enterprise 
 which do them much credit, co-operated with ih) 
 Committee, by agreeing t'l carry the horses entered 
 for the exhibition over their roads free of charge, 
 and by becoming subsci'ibers to the guarintce fund. 

AV'ith tho good sense and foresight which has so 
 distinguished the managers of the exhibition, it was 
 seen that a mere show of animals, beautilul though 
 they might be, and elor|uent thougli they might bo 
 in proclaiming .-iinie of the objects of tlie exhibition, 
 would still, without the language of human speech, 
 lack that influ-'Utial voice upon the country which 
 would toll most eflectually for the objects of the ex- 
 hibition. It was seen that these objects must take 
 firm in the thoughts of great minds, and achieve a.' 
 concrete shape in those literary moulds where, in 
 this age more than any other, ideas are prepared for 
 the public so as to present at one glance their sym- 
 metry, grace, utility and beautj'. In other words, the 
 exhibition- its olijects, its interests, its spirit, its en- 
 terprise, its trials, its triumphs, and its general aims 
 anil tendencies — must have a voice, and that voice 
 must be uttered upon the spot, and under the inspir- 
 ation of the occasion. To meet this indication and 
 exigency, it was determired to hold upon the gronnds 
 aGRAND Agricultural Banquet, its nmre s(did pro- 
 visions to be graced with the fruits and flowers of 
 the season, from the hands of voluntary contributors 
 in every part of the country around, and to this ban- ■ 
 quet to invite the eminent men of the country — men 
 whose presence wouhl lend dignity to the occasion, 
 and whose speech would give the voice potential to 
 the spirit and objects of the exhibition.
