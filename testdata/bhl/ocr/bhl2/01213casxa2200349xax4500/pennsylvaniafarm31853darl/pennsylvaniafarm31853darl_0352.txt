[Deceuber 

ing. Never sliono a more auspicious and Icindlj sun 
 nn any pnterpi-isc, tlian tliat wliich £;reeted the as- 
 spm'ilinn; multitudo on this occasion. To tllosc wlm 
 labored thniujih weeks of anxiety for the c(.n?nnima- 
 tion so successfully achieved, the pleasure experi- 
 enced was something]; deeper than the emotions of 
 triumph — it was p;ratitude. The slcy was blue above, 
 the sun shone Avarmly throuffh tlie wauzy haze, the 
 flaijs whirl) crowned the tents and every prominent 
 object, linn<; l-\zily upon their masts, and (dd Au- 
 tnmn wore bis b"ightest smile, as unseen fingers from 
 his bejewelled tree ; dropped silently their treasures 
 <)pnn the sround. It was at i cius morninj; — full 
 of hope and exhilaration, and golden with )iriimise. 

On entering; the irrounds at an early hour, the first 
 nbjects that m-t the eye wei-e the members of Eagle 
 Engine Co., No. 1. dressed in uniform, and on duty 
 ns police. At 9 o'clock, the first horse entered the 
 pateway, and from this hour until after ten there 
 was a continued string of arrivals. Some of the 
 liorses were clad in fancy blankets, with their names 
 thereon. The horses coming in to k their position on 
 the central grounds, where they were soon surround- 
 ed by a crowd of admirers. Favorite stallions were 
 playing here and there, each to his little coterie of 
 friends. "Mary Taylor" was there, looking as gaily 
 na she of the Bowei-y. "Cassius M. Clay" was sur- 
 rounded by his political friends. Young "Black 
 Hawk" was there, but without tlie slightest appetite 
 for chickens; "Flying Jloi'gan," but without his 
 wings; "Canadian Leopard," but without his claws, 
 nnd altogether more .Jenny Linds than Otto Oolil- 
 Kchmidt could provide for, were he as industrious as 
 ills wife says he is. Thus tney all poured in and 
 thus assemble{\. and, meanwhile, spectators arrived 
 in considerable numln'rs. 

The Managers and Committees had assembled at 
 the judges' stanil, and congratulations were beard 
 onevery hand. All were delighted, and sm.art things, 
 lunny things, and good things generally were said. 
 One !;entleiniin of a dignified turn of mind thought 
 the horses had a ?iC'/'//iborly way of saluting each 
 other. Another, who had been delighted with the 
 music of the Springfield Brass Band, thought if they 
 AVould play a dancing tune, tliere were several horses 
 that would be happy to "dance a gig." Another, 
 who happened to be given to vivid illustrations, 
 looked upon the clean thorough'bred Virginia race 
 liorso, and testified his pofjr appreciation of her by 
 R.iying that she "looked like an angle worm on 
 legs." 

By the side of the Judges' Stand, a large bell w.as 
 placed, and at 10 o'clo; k this hell was struck. Im- 
 mediately, CiEiiRiiE DicniuT, Cliief Marshal, and his 
 assistants, paraded in front of the Judges' .Stand. 
 The Chief Marshal, as the Presid(nit of the Board of 
 Managers, then addressed M.\RSlt.\T.i. P. AVii.drr, 
 President of the United .States Agricultural Society, 
 who stood uncovered upon the stand, and announced 
 the opening of the exhibition. He alluded to the 
 clrcum-tanccs— the toils, .and trials, an 1 anxieties — 
 that had. attended the inception and growth of the 
 enterprise, and testified his pleasure and gratifica- 
 tion at the haopy consummation. Mr, AVii.der re- 
 plied with brief and appropriate remarks, congratu- 
 litlng the Managers and Committee on the auspi- 
 cious opening of the exhibition, and the admirable 
 arrangements that had been made for it. At the 
 close of bis address, three cheers were called for, and 
 lliev run '■ merrily in the morning air. 

The horses was then called fiu' ti, take their places 
 upon the track, for the grand entree and parade, 

embracing all the liorses, nearly or quite 400 in 
 number. They Were called on by the Marahaljin 
 the f illowing order: — 

1. Stallions of 7 years old and over. 

2. Stallions from 4 to 7 years old. 

8. Thorough-bred Horses. 

4. All Stalli ins of 4 yea,r3 old and under. 
 5 Matched Horses. 

0. Fancy Horses. 
 7 Geldings.

9. Breeding mares wish fo.al at their side. 

10. Ponies. >«v-.^ 

11. All horses entered for exhibition or sale. - 

12. Farm or team horses, 

When all had taken their places upon the track, 
 and Word was given to start, Mr. Wilder called upon 
 the assembly to give thuee ciieees for TnE fir.';'!' 
 N.iTioMAi. Horse Exhibitio.v i\ the World, and 
 they were given with a will. And now was exhibi- 
 ted to the eye the most beautiful and animating 
 scene, wo venture to say, ever witnesses in this coun- 
 try. The horses stretched around the entire half 
 mile circuit, numbering two and three abreast for 
 the whole distance. Some of the horses were attach- 
 ed to skeleton buggies; others to phantom gigs, oth- 
 ers to phjctons and "what nots," of every variety of 
 build and cohir. The air was vocal with the neigh- 
 ing of the splendid animals, who entered into tho 
 spirit of the occasion with as hearty a zest as their 
 owners. And now the scene grew more gay. The 
 fast ones let out a link or two, and went as rapidly as 
 it was safe to do, considering the crowded condition 
 of the track. Gigs went dancing bv'. and fancy hor- 
 ses went their own gr.accful gait. One of the first) 
 objects that caught the eye upon the track was a 
 plinston drawn jiy four splendid Morgan horses, har- 
 nessed with a lavish magnificence of stylo never bo- 
 fore seen in these parts. The establishment belong- 
 to F. T. Cordis of Longmeadow, and elicited univcr- 
 Bal pr.aise and admiration. 

In the grand collection there were upwards of 
 seventy-five stallion, principally representations of 
 the M irgan and Black Hawk breeds. Among this 
 large number of noble animals, it is .always impossi-" 
 ble to individualize. There was tho fiivorite horso 
 Cassius M. Cla)', and his mother who had several 
 ether likely sons present. "Bob Logic," an English 
 thorough bred, "Oscar," all the way from Michigan 
 — a Kentucky horse; the American Eajle, from 
 Flushing. N. Y. — a beautiful bay stallion, and 
 "Clyde Briton," a noble stallion from Canada, 
 Weighing 1,600 pound.s^-and others of equal excel- 
 lence attracted their well deserved share of atten- 
 tion. 

After all had passed twice around the track, mora 
 than half of the horses suddenly pulled off upon the 
 grounds, and i-an races "across lits." This was the 
 most lic^autiful scene of the day. Fr.anconi's Hippo- 
 drome is no more to be compared with it than tho 
 Spunkville Artillery with a rattling, rolling thunder 
 storm. The dumb show of the Crystal Palace, bril- 
 liant and valuable as it may be, would stand no 
 chance by the side of such a sluwof high, active, 
 and rejoit^ing life. All enjoyed it t , the very quick 
 of .appreciation. Standing upon the elevnted seats, 
 and taking in the whole scene at one view — tho 
 throng upon the grounds, the darting, whirling, rat- 
 tling carriages, and the fa.^t horses going around the 
 track at their full gait — one might well exclaim, as 
 hundreds did enthusiastically exclaim, that it ex- 
 ceeded in life and beauty all the lively and beautiful
