NATIONAL HORSE EXHIBITION.

Bccnes within their memory, Ami when it was re- 
 membered tliat (in the ji;roun(ls were the eiiuine re- 
 presentiitiveR (if twenty of thi^ United States, as well 
 as the Canudas, the exhiliitioii appealed to the mind 
 in its trne lieautj' and ma}2;nitnde. 

At 12 o'cliicic, the hell ann(juneed that the hour 
 for the examination and trial of Duaft Horses had 
 arrived. lu this department, the iolluwing was 
 the 

Biiard nf Judges. — Itev. Mr. Sewalt., of Boston, 
 IIiiNRV Fuller, Jr., of 8prin;j;field, Thomas Han- 
 cock, of B(irlin;;ton, N(>w Jersey, IlE.VRy A. Dyer, 
 nf Broidvlyn, Ot., and George P. Dei.ai'Lai.n', of Mad- 
 ison, Wisconsin. 

The exhibition in this department was small — and 
 most inexcusalily small, for the Connecticut Valley 
 alone has abundance of specimens that would show 
 well in any part of the world. There were only 4 
 doulili^ teams entered, and 1 single horse. 

The trial of these horses took place on the north- 
 ern part of the grounds, upon a wagon, weighing 
 1,7011 pounds, and loaded with pig iron to the amount 
 ot a little more than 5,100 pounds. Mr. Trask's 
 liorses led off, taking the load along with ease, and 
 working very steadily. After going twice around 
 the prescribed track, they were unharnesseil, and 
 Mr. Chapin's team took the load, doing their work 
 very (d(Mnly. George Knsworth tried the load with 
 ,a pair of his horses, which had not been regularly 
 entered. Then came M •. Fonda's beautiful b.ay four 
 year old colts. Some of the inm was taken off, for 
 the first time round, reducing the amount to about 
 3,700 pounds. They took this easily, and the secon '. 
 time tcjok the whole load. There w.as s(pmething a 
 little too "hixy" about the movement of the animals 
 for draft horses, hut they demonstrated themselves to 
 he a noble pair of colts. Young Quebec had no ad- 
 vantages for giving a fair test of his strength. The 
 singie wagon was too light for a heavy load, and the 
 horse was in a light breast harness. However, nearly 
 3,000 pounds were put upon the wagon, with which 
 the powerful fellow moved with 'ea.se, and in our 
 opinion, in anything like really favorable circum- 
 stances, couhl have taken the whole pile along. 
 Nearly two hours were spent in these trials, and, in 
 the ui 'antiuie, the crowd had gone home to dinner, 
 and were beginning to congregate for the exhibitions 
 of the afternoon. 

Next followed the exhibition of Breeding M.ares, 
 that of Matched Horses, Colts, Stallions of 3 years, 
 Filleys of 3 years. Stallions of 2 years, Filleys of 2 
 years, Stallions of 1 year, fancy matiihed Horses and 
 Stallions ,.f t to 7 years. Geldings, display of Ponies, 
 and finally thorough breds and Stallions of 7 years 
 old ami upwards. These were all brought out in 
 their regular order at the sound of a bell, and at an 
 hour previously arranged in the prrgramme, for the 
 inspection of the judges. 

Some discussion took place as to what should con- 
 stitute a pony. Wm. S. Kino, of Boston, gave his 
 opinion that ;hc class should embraiw aniuiah; 1-1 
 hands high and under. Dr. E. HhI.mes, of Aie.ine, 
 ditfere.l, and t .ought that 13 hands and undi rsliould 
 constitute the stand. A long and interesting discus- 
 sion lollowcd in which several gentletnen took ]iart. 
 It was alleged that the precedent to be established 
 was an important one. The Exhibition was design 
 cd to encourage the breeding of such horses as it is 
 desirable to raise for use, and the use ol the p(.ny 
 was f(jr training cliildrcu to ride. Solon Robinson, 

the famous "Hot Corn" writer of the New York Tri- 
 bune, then rose, iind gave a lucid aecount of the ponj 
 breed in this country, and showed himself well 
 versed in their history and peculiarities. He statecJ 
 that there was only one distinct and jiuro breed o{ 
 ponies in this country, and these \\cre tlii> Marsh 
 Ponies of South Carolina. These are under KJ 
 hands high. The Canadian horses, known as ponies, 
 are a mixture, of the Indian lurses with French 
 blood. Mr. Robinson enlarged upon the importanca 
 of establishing a Just precedent, and, at the close of 
 his remarks, the President appointed a Committee to 
 take the subject into consideration, and report. This 
 Committee consisted of the following gentlemen: — 
 S(don ludiinson. of New York, George 51. Atwator, 
 of Springfield, Dr. K. Holmes, of Maine, Mr. ilamill, 
 of Phiiailelphia, and W. S. King, of Boston. 

Tliis Committee subsequently reported, through 
 their chairman, Mr. Robinson, and the rep(ut was 
 accepted. It is as follows: 

"The Committee tinally determine, and rceommend 
 to the National Agricullural Society to publish a* 
 their opinion, that no animal of the horse lamily 
 should be termed a pony which does not bear th» 
 distinctive marks ol that breed, — that is, a heavy 
 body, short head and legs, stout neck, with heavy 
 mane and tail, and not over 14 hands high; and that 
 in all offers of premiums for this breed of horses, 
 pure pony blood should be taken into account, more) 
 than size and height, and such crosses of that breed 
 with those fif large growth as come the n(>arest to 
 the origin.-.l idea of a pony, lor which the Sbeilanti 
 should lie kept in view as the type of the ract'i 
 Those not possessed of the distinctive pi^ny marks, 
 whatever their size, should be ranked as small 
 horses, and not ponies."
