The grand Agricultural Banquet came off on the 
 third day. Plates wore laid for 1,773 guests. Mar- 
 shall P. Wilder, the president of the day, assumed 
 the chair, supported on either side by Abbott Law- 
 rence and e.x-Gov. Seymour. From the ma.iy excel- 
 lent speeches made, that of C. P. llolcomb, of Dela- 
 ware, ombracos the most practical information. On 
 rising and being heartily cheered, he said : 

They had sometimes heard of calling "spirits from 
 the vasty deep," but they did not always come when 
 ■called for; and perhaps it would be the better for him 
 to decline responding to the cail they had made, af- 
 ter the eloquevit words to which they bad listened. 
 He had heard the remarks of the various gentlemen 
 with great interest and pleasure, and especially those 
 of our late Jlinister to Kngland (Mr. Lawrence) 
 when he thanked the citizens of Springfield in the 
 name of Massachusetts and in the name of the Union, 
 for this great exhibition. He had no doubt that that 
 was the honest expression of his feeling. It was an 
 occasion of congr.%tulation to the country at large. 
 But, perhaps, as full praise had been given to the 
 citizens of Springfield, and to the value of the stock 
 exhibiied there, they would pardon him while, as a 
 practical farmer, he made a few practical sugges- 
 tions. 

He had gone, as the President observed, the past 
 summer, to England, and a part of his object in go- 
 ing there was to select a horse, and he travelled a 
 great ways, in different parts of the kingdom, for the 
 purpose of ascertaining their condition. He had 
 nmple facilities for his object, having an introduction 
 from Mr. Tattersall, which enabled him to visit sev- 
 eral of the most celebrated studs there. The result 
 was, that he came away without purchasing a horee 
 at all. He wished to tell liis brother farmers what 
 the course of breeding was in Kngland, and to show 
 the result upon the stock, that no American Farmer 
 need go further in the same direction. They were 
 aware that when the English breeders united the 
 blood of the Barb with the Turk and the Arab, no 
 better horses were to be found in the world. They 
 would then run four miles and repeat in 1 40 and in 
 1 24. Now, instead of running four miles and re- 
 peating; they only ran two and three, and did not 
 repeat at all. It was a single dash of two, two and 
 u half, and, at the Derby, of three miles, and that 
 was all. He had told eminent breeders there, that , 

the horses in this country ran four miles and repeat- 
 ed — repeating, sometimes, two or three times. 
 They did not doubt the fact. They said that 
 they had lurmerly such breeds there, but it was 
 not so now. In cuiT iboration of his statements, Mr, 
 H. mentioned that, in a conversation he recently had 
 with his friend from A'irginiit, (Mr. Botts,) ho as- 
 sured him that some horses of the Boston blood ran, 
 the other day, at Ivichmond, four miles in7.4(), 7.4ti^ 
 and 1 A'X They would see in what rcmarkaljle time 
 time the last beat was run — about three seconds long- 
 er than the first. They bad not got any horses like 
 these in England, tliey would l;e very proud of them 
 if they bad. 

Why was this dngeneracy f In the first place, he 
 was very much surprised, on visiting England to find 
 that horse-racing, it it was not the business of the 
 tuition, was a very great amusement. In every city, 
 town and village, tiiey had bettingdiouses, where all 
 the mMiihers of the community, the serving maid as 
 well as the nobleman, entered their bets through the 
 whole year, to be decided when the races came off. So 
 great had this evil become, t.^at a bill was passed, ut 
 the last session of Parliament, designed to ^ ut these 
 betting-houses down. Now, the result of this was, 
 that every attention was paid to getting /leels. He 
 bad stood by the side of two years old colts, tifteen 
 hands high, and he asked his friend, Mr. John Day, 
 how it was possible to make up those colts in that 
 way. Mr. Day told him that they were entered to 
 run at two years old, three years olil, and they were 
 entered shortly after they were foaled, to run at a 
 certain time. The dam was kept as high as possi- 
 ble, and in the paddock there was ft little box, into 
 which the colt could run, where oat meal was placed 
 and oats were always before him. They were stuffed 
 with all the oats they could be induced to eat. The 
 con.se(|ueuce was, that it was quite im'"Ossible thtit 
 they sluiuld have any bone. They run at two, three, 
 and four years old; but at all the races which he at- 
 tended, he saw but one or two entered to run even at 
 five years old, for by that time they were broken 
 down. 

He wished to say there,— since they had come to- 
 gether to speak out freely thoir opinions — what he 
 thought. He believed that they needed to put two 
 inches upon the height of their horses; and those 
 two inches of height the breeders must give. They 
 could do it. They would give them five years — ten, 
 if they wished — but they must put their horses up 
 two inches higher. Gentlemen might say that they 
 were tall enough for some purposes; but what he 
 wished to do Was to supply the luxuries of the cities. 
 The horse, with the citizen, was an article of lu.Kury. 
 They would pay almcjst any price, if the breeders 
 would only get them up to the right height. "Now. 
 gentlemen," said Mr. II., "got your Morgans and 
 your Black Hawks up those two inches?" (Ap- 
 plause.) 

There were two ways of doing this. One was to 
 keep the dam in good condition; let her do no work. 
 Then let the colt lie pressed with oats, say until he 
 was a year old. Up to that point, he conceived that 
 there was no danger; but there they must stop. An- 
 other wad by breeding larger horses upon this stoclr« 
 There must be risk there, but he would try the plan. 
 He would try the pressing system, for every farmer 
 knew if ho gave a calf a little corn, in .addition to 
 keeping the cow in good condition, the animal would 
 grow better and faster than under other circumstan- 
 ces. 

Mr. II. said he understood the value of Southern
