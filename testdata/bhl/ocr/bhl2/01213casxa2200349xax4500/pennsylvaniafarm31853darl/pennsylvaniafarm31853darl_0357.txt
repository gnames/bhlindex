but I think that the sentinii'iit thus exprcfspil, and 
 the iiuthorities givnn, will exdnrvule those who tiie 
 in earni'st in regard to thi8 sulijeet, iVoiii the imputa- 
 tion (if being elevated upun the stilts ut an exaggeia- 
 ted zeal. 

The account in the Farmer ooneUules thus: — 
 The representation of the press at tlie banquet 
 was very large, there being probably more tiian 
 filty editors and reporters present. Tliere were 
 more than thirty reporters together, on one line of 
 talile.s. 

The Railniads during the hxst week did a tremen- 
 dously large business, and thry have thus found 
 their account in tbeir liberality. It is calculated that 
 not less than 30,000 strangers visited tlie city during 
 the week. 

It may interest some to know the exact number of 
 entries as they appear on the Secretary's books, and 
 ■wc give them : Thoroughbreds 7, Stallions 7 year« 
 and over 50, Siallions of 4 years and under 7 34, 
 Geldings 13G, Breeding Mares 53, Breeding Mares 
 with foal at side '.I, Matched Horses 33, Fancy ditto 
 16, Stallions and Filli<'S of 3 yi-ars 19. of 2 y<>ars 
 10, of 1 year 7, Farm and Draft Horses G, Ponies 21. 
 The total number of entries was 407, covering, as we 
 reckon it, 472 animals. 

In looking over the list of entries, we findlliat the 
 Morgan and Black Hawk breeds prevailed in the 
 exhibition to an extent far beyond what we^upposed 
 to be the fiiet. Id many cases, the breeds are not 
 distinctly stated — or present such mixtures .as not to 
 belong to a distinct family. Among the breeding 
 mares, we find 22 Morgans, 8 Black Hawks, and '» 
 Messengers; among the Geldings, 31 Morgans, 11 
 Black Hawks, 9 Messengeis. 4 Hanibletonians, Eng 
 lish and French 3 each. Among the stallions of all 
 ages, there wsre 50 Morgans an(l 22 Black Hawks. 
 It will thus be seen that the Morgans were very 
 larg(dy the leading family, while the Black Hawks 
 were second on the list. 

The gross receipts of the Fxhibition were nearly 
 $10,OL)0, and the sum received will bo just about 
 enough to pay expenses. The leading items of those 
 expenses are, the premiums, amounting to about 
 $3,000, to which will probably be addeil many gra- 
 tuities, over and above thi-isum, bestowed upon line 
 horses p'-esent from a distance; the ereetinn of the 
 high board fence around the lot and the building of 
 the stalls and feats, which cost Sl20(lor $1500; print- 
 ing and advertising; the banquet and the entertain- 
 ment of invited guests. A large amount of niimir 
 expenses, many of which could not have been <iire- 
 seen, and even now must be indefinitely estimated, 
 were incurred. The Managers were lilKval in their 
 arrangements, in proportion as the certainty of suc- 
 cess enabli'd tiiem to be. The receipts for entrance 
 fees for hor;-es amounted to from §1,000 foS1.71tO. 
 and liefween §1,OUO and $1,200 were taken for tick- 
 ets to the banquet. The balance of receipts is from 
 entrance fees Irom spectators. 

We thus close the history of one of the most inter- 
 esting exhibitions on record. It is the history of a 
 fine idea entirely realized. The exhibition wa? sin- 
 gularly exempt from accident, and from those riotous 
 demonstrations so often attendant upon exciting pub- 
 lic occasions. Professicmal rogues were attracted 
 here, of course, and several persons suffi'red from 
 depreditions upon their pockets. But the beautilol 
 horses, and the crowds of nu-n and women, have 
 come and gone; may a goud influence have gone 
 forth with tbein, which shall tell for good upon all 
 tbeir iutcrcsit! 

SujKr Pliosphate of l,ime. 

We extract tno following directions, how to make 
 the i.bdve article, on the farm, from the "American 
 Agriculturist." In many parts i)f the country, par- 
 ticularly in file interior near towns andvilKages, Bones 
 can readily be collected which are now allowed to 
 waste, and article made from them at Imme, much su- 
 perior to some of the nostrums now advertised as 
 fertilizers. 

T<i make Stipcr-Pho.tphafe of Lime. — Some bones, 
 some oil of vitriol, (sulphuric acid,) and some wood- 
 hooped barrels, or ball-barrels, or bnlf-bogsheadp, 
 are all the apparatus needed. Bones are everywhere 
 to be found. Offer some of the i<lle boys in your 
 neighborlxjod five to ter e 'lits a bushel for hunting 
 them up, and you will so'-n cry, enough for the pre- 
 sent! Join two or three of your neighbors and send 
 lo the nearest large town, and get a few carboys of 
 sul]diuric aciil. These carboys hold from 120 to 180 
 lbs., and by stipulating to return the carboys, you 
 can generally get the acid for two to three cents a 
 pound. For casks, take old musty meat barrels, or 
 tight molasses hogsheads, sawn in two in the middle. 
 The half-barrels, or half-hogsheads, are most conve- 
 nient lor use. For operations on a small scale one 
 or two will be sufficient. 

Put into the barrel a quantity of water, and pour 
 in some acid. The acid should be added in small 
 portions at a time, and the mixture be allowed to cool 
 before more is added, as great heat is produced by 
 mixing the acid and water. You want about two 
 and a half quarts of water for one quart of acid; 
 strict accuracy, however, is not necessary. XJae a 
 pitcher, or other earthen vessel, for measuring the 
 acid and water. Having put the water and aciii into 
 the barrel, you may now put in as many bones .as you 
 can punch down into the liquid, which should first 
 he crusiicd tolerably fine. As the bones settles from 
 time to time put in more. Let this stand from six 
 to twelve weeks, stirring it upwell with a stick every 
 two or three days if convenient, and you will have a 
 liquid super phosphate of lime as good as can be 
 made. When you wish to apply it to the land, pour 
 out the liquid, leaving the undissolved bones still in 
 the barrel, and mix the liquid with some nnleached 
 a hes, sny two cpiarts of ashes to a gallon of the li- 
 quid; and then mix the whole thoroughly with alarge 
 (|uentity of dry muck, charcoal dust, well rotted dry 
 manure, or even with any dry soil, and it is re;idy to 
 be sown upon the field broad-cast, or put in hills or 
 drills with the seed. If put in direct contact with 
 the seed, be sure to have it first well mixed with a 
 larije quantity of muck or other substance, say two 
 or three gallons to a cartload. The mixing can be 
 done with a shovel on a floor or even on the ground. 
 Til nialic fiiijiniri'il Siiprr jihusjihiiU.- Make tlie 
 super-phosphate just as above described, and instead 
 of the ashes, or in addition to them, add a gn'ateror 
 less quantity of urine, or the liquid from the manure 
 heap, and then dry with muck as before. The more 
 urine or manure drainings you add. the more i/h- 
 priitni, or the richer in ammonia, will be your prep- 
 aration. 

The above process is rery simple, though we have 
 used a good many wonbi is describing all the par- 
 ticulars; and with little tna.ble yiai can maki^ filty 
 dollars worth of first-rate super phosplmle, or im- 
 proved su]ier-phos|diale. 

Cditd'oii. — In handling oil of vitriol, be careful to 
 have none get upon your bauds, face, or clothes. Thi&
