Digging Machiucs. 

New Implemeni. — A spirited ilisciission on the 
 merits of agrioultuval imiilenionts is one of the results 
 of free trade in griiin. In former days the plough and 
 the harrow were the capital stock of many farmers. 
 The drill, the horse-l.oe, the scarifier, and the culti- 
 vator are of more recent times. It would appear 
 now tliat the plouj:)! is to bo superseded by a digijinj;; 
 machine. I am one of those who tliink we plough 
 too much, and that the plou','w will give place occa- 
 sionally to implements of ninre general utility; but 
 that it will be superseded is out of the question. All 
 implement^ employed in agriculture should have 
 these requisites; they should be simple in structure, 
 strong enough for all descriptions of soil, and be ap- 
 plicable to general cultiTati(ru. The plough has these 
 requisites, but the slow progress it makes does not 
 keep pace with the spirit of the age; it must and wiil 
 therefore partly give place to implements that will 
 perform a greater breadth of work in a given time. 
 All implements that till the ground may be termed 
 euUivat(jr8; but as yet there are few of this class that 
 are really efficacious, and of general use. I noticed 
 at work last «eek an impl mentof the cultivator or- 
 der, which, from the simplicity of its structure, and 
 its great power, led me to examine it; it consisted ot 
 three open iron beams in parallel lines, with cross 
 beams at either end. At the tail end of each beam 
 18 tixed a strong tine or sha'-e, much in form like 
 the tines of the Ducie cultivator, fastened by double 
 bolts, with a screw to adjust the depth of working. 
 In tlie front are fixed three small wheels on thethree 
 beams, and from the tines are three draught rods 
 po'nting in the direction of the horses' ooll.ars, bring- 
 ing the draught power direct from the tines. The 
 field in which the implement was at work was alean 
 stubble of the strongest clay, wellmatted with Couch 
 Grass, 10 acres in extent, and formed two sides of a 
 deepi-ih vallej', and the work was made up and down 
 the hill, witli eight hor8?s. The tines buried them- 
 selves in the ground about 7 inches, and tore up the 
 retentive soil in a most mast 'rly manner, and scat- 
 tered or rather shivered the pieces in most admired 
 confusion, leaving the field in a fit state to be opera- 
 ted upon by a lighter implement going across the 
 work. The ((uantity of work done in the day was 
 five acres, and consequently the 10 acre piece, which 
 would have required ten ploughs with lour horses 
 encdi for one day, was completed with eight horses 
 and one implement in two days— a saving in labor 
 to the amount of 1^4 horses in one field; and what is 
 of more importance, the great advantage to the land 
 in being moved in dry weather. On inquiry I learnt 
 that the implement was mode. led and manufactured 
 by M:-. W. Smith, of Little Woolston, near Newport 
 Pagnel. who is a proprietor and practical farmer 
 and that he has taken out a patent for it. Now, 
 whether this implement is perfect or not, time will 
 show; but I am quite satisfied th.nt to gain sufficient 
 power to work our strong clay soils, the implement 
 must work under the surface and not over it. It 
 seems to me quite impn-sible that sufficient power 
 can bo had, even by the aid of ste.am, to till the 
 fi;round by rotatory means, and I fear the enterprise 
 and ingenuity and zeal of our friend Mr. Mechi will 
 fail to accomplish the laudable objeet he has in view, 
 and also that the digging machines v^ill shortly 
 slumlicr amongst the many speculative implements 
 which may be seen resting from their labors in the 
 Bheltcr hovels of our most enterprising agricultur- 
 ists.

National Agriculture. 

The total v.alue of the annual products of the soi 
 of the United States is now about One Thousand 
 Millions of Dollars; and no one who knows what 
 Science /(Oi- done im Agriculture will doubt that the 
 same amount of Labor wliieh is now employed in 
 producing this aggregate might be so applied as to 
 secure a total product thirty per cent, greater, or One 
 Thousand Tliree Hundred Millions. But scientific, 
 skillful, thoi-ough Agriculture always employs more 
 than the shiftless, slouching sort too generally pre- 
 valent ; and it is certainly within hounds to estimate 
 that our Agriculture might be so improved as, by the 
 help of additional labor now unemployed and unpro- 
 ductive, to give an additional product of fifty per 
 cent., or Five Hundred Millions per .annum — an 
 achievement which would double the wealth of the 
 country every eight or ten years. Whosoever will 
 carefully review the Agriculture of a single State, or 
 even an average County, in any part of the Union, 
 and estimate how much its product might be enhanc- 
 ed by Irrigation, Manuring, Deep Plowing, Draining, 
 &c., will perceive that out calculation is far within 
 the truth. 

But suppose that only h;>lf of it, or an addition of 
 Two Hundred and Fif^y Millions per annum to our 
 annual Agricultural product, is attainable, what an 
 immense addition to our national wealth would there- 
 by be insured ! Four-fifths of this would proliably 
 be permanently added to the wealth of the country — 
 th!it is, the farmer whose annual product should be 
 swelled from §1,000 to §1,250, or from |2,000 to 
 52,500, and would not eat or drink the surplus, but 
 would invest the greater part of it in new buildings, 
 fences, barns, implements, furniture «fec., &e., giving 
 profitable employment to mechanics and h^borers and 
 largely increasing the business of merchants and the 
 income of professional men. Such an addition to the 
 annual product of our Agriciilture would increase 
 the consumption of Manufactures, domestic and im- 
 ported, in far greater ratio, since from the annual 
 product of every farm the food <jf those making a 
 living on it must first be taken for home use, afford- 
 ing no business or profit to any one else, leaving only 
 the surplus to form the staple of trade; and an addi- 
 tion of twenty five per cent, to the annual product 
 of each farm "would probably double the annual ex- 
 exchanges and general trade of the country. — N. Y.

Improve Spare Minutes. 

To be really and practically industrious, one i^ust 
 improve those minute particles of time, known as 
 "spare minutes." Of all portions of our life, these 
 spare minutes are the most fruitful for good or evil, 
 and arc literally the gaps through whicli temptation 
 finds access to the soul. Spare minutes are g(jld 
 dust of time, said Young; sands make the mountains; 
 moments make the year! Idleness wastes a man as 
 insensibly as industry improves him: evil deeds and 
 evil thoughts never creep upon him who is assiduous- 
 Iv employed upon good ones. The mind and b(]dy 
 both require activity to keep them pure and healthy 
 in action. Like water, if it runneth tree, it is pure and 
 wholesome; but what is there more nois me and pes- 
 tilential than a stagnant jioul? Diligence of itself 
 alone is a fair fortune, and industry is a good estate 
 to have and to hold. 

The better animals can be fed, and the more com- 
 fortable they can be kept, the more profitable they 
 arc — and all farmers work for profit.
