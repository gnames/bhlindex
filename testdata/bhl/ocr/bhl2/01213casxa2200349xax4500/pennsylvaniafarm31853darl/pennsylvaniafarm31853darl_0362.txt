WORK FOR THE MONTH.

there as well as other trees. An acre of Quinces, 10 
 feet apart, will admit of 430 trees, which will com 
 mence bearing about the third year after being 
 planted. Very little pruning is required, save when 
 young, to make the trunk strait, and form a round, 
 symmetrical head. The fruit is produced from the 
 little twigs or spurs on wood two or three years old. 
 The same general principles of management are ap- 
 plicable as to other fruit trees, and without which it 
 will be in vain to expect fine fruit. Perhaps more 
 than any other, except dwarf pears, the Quince should 
 be supplied with manure, dug in each fall, the conse- 
 quent rapid growth to be regulated by the shortening 
 in process. 

Th? experience of the best cultivators proves that 
 salt is a specific manure for the Quince tree, promo- 
 ting growth and thrift remarkably, in a short time. 
 About two quarts should be applied to each tree, or 
 it may be sown broadcast, ten bushels to the acre. 
 The Philadelphia market is seldom supplied suffici- 
 ently with Quinces. We recently priced some tempt- 
 / ing specimens, fair, large and smooth, and were told 
 fifty cents per half peck. ^They generally range from 
 $1 to $2 per bushel, according to quality, and a 
 Quince orchard in full bearing will yield two to four 
 bushels per tree, at a moderate estimate. From the 
 facility of picking, the expense would be less than 
 any other fruit, the transportation to market much 
 safer, and we believe the clear profit from an acre be 
 greater than that from any ordinary three acres of 
 corn, oats, wheat or potatoes. 

Work for the Mouth. 

Farm. — Before ground is too frozen, and while teams 
 are in better condition than they will next Spring, 
 plow and subsoil, especially on heavy lands, the 
 fields for coming crops of corn; attend to stock in 
 barnyard: provide sheds for shelter; fodder judicious- 
 ly with straw, corn-fodder, and occasionally hay; re- 
 membering it is easier to keep them in a thriving 
 condition, that to get them into it. Cows and young 
 stock should be well cared for in well ventilated sta- 
 bles, and supplied with a few carrots, beets, or tur- 
 nips each day; use the card frequently. Have water 
 always at hand, and two or three lumps of rock salt 
 in the yard for stock to lick at pleasure. Economise 
 hay -and straw by use of straw-cutter Corn fodder 
 should also be cut, before feeding, and if no steamer 
 is a hand, empty the tough end of the stalks, or buts, 
 which will generally be refused by the cattle, into a 
 large hogshead, into which pour boiling water, and 
 cover the top. After being softened by this process 
 feed, with a little bran or meal sprinkled over. Have 
 manure, as it gathers in bam-yard, collected under 
 a rough shed in centre of yard. Provide some soil, 
 or muck from swamps, which mix through it as 
 heap is forming, and give occasionally a sprinkle of 
 plaster. Prevent drainage from passing ofi', by col- 

lecting liquid in a pit at one end, which should oc- 
 casionally be pumped up, and poured or watered 
 over the surface. Manure saved in this way is worth 
 at least fourfold more in spring, than where it is 
 scattered over yard, and exposed to weather. Col- 
 lect and house carefully all tools and farming uten- 
 sils. Open the mouths of drains and ditches. Avoid 
 turning stock into pasture fields in soft weather. — 
 Secure corn cribs from mice. Haul fuel when ground 
 is frozen. Give plenty of litter, either strawor leaves 
 from woods, to all stock, cattle, horses, sheep, and 
 swine. For the latter boil small potatoes, pumpkins, 
 and any refuse vegetables. 

Fruit Orchard. — Attend to general directions of 
 last month. Bank up the earth around your trees 
 to keep off mice. Dig in manure, or guano when 
 ground is not frozen. Take advantage of open wea- 
 ther, to prepare for spring planting, by deep plow- 
 ing ■end subsoiling. Where the object of pruning in 
 young trees is to promote growth, now is the proper 
 time. The amount of food collected by roots through 
 winter ie thus confined to remaining branches, in- 
 stead of being distributed through tree and lost. 

Fi.owER Garden. — The principal work for garden 
 in this month, will be cleaning borders and decayed 
 plants and weeds, renewing walks, tying up to stakes 
 and protecting half hardy plants and shrubs. Run- 
 ning roses should be secured firmly to their stakes 
 or trellisses, to preserve them from being broken by 
 storms. Chromatellas, Solfatares and such likeroses, 
 not perfectly hardy, should be well covered with straw 
 or cedar boughs. Teas and other dwarf varieties 
 may be protected with cedar boughs tied together at 
 the top. Mulch well all roses and plants with short 
 manure- Tie up junipers and other bushes with 
 straggling branches. 

Persons wishing early blooming plants in spring, 
 may keep them through winter in cold frames. Dig 
 out a hole a foot deep of size required, and fit in a 
 box, sloping to the south if p.ssible, two feet deep at 
 back and 18 inches in front, bank up earth from 
 the bole on outside, and lay a bed of coal ashes in bot- 
 tom, to make drainage and prevent ingress of worms. 
 Cover with sash, and protect in severe weather with 
 straw mats and shutters. Verbenas, Primrose, Poly- 
 anthus, Pansies, Petunias, &c., will keep nicely in 
 this way, and bloom early. Forward annuals in pots 
 by placing them in frames early in spring. 

See that plapts in windows are not killed with 
 watering. The only rule for this is appearance of 
 soil in pots: water only when it appears dry. Keep 
 them near light and turn round occasionally. The 
 farther plants are from light give the less water, 
 change water in hyacinth glasses, every week orten 
 days. 

Vegetable Gardens. — Attend to directions of 
 last month. Finish covering with straw or litter, 
 everything that needs protection. Commence com-
