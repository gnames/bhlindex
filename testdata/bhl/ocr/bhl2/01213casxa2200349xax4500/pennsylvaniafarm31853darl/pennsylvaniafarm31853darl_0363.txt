The successful exhibition at Pittsburg, having we 
 presume replenished the treasury of the State Agri- 
 cultural Society it occurs to us that the approach- 
 ing winter, a season of comparative leisure with far" 
 mers, might be well employed in engaging a compe- 
 tent person or persons to make a tour of the State- 
 particularly in those counties where Agricultural So- 
 cieties are established, and deliver kcftars, not only 
 on Agricultural and Horticultural subjects, but also 
 ■with the view to establish and cement a more inti- 
 mate union, and correspondence between the State 
 and County Societies. "We cannot say e.\actly that a 
 screw is loose here, but it is wanting altogether. It 
 has never existed. An effort was made by our friend 

and county Societies. The subject may perba] 8 be 
 brought before the annual meeting in January. 

Franklin county Agricultural Society. 

We are indebted to Col. McClure, treasurer of the 
 above society, for a copy of the Franklin AVhig, pub- 
 lished at Chambersburg, containing a full account of 
 their recent exhibition, (the first one) with a list of 
 the premiums and reports of the committees. We 
 extract the following account from its editorial col- 
 ums, which says: — - 

The display of articles on exhibition was truly as- 
 tonishing considering that it was tlie first eS'ort of 
 the Society, and immensly curtailed by the weather. 
 Every variety of Stock was on han<l, and some of the 
 very best specimens. The array of agricultural Im- 
 plements was good, and the departments of Domes- 
 tic Manufactures and Fancy Articles would compare 
 favorably with many of the older Societies. Indeed, 
 in every branch of industry the representation was 
 most creditable; and the admirable spiritwhich seems 

to be infused among the farmers, mechanics and ar- 
 Judge Jessup, (whose sagacity and foresight reaches tizans of Franklin county, bids fair to place our Ag- 
 far ahead in such matters) during the first exhibition ricultural Society and our Exhibitions at once in 
 at Ilarrisburg, to promote this object to some extent, | the very front ifank of such associations in Pennsyl- 
 vania. 
 I According to the regular programme, the address 
 should have been delivered on Wednesday; but as 
 to the State Exhibition. It was approved of at the ! the roads and ground were in a bad condition on that 
 evening session then held but that was the last we \ day, it was (lostponed until_ Thursday ^yith the hope 

by suggesting that premiums be awarded to such lo- 
 cal societies, as made the most liberal contributions 

have heard of it. 

Wo think much good might be accomplished in the 
 •plan proposed by us. provided one or more compe- 
 tent persons could be found to undertake it. Although 
 much has certainly been done, our farmers in Penn- 
 sylvania as a general thing are not yet roused up to 
 the improvement of their Agriculture. The foolish 
 prejudice against what is called Book Farming, still 
 exists in many places, (as if a truth, were any the 
 less one, from being printed or written.) Informa- 
 tion is wanted to bedisseminated asto what has been 
 done, and what may be done, to increase aggregate 
 and individual wealth, by scientific cultivation, im- 
 provement of the breeds of Domestic animals, intro- 
 duction of new seeds, improved implements, manures, 
 &c. There are a thousand matters, relating to the 
 culture of the soil which might be discussed and 
 brought bfure the farmers to great advantage. Sam- 
 ples of wheat and other grain, new seeds, ifcc, might 
 be taken around, by tlio lecturer, their history ex- 
 amined, and adaptation to particular sections eluci- 
 dated, also models of improved machines. The for- 
 matiou of clubs of practical farmers in the different 
 townships might be promoted to meet at stated 
 times ami inspect the management and culture of 
 each other's farms, &c. This has been found highly 
 useful in many places. 

At present in Pennsylvania, whatever interest is 
 excited by the annual fairs is allowed to slumber, for 
 the succeeding year. The intermediate period is 
 one of comparative inactivity so far as regards any 
 eflfort to disseminate iuformation, both with the State 

that the attendance would be larger and the grounds 
 more comfortable. But the steady rain on Thursday 
 rendered it necessary to adjourn from the grounds to 
 the Court House to hear the address. Accordingly at 
 2 o'clock the peo^ile assenildcd in the Court House; 
 when David F. Robison, Esq., delivered a most elo- 
 quent and instructive speech on the advancement of 
 Agricultural Science. He was greeted with raptur- 
 ous applause. As he was notified but a few days be- 
 fore the address had to be delivered, he could not 
 comply with the request of the meeting to furnish 
 a copy for publication. We hope, however, to be 
 able to publish extracts from it. Hon. George Cham- 
 bers, President of the Society, rose then to announce 
 the premiums; and in a few preparatory remarks he 
 alluded very pertinently to the rapid strides now ma- 
 king to advance every department of science. He said 
 he had been a member of an Agricultural Society in 
 this county some 30 odd years ago, which in active 
 members eventually dwindled down to himself, a 
 few other lawyers and the Prothimotory of the coun- 
 ty. Then, he said, there was not a steam vessel in 
 this country; now there are over 3,000; then there 
 was a not rod of railr.ad in the U. S.; now "'c have 
 lO.QiJO miles of it. And he was glad that the great 
 science of Agricultun' was no longer to stand still 
 while other less important sciences are advancing with 
 astonishing rapidity. Speaking of the tine varieties 
 of stock at the exhibition, and especially of hogs, he 
 alluded to a long-legged, jaunt monster specimen ex- 
 hibited at one of the old fairs in this county; and the 
 discussion in committee was whether the Society 
 should not buy the hog and kill him as a matter of 
 favor to the owner and tlu^ community, instead of 
 awarding a premium for him! 

On lociking over the premiums, awarded we find 
 there was quite a list of horses on theground;also Dur- 
 ham, Devon, Ayrcshire and Teeswater cattle, Bakcwell 
 sheep; Esses, Bedford, Berkshire and Chester Coun-
