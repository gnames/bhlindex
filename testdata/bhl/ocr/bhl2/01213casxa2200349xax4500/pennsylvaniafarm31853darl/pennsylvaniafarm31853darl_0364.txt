ty pigs, a fine display of improved Poultry; also But 
 ter, Cheese, Vegetables, Fruit, and a gfeat varietv of 
 Agricultural Implements. Some elegant necd'e and 
 fancy work were also contributed by the Ladies. The 
 ground on which the exhibition was held appears to 
 have been purchased by the society for its purposes, 
 and the fences, buildings, stalls, &c., all put up the 
 present season, involving a heavy outlay. This looks 
 like permanency and is well worthy of imitation, 
 umler the circumstances of the unfavorable weather, 
 and its being a first effort, we think Fr.anklin coun- 
 ty has done nobly. The number of members on the 
 Treasurers book is 739 a'ready, which will no doubt 
 be increased by another year. Much credit is given 
 to the Hon. George Chambers for his exertions on 
 the occasion. At the close of the exhibition, an elec- 
 tion of officers was held for the ensuing year, which 
 resulted as follows: 

President — AVili.iam IItyser. 

Vice Presidents — John Orr, .James Lowe, Jaraes

Choice rules in Breeding Stock. 

We cxtractthe following from "Cline's observations 
 on Domestic animals," which are well worth attend- 
 ing to. In passing an opinion upon the high prices 
 of fine animals, we are too apt to forget, that the ex- 
 cellence of form they exhibit, is not the effect of mere 
 chance, but very often results only from the anxious 
 care and skill, and perseverance of years. '/ o breed 
 atroi/ exceptionable points, and supersede them with 
 those of (/»<a; value, to fix in the animal icndcncies 
 and peculiarities, such as the disposition to lay on 
 fat in certain places, fineness of bone, milking quali- 
 ties, size, early maturity, &c., is altogether an uphill 
 business, in which the reri/ feio only succeed, an'l in 
 which a thorough scientific knowledge of animal an. 
 atomy and physiology, and years of close observation 
 are required. When the happy results are before us in 
 the living carcase, we admire and are apt to exclaim 
 how very simple, easy and beautiful. Like as with 
 fine specimens of art, the labor of execution is not ap- 
 preciated. One of our greatest poets, on one of his most 
 beautiful and easy flowing passages, being spoken of 
 and he congratulated on the apparent ease, and ra- 
 pidity with which he wrote, replied that very pas- 
 sage cost me months of anxious thought." 

A siugle injudicious or unfortunate cross may un- 
 do tlie hiljor of years. Biikewell was several gener- 
 ations by the most careful selections before he brought 
 his sheep up to his desired standard, of fattening at 
 an early age, with a small consumption of food, and 

with a small amount of offal. The present Jersey 
 cows, are the result of at least 12 years of effort. Two 
 beautiful cows were .about that time ago selected by 
 the lieutenant Governor of the Island, one was con- 
 sidered perfect in her barrel ar.d forequarters, the 
 other equally so in her hind quarters, and from these 
 two, a scale of points, was .adopted, consisting of 33 
 for bulls, and 36 for Cuws and heifers. So long ago 
 as 1800, they were acknowledged to be su^jerior for 
 milk and butter, and having been bred withthis view, 
 ever since, as well as for the improvement of their 
 original form, the tendency in these particulars, may 
 be said to be fixed and heredit.ary. Without pursu- 
 ing the subject farther ourselves .at present, we refer 
 the reader to what Cline says. All experience proves 
 he is correct, that the female should be the largest. 
 "Dam the best," as our friend J. Pedder used so 
 often to urge. 

"Although the form of domestic animals has been 
 greatly improved by selec'ing with care those pos- 
 sessed of the best shape for breeding, yet the theory 
 of improvement has not been so well understood, 
 that rules could be laid down for directing the prac- 
 tice in every case; and although the external fi.wm has 
 been much studied and the proportions well ascer- 
 tained, theso are but indications of (»fc™a? structure, 
 — the principles of improving it must, therefore, be 
 founded on a knowledge of the structure and use of 
 the intrrniil (larts; and of these, the lungs are of 
 the first importance; it is on their size and sound- 
 ness that the strength and health of an animal 
 principally depend, the power of converting food into 
 nourishment being in proportion to their size, an an- 
 imal with large lungs being capable of converting a 
 given quantity of food into more nourishment than 
 one with smaller lungs, and thercfure having a great- 
 er a])titu(le to fatten. The external indications of the 
 size of the lungs are, the form and size of the chest, 
 but a (hep chest is not capacious, unkssit be propor- 
 tionally broad 

"Thejuc/c/i- is the cavity formed by the junction of 
 the bauiicb-bones with the bone of the rump, and it 
 is essential that this cavity should be large and ca- 
 p.acious; its size is indicated by the width of the hips 
 and the breadlb of the twist — which is the junction 
 of the thighs — the breadth of the loins being always 
 in pro)iortion to that of the chest and pelvis. The 
 bead should be small; the length of the neck in pro- 
 portion to the height ol the animal; the muscles and 
 tendons large, the strength of the animal depending 
 more on the muscles or tendons than on the bones; 
 many animals with large bones are still weak, and 
 those that are imperfectly nourished during their 
 growth, have their bones often disproportionaly Large. 
 A compact, round made body, a deep, full chest, a 
 broad loin, full fiatik and straight back, a sm.iU 
 head and clean chaps, with fine tapering neck, limba 
 and bones not coarse and Large, a soft but not thick 
 skin, with soft and fine hair, are amongst the chief 
 marks of a good kind. 

"It has been generally supposed, that the breed of 
 animals is improved by the largest males; this opin- 
 ion has done considerblo mischief.and probably would 
 have done more, if it bad not been counteracted by 
 the desire of selecting animals of the best form and 
 proportions, which are rarely to be mi'twitli in those 
 of the lan/est size; experience has proved that cross- 
 ing has only succeeded, in an eminent degree, in
