those instances in wliicli tlio females were larger tlian 
 in the usual pniportidu uC females to males, and that 
 it has Generally failed when the males were dispro- 
 portiiinately large. If a well-formed large huek be 
 put to small ewes, the lamlis will not bo so well 
 ehaped as their parent; but if a go(jd amull buck be 
 put to larger owes, the lamlis will be of an improved 
 form: the improvement depends on this prineijile, 
 that the power of the female to supply her offspring 
 with nourishment, is in proportion to her size ancl to 
 the power of nourishing hers'df from the exeellonee 
 of her constitution. The size of the foetus is general- 
 ly in proportion to that of the female parent, and 
 therefore, when she is dispropurtionally small, the 
 quantityuf nourishment is disproportionally small and 
 her o(l>priiig has all the dispropoiiioHs of a starve- 
 ling: Ijut when the female, from her size and good 
 constitution, is more ailequate to the nourishment of 
 a foetus of a male smaller than herself, the growth 
 will be proportionately larger, the larger female his 
 ftlso a greafci tpiantity ol niilk, and her otl'>pring is 
 more abundantly supplied with nourishment after 
 birth. To produci' the most perfeetly-formed animal. 
 Bhundant nourishment is necessary from the earliest 
 period of its existence, until its growth ia complete. 
 "To obtain animals with large lungs, crossimj is 
 the most expeditious method, because well-formed 
 fmales may be selected, from a v iriety ot a large 
 size, to be put to a well formed male that is rather 
 smaller; — by such a mode of crossing, the lungs and 
 iieart beeome larger in consequence of a peculiarity 
 in the circulation of the fretus, which causes a larger 
 proporti(,n of the blood, under such circumstances, 
 to be distributed to the lungs than any other parts of 
 the body, and as the shape and size of the chest de- 
 pends upon that of the lungs, hence arises the re- 
 iiiarkably large chest, which is produced by crossing 
 villi females that are larger than the males: but this 
 practice must be limited, for it may bo carried to such 
 an extent tliat the bulk of the body might be so dis- 
 proportioned as to the size ot the limbs, as to prevent 
 the animal from moving with sufficient facility, so 
 thaf, whi'i-e activity is requir'd, this prtictice must 
 not be extended so far as in those which are intend- 
 ed for the food of num. The kinds of animals selec- 
 ted f(U' cross-breeding ought never to be of vcr>i dif- 
 fcent habits and sizes, for notwithstanding the con- 
 fc«He<l advantages derived from cioss-hre(!ding, yet, 
 great or siiddi-n changes arc highly improper, that 
 having often been liiuml injurious to the health and 
 character of the stock; the use of the bucks of the 
 pure Dishley or Bakewell stock has with several 
 Cnarse flocks of sheep, been attended with no sensible 
 advantage, owing to this cause, the characters and 
 li:ibits of the breeds being so wiilely dissimilar. 
 Whenever, then, cross-breeding i.s attempted, care 
 ought always to be taken to do it gradually, and to 
 rear the progeny in a proper manner; and when 
 the matching is conducted ] rogr ssively, and with 
 due atti'ntioii to the diversity (d'h:ibit in theaninnvls, 
 it succeeds well, the chef art being, to begin grad- 
 ually at first, and in process of time, as the blood 
 of line family is diminished, that of the other will be 
 increased, till improvctnent to the degree wished 
 for be attained by gradual appriiximalion. 

"The great improvement of the breed of horses in 
 England arose from crossing with those diminutivn 
 Ftallions, Uaibs and Arabians; and tin' introduction 
 ol Flemish " ares was the source of improvement in 
 the larger breed of cart horses; the form of the swine 
 has also been greatly improved by crossing with the 
 euiall Chinese boar; but when it became the fashion 

in Londcm to drivi> large "bay horses in carriages, tho 
 farmers in Yorkshire put their marcs to muidi larger 
 horses than usual, and thus did infinite miscdiiet to 
 tlu'ir breed, by producing a race of small-cbestej 
 long-legged, large boned, wnrthh ss animals; and a 
 similar piojoct was adopted in Normandy, for the 
 purpose of enlarging tln-ir breed of horses, the u.se 
 of the Ilolstein stallion, by which tbi^ best breed of 
 horses in France would have been spoiled, hajl not 
 the farmers discovered their inisl;d;e in time, by ob- 
 serving the offspring much inferior in form, to thafi 
 produced by their own horses."

Bedford County Exhibition. 

Mt. D.\li,as Farm, Nov. 1853. 
 J. L. Darlingtov, Esq. 

DeakSiR: — The second annual exhibition of tho 
 Bedford County Agricultural Society, was held in the 
 borough of Bedford, on Tuesday and Wednesday, 
 October 18th and T9th. Several tliousaid people 
 were present, and all seemed delighted with the dis- 
 pl.ay made by the fanners, mechanics, and ladies of 
 our county. The exhibition was held in the Court 
 House, jail yard, and public square, and never be- 
 fore were those places so crowded, at least not tho 
 jail yard. 

In describing a Fair it is rather difficult to know 
 where to beg'n. But since Bedford county takes 
 great pride in her horses, and can successfully com- 
 pete with any other county in the State in a display 
 of these animals, I will first notice the show made in 
 this department of the exhibition. The hor,ses ex- 
 hibited numbered between two and three hundred, 
 and there was not a mean one in the whole number. 
 Our horses are generally iron-greys, mostly of tho 
 breed called by our farmers, "the wild-inctllc," tliimgh 
 they are perfectly tractable, yet spirited. AVc also 
 have many bay horses, depcended from the old Ca- 
 nadian stock, which, crossed in with our mountain 
 horses, has made a breed of good size, great endu- 
 rance, and beautiful appearance. Onr horses fre- 
 quently bring from two to three hundred dollars, 
 even before they are well broken, and these prices 
 are paid by farmers and persons who buy then, for 
 .actual servic, and not by the yonng bliiads of llio 
 cities, wdin purchase horses, generally, to make a 
 "splii-f/e" at fictitious prices. Taking ini consiile- 
 ration the limited means of our society, the prciiiums) 
 (SIO) on hor-ses, was quite liberal. 

The display of cattle was also good, considering 
 that our county is not particularly adapted to rais- 
 ing fine looking catlle ; the climate being ratlierco(d, 
 and our winters generally long and cold. Had we u 
 convenient outlet for our pio luce, our county would 
 certainly excel in daiiy proi'.u;;e and wucd growing ; 
 for it is partii u'arly sui'cd to both these branehes 
 ol the rural art. Charles Smith, .Joseph Diehl, 
 iind John G. Ilirtley exhibited some fine Durham 
 ca tie, the majority of which had every appearance
