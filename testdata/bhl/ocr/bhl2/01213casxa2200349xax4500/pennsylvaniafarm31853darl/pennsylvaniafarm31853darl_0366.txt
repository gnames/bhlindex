IMPROVED POULTRY-IMrORTATION OF STOCK. 

[Decemeer 

of being full bred. H. Ickes and Wm. Hartley ex- 
 hibited several Devon cattle. Besides these there 
 Were a great many fine native cattle on exhibition. 

Cliarlcs Smith and J. Diehl exhibited several pens 
 of Southdown, Cotswold, and Leicester sheep. 

Wm. & J. G. Hartley exhibited some fine pigs, 
 cross of the Suffolk and Dutchess, and Suffolk and 
 Berks line, from the pens of Adrian Cornell, of Bucks 
 county. G. D. Trout exhibited Yorkshire, and II. 
 Dibert Chester county pigs. 

Of course there vras a good display of Shanghaies, 
 Chittagongs, Cochin China, and other fovrls. 

Though we had a remarkable dry sea- on, yet there 
 was a large display of vegetables and grain of va- 
 rious kinds. The grain was very heavj'. Wm. 
 Hartley exhibited one bushel of blue stem wheat, 
 weighing 1Â»9.] lbs., and J. G. Hartley one bushel of 
 Mediterrean wheat, weighing 68 lbs. I suppose there 
 was over twenty bushels of wheat exhibited, by as 
 many different persons, all of which ranged from 
 <><j toGOl lbs. As there was a great deal of anxiety 
 felt as to whose would weigh the most, the committee 
 meafiured and tccigJied each bushel carefully. Rye 
 exhibited by G. W. Smith weighed 04 lbs., and oats 
 by A. Compher 42 lbs. 

The dairy and Mechanical interests, were well 
 represented. There was also a picture gallery con- 
 taining the portraits of our old oitieens, many of 
 whom arc dead, also all the fine paintings, engravings 
 &o., which could be collected in the t wn and sur- 
 rounding country. 

But the display made by the ladies, surpassed even 
 the exhibition of the State Fair at either Ilarrisburg 
 or Lancaster. 

Only one more article and I am done. You may 
 have heard of a car-break lately invented by Michael 
 Shimer of our county, as its name implies it is inten- 
 ded to break the momentum of a train of cars, when 
 running with their greatest velocity; it is said this 
 contrivance will stop a train of ears running at their 
 usual rate, within from 10 io 20 feet without conms- 
 swn. It has recently been tried on the central r^ute 
 and proved satisfactory to the most sanguine expecta- 
 tions of every body, who witnessed, it, and it will 
 confer lasting honor on the inventor should it come 
 into general use, which it will do no doubt. 

Mr. Shimer was the original inventor of the Spaik 
 Catcher., but reaped no reward from his invention.

For the Farm Journal. 
 Improved Poultry. 

The season of our great Agricultural Fairs having 
 past, and numbers of improved animals having 
 changed hands, will it be asking too much, to request 
 for publication, in the Farm Journal exact accounts 
 of profit and loss. 

Why have we not heretofore frequently had, in 

this county, such accounts? Let them be made with 
 as much care, as the State Society requires, for field 
 crops or the produce of cows. 

Is not that the best animal, that will give the great- 
 est product of labor, carcase, butter or eggs, in the 
 shortest time, with the least food? Would not such 
 data, be most important for Chicken committees, in 
 making their awards? Would it not be well for our 
 society to bear this in mind, when "getting up" the 
 next schedule of premiums? Is not that exhibitor 
 best entitled to a liberal premium, who gives well 
 attested evidence of the most productive poultrj'? 

To you then who are in the "fancy" let me urge 
 the propriety of keeping strict account of cost of 
 stock, quantity, quality, and price of food consumed, 
 number, weight and "qu.M.ity" of eggs and chick- 
 ens produced in a given time. 

The public then need not long be in doubt about 
 the best varieties or manner of keeping. 

Please begin now or with the beginning of the 
 year or at any time to suit your convenience, and 
 at our next Autumnal exhibitions, have such an 
 array (f facts as shall redound to the credit of 
 yourself and county, whatever it may do for Shang- 
 hai's, Black Spanish, Java's, Dorking's, Mr. T's. fa- 
 vorite Chittagongs or any other variety with ci with- 
 out remote ancestors." J.
