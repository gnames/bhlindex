PRIZE ESSAY ON PIGS— BORROWING TOOLS.

takes place with the sow, the symptoms of such are 
 similar to those of approaohiog paturition, but more 
 intense. When this is likely to take place, a veteri- 
 nary surgeon, if within call, should be requested to 
 attend. As a general rule, a sow ought not to be al- 
 lowed to breed alter she has entered her fifth year, 
 nor boars after the seventh. 

Swine are troubled with several diseases, the most 
 common being a species of leprosy commonly known 
 by the name of measles, which, and the other more 
 serious diseases, would require a separate treatise to 
 do justice to the subject. 

In conclusion, it may be remarked, that swine- 
 breeding might be carried on more profitably, and to 
 a larger extent, were farmers to avail themselves of 
 the facilities of railway communication which are 
 now afforded, of either forwarding live pigs or as 
 dead meat to Smithfield, Leadenhall, and Newgate 
 salesmen, or by slaughtering bacon-hogs and con- 
 verting the carcases into ham and bacon, using the ofFal 
 for home use. Many respectable salesmen in New- 
 gate and Leadenhall would willingly take charge of 
 small quanties, say 20, 40, or 100 sides, and would 
 realise for the farmer, generally speaking, very re- 
 munerative prices; for this purpose, however, the 
 sides or hams should be perfectly cured and dried, 
 and invariably smoked. 

It was intended to have concluded this paper with 
 the immediately preceding observations. I am in- 
 duced to continue these remarks, having found that 
 my suspicions respecting the breed known as Lord 
 Western's improved Essex were fully justified, as 
 that nobleman, in a letter addressed to the late Earl 
 Spencer, observes — 

"To descend from the horse to the lowest animal 
 in estimation, though perhaps not the least valuable, 
 namely, the pig. It appears to me that an important 
 change and improvement have already taken place 
 in some districts in the breeds of this animal to a 
 considerable extent, and which is further progressive 
 in other parts of the country. This has been ac- 
 complished by a breed commonly called the Neapoli- 
 tan, which race is found in its greatest purity in that 
 beautiful peninsula, or rather tongue of land which 
 lies between the bay of Naples and that of Salerno. 
 It has very peculiar and valuable qualities; the fla- 
 vour of the meat is excellent, I should say superior 
 to that Lf any other breed, and the disposition of the 
 animal to fatten on the smallest quantity of food is 
 unrivalled. I have so completely engrafted this 
 stock upon British breeds that I think my herd can 
 scarcely be distinguished from the pure blood." 

Long prior to the letter being written of which the 
 above is an extract, Arthur Young, in describing a 
 flock of Southdown sheep at Mr. Howard's, near 
 Bury St. Edmunds, incidentally alludes to that gen- 
 tleman's hogs, which are stated to have been obtain- 
 ed from Mr. Western. He (Arthur Young) states 
 that they had considerable merit, and mentions one 
 specimen, a fat sow that did not breed, as remarka- 
 ble. This pig was —

Borrowing Tools, 

It is an old saying that "he that goes borrovring, 
 goes sorrowing;' and a still older one, "the borrower 
 is servant to the lender." But so far as applies to 
 farm tools, Yankee ingenuity seems tj have reversed 
 these sayings, for one of the greatest annoyances cf 
 some neighborhoods is the necessity of lending tools. 
 "AVon't you lend me your cart to-day?" "I want to 
 borrow your crow bar." "Can'c you let us bave 
 your drag?" "Father wants to get your oxen." "I 
 want half a dozen of your new bags," &c., are usual- 
 ly followed by long searches for lost bags, half days 
 spent in getting carts and harrows repaired, &c. 
 "Why, father, Mr. Dumplin said he would pay for 
 that cart if you would get it mended." "He would, 
 indeed, would he, — this would cost him about one- 
 fourth of my loss of time in going to him for it, and 
 taking it to, and returning it from the blacksmith 
 shop, to say nothing of throe days delay in getting 
 my work done ?" "But, father, that's a great deal 
 better than Mr. Sugarplum did when he borrowed 
 our cultivator, for when he broke it, he swore at you 
 behind your back for lending him such a "rotten ma- 
 chine," and wouldn't never pay a cent." 

'John Where's the crow bar?" "I don't know, 
 sur, I've hunted for it a good deal for two or three 
 days." "Have you looked in the barn?" "Yes, I 
 hunted all through the barn, and the carriage house, 
 and the corn house." "Have you asked Jim?" 
 "Jim, haven't you seen the crow bar nowhere?" 
 "Why, ^es, I saw it at bquire Noodle's; he borrowed 
 it one day when you was gone away, to pry up a 
 barpost, and it's been stickin' there ever since." 

Every farmer should have a full set of implements 
 and tools, and have a place for every thing, and every 
 thiny in its place. If he has not the means, let him 
 sell off a corner of his farm to procure them. — Se- 
 lected. 

False Shame.— Some people appear to be ashamed 
 to have it known that they have to "work for a liv- 
 ing." But they are not ashamed of the foolish pride 
 that originates that shame, yet their pride is to 
 them a greater disgrace that the greatest degree ol 
 virtuous poverty and honest labor. No greater evil 
 could befall most young men and women than to be 
 relieved of the necessity for labor, as the records of 
 criminal courts, prisons and poor houses show. The 
 chances are much greater that young men who are 
 from necessity compelled to toil for a living will 
 grow up and become respected members of society, 
 than those who grow up in idleness, with a fortune 
 at their disposal. While the former are engaged in 
 earning a reputation and competency, the latter are 
 scattering their substance in idleness and sloth.

Uo NOT begin farming by building an expensive, 
 house, or erect a spacious barn till you have some- 
 thing to store in it.
