Selecting Breeding Rams. 

It is the peculiar province of ram-breedera to breed 
 stock rams for the use of common flock-breeders; and 
 this mode of breeding has many advantages to both 
 parties. The ram-breeder can afford to procure and 
 put to his flock of ewes better animals, and, of 
 course, more expensive ones than would answer the 
 purpose of an ordinary breeder to use. In this way 
 the ram-breeder is enabled to keep up a more select 
 and valuable flock, from which he can let or sell ani- 
 mals of a truly valuable character to breeders for 
 common use at a lower rate of prices: besides, it is 
 also his peculiar province to look out for and intro- 
 duce every practical improvement into his flock of 
 which it is capable, by judicious selection from the 
 flocks of other approved breeders, and in a groat 
 measure regardless of cost — the district depending 
 upon him expects these things of him; and if he is a 
 man of judgment he will not fail them. He knows, 
 or ought to know, the pedigree of every animal of 
 his flock; and in this way he can and does suit any 
 change of blood or feature to the wants of the flock. 
 In thiis way he can also suit his friends or customers 
 desiring or finding it requisite to change their blood 
 or intermingle it in their flock; by his peculiar flock- 
 marks he can on application recommend this and 
 the other animal as changes from the usual selection 
 of his friends, thereby rendering it unnecessary for 
 them to resort to other breeders, which is at all 
 times a dubious course to adopt; it is far better to 
 keep to a flock you well know, and to the judgment 
 of a breeder on whom you can de;,end : the breed- 
 ing will not be running too close by following this 
 practice. 

Breeders should be v:ry cautious in selecting 
 their rams. The requirements of their flock of ewes 
 should be particularly noticed, and a careful separa- 
 tion of them made before hiring, so as to ascertain 
 more accurately their precise defects, and to point 
 out with greater certainty the peculiar kind of ram 
 necessary to rectify these defects; this should bo done 
 before procuring the ram — not to hire first, and then 
 try and suit the ewes to him ivfterwards. Never liire 
 or purchase a ram from an unknown flock. An in- 
 ferior ram from a flock of well Icnmon repvte will 
 produce better stock than an accidental good one from 
 an inferior flock. By all means keep to a good 
 strain; adhere to flocks of well known and deserved 
 celebrity; you are far more certain as to the result. 
 There may be, and often is, much foolish fastidious- 
 ness in breeders relative to slight peculiarities in 
 good aninlals; a spot, slightly discoloured leg, or 
 some little defect, is greatly magnified. These are 
 of minor importance in good animals to common 
 flock-breeders — they are important to ram-brecd<?rs, 
 and are generally, if not universally, avoided: but 
 no ordinary breeder need reject a good ram for a 
 slight peculiarity; they will seldom be propagated 
 in the flock, particularly if taken from a good 
 stock. 

Hiring and Sale. — It is always better fbr a breed- 
 er to hire a ram than to buy one, provided he is 
 guaranteed a good season with him. Rams "now-a- 
 days" are so highly kept, so pampered, that vast 
 numbers of them are very defective stock-gcttcrs. 
 On this account it is better to hire than to buy. 
 Shearling or yearling rams are undoubtedly the 
 most active amongst the ewe flock, and are mostly 
 sought after by Hock-masters, but a good two-shear 
 ram is to be preferred, if of known character. The 
 ftliearling may prove right, and all you could wish; 
 the two-shear ram is already proved; besides, his 

proportions are developed, and you know to a cer- 
 tainty what he is as a sheep. Experienced ram- 
 breeders will generally hire a two-shear or even old- 
 er sheep on this footing; it must not with them be a 
 matter of doubtful character, and an old sheep well 
 proved is to them a certain security for future bene- 
 fit. 

A shearling ram is generally supposed to be fully 
 equal to serve from 75 to 80 ewes; but a two-shear 
 ram sliould not have m<u'e than 70 to 75. In all 
 cases, the breeder hiring should see that his rams 
 are in every respect right and active before putting 
 them to his ewes; much disappointment and loss 
 often arise from these omissions. 

In making choice of a ram to suit the ewe flock 
 regard should be had to every requirement; neither 
 "wool nor mutton" ought to take precedence— both 
 must be held of equal value. If any quality is to 
 be discontinued, or of necessity to be given up for 
 the time, let it bo beauty or symmetry, or some mi- 
 nor points; these are truly good in their place; but 
 for these never give up the main qualifications — a 
 good fleece, a fat back, and a full symmetrical pro- 
 portion, of great substance. 

In making choice of the ewes to put to each ram, 
 much may be done to improve the flock. No breed- 
 er can find just the ram he wants — the very ram to 
 suit his whole flock; he must therefore have the same 
 due regard to what he most requires, and put bis 
 owes to them accordingly. A "ram-breeder" will. 
 very properly put his choice owes to the best ram, 
 in order to obtain the best offspring; but a "common 
 breeder" may vary his ewes as as to procure his 
 flock of like make and proportions — a short-legged 
 ram to a long-legged ewe: a full-chosted ram to a 
 narrow-chested ewe; a heavy woolled ram to a light- 
 woolled ewe; and so on as his best judgment dictates 
 endeavoring to obtain from the male what is want- 
 ing in the female. 

In breeding what are termed half-breeds great care 
 should be given to obtain rams from good flocks, or 
 the end to he answered in making such stock quick- 
 ly off is defeated. The very best of rams should bo 
 used, possessing every good qualification of wool, 
 mutton, and symmetry. It is quite a mistake to 
 fancy any ram will do for half-breods; no such thing. 
 We know of h.alf-bred sheep remaining as long or 
 longer on fattening pastures than many much heavi- 
 er and less likely feeding-sheep. If half-bred sheep 
 are to retain favor with tlio grazier, they must be 
 bred with every care and attention to the many qual- 
 ifications. Many breeders use ram lambs for this 
 purpose; this is wrong, no breeder can tell what a 
 lamb is to make in his future life. In all cases, use 
 the best ram or the best kind of ram you can ob- 
 tain, and be not too nice about the price. I have 
 known many flocks of lambs make from 'is. 6d. to 
 7s. per head more than otliers of the like size, solely 
 from better and more correct breeding: and the dif- 
 ference is far greater as tlicy grow up, and are fat- 
 tened. — Farmer's Magazine.
