TIIORNE'S IMPORTATION OF DURHAMS AND SOUTIIDOWNS. 

[Decembeb 

Thome's Importations of Uurhams aud South- 
 downs. 

We extract the follow ing interesting letter from 
 the Cultivator, concerning these late importations 
 into New York. It is cause of general congratula- 
 tion all over tl)0 country, that "Grand Duke," cost- 
 ing ?5000 in England, and probably the finest Dur- 
 ham bull ever brought to this country, is safely 
 landed after a most hazardous voyage. To the great 
 liberality and public spirit of J. Thorne, in invest- 
 ing so much in these superior animals and bringing 
 them to our shores, the whole country is under last- 
 ing obligations. The prices paid were within the 
 reach of but few, and the patriotic feeling which 
 prompted the effort to secure them for our own coun- 
 try, without regard to cost, is worthy of all praise. 
 The possession of these choice animals will enable 
 us to turn the current of trade and export io, instead 
 of importing from England. We feel more anxiety 
 to see and handle "Grand Duke," than to visit the 
 Crystal Palace : 

Respected Friend — I now have on my farm, some 
 choice Short-horns and South Down sheep of my 
 own importation. To give thee some idea of the 
 stock I am about importing, I take the liberty of 
 adding some particulars relating to it, and some ex- 
 tracts from letters I have received from Francis M. 
 RoTcn of Morris, Otsego county, who, as thee may 
 know, is now in England, making selections of stock 
 for me. 

In addition to the South Down buck, (1'2) secured 
 at Jonas Webb's Letting, 11th July, at 130 guineas, 
 and the two pens of prize yearling South Down 
 ewes, shown before the Royal Agricultural Society 
 of England, by Mr. Lugar, Mr. Rotch selected from 
 Mr. Webb's flock, fifteen yearling ewes and five old- 
 er ones (the latter as an especial favor. ) Ho has 
 subsequently added the first prize pen of yearling 
 South Down ewes, shown at the York (England) 
 Agricultural Fair, by Lord Walsingham. Mr. Rotch 
 remarks of them — "I was really tempted to take 
 them. They are a beautiful lot." 

In connection with the ewes purchased of Mr. Lu- 
 gar, Mr. Rotch says — "It is to be remarked that Mr. 
 L. is the only breeder, with one exception, who has 
 succeeded in winning both the first and second pri- 
 ces, with yearling South Down ewes at the Royal 
 Agricultural Society's Fairs. A breeder who can 
 win with ten of his ewes, ought certainly to stand 
 higher than the one who wins witli only five. Mr. 
 L. was my competitor at Mr. Webb's, lor the buck, 
 (112)."' 

Of Short-llorns, Mr. Rotch writes— "The Bates' 
 bull. Grand Duke, (10,284) is a superb animal, and 
 to my thinking the best in Engl.ind; his handling 
 cannot be surpassed. He is a true Duchisss bull, 
 with all their cliaracter and quality." Subsequent- 
 ly ho writes — "1 have purclmsed the Bates' buil. 
 Grand Duke, decidedly the best bull in the world ! 
 at the long price of 1000 guineas. He looks every 
 inch a Bates, and is grand in size and appearance, 
 with a majestic carriage." Grand Duke was pur- 
 chased of S. E. BOLDEN. 

Mr. Rotch also purchased of Mr. Bolden, at 100 
 guineas, "Peri," a roan yearling heifer by Grand 
 Duke— dam, Pink, by Id Duke of York (5959) — 
 grand dam, Marygold, by Raspberry, (4875) &c. 

"You will see she has two crosses of the Duchess 
 blood; then she goes to Booth's Raspberry, he being 
 the sire of his famous cow Faith, mother of Hope, 
 and she of Charity, his prize cow, thus going back 
 to his best blood." 

From Mr. Tanqueray he purchased "Aurora," a 
 two-year old heifer, at 150 guineas. In speaking of 
 her before making the purchase, he says — "I think 
 Mr. Tanqueray's heifer, Aurora, by 3d Duke of 
 York, one of the most desirable animals; she looks 
 very like a Duchess." 

From Mr. Townely he has secured two heifers, 
 "Frederica" his choicest, two years old, at 300 guin- 
 eas; color red — sire, Upstart; dam. Feathers, by Duke 
 of Cornwall, &c. She is far advanced in gestation, 
 and was only shown at the York fair this season, 
 where she was a winner. "Llalah Rookh," his 
 choicest yearling, at 400 guineas; color red — sire. 
 The Squire; dam by Prince Earnest, &c. This heifer 
 was winner of the first prize at both the York (Eng- 
 land) and the Irish shows, the only two at which 
 she was shown this year. Mr. Rotch says — "Her 
 pedigree is fu'l of winners, and she is undoubtedly 
 the most beautiful creature in England." In speak- 
 ing of prices he adds — "Mr. Townely frankly told 
 me I had asked for their best animals; that they did 
 not wish to sell, and nothing but an enormous price 
 would tempt them." 

At the late Earl Ducie's sale, thee is aware of his 
 purchase of Duchess 59, roan, 5 years old, dam 
 Duchess 56, at 350 guineas. 

Duchess 64, red, 4 years old, dam Duch- 
 ess 55, at 600 " 
 Duchess 08, red. 11 months calf, dam 
 Duchess 64, at _ 300 
 In speaking of this sale, Mr. Rotch remarks — 
 "There was a large gathering of about three thou- 
 sand persons. The average price of the animals 
 sold, was double that at fBates' sale ! I think I 
 could have taken 300 guineas for my bargain be- 
 fore I left the ground! Mr. Bolden was besieged by 
 several bidders, to send cows to Grand Duke, but 
 put the price up to one hundred guineas a cow — on 
 your account, of course!" 

Mr. Rotch was disappointed in not getting Duch- 
 ess 66, (her dam Duchess 55,) which Morris & Be- 
 CAK were fortunate in securing at 700 guineas. Had 
 Mr. R. secured this Duchess, it would have given me 
 all the Duchess cows Earl Ducie left, that have bred 
 of late years. 

The buck (112) and a part of the ewes have come 
 to hand, and fully an&wer my most sanguftie expec- 
 tations. They are doing finely. The balance of the 
 stock I do not expect until .about the first November.

To Make Yellow Butter in Winter.^-PuI in 

yolk of eggs just before the butter comes, near the 
 'termination of the churning. This has boon repeat- 
 edly tried, and it makes very fine sweet butter. It is 
 kept by many as a great secret, but its great value 
 requires publicity. 

To Cure Poll Evil in Horses. — Mix copperas and 
 hogs lard, and simmer over tlie fire in an iron pot; 
 witli ihis rub the part afleeted plentifully two' or 
 tliree times a week and let the hot sun drive it in. 
 The application should be made before the disease- 
 has gone too far. Mind to keep rubbing till a cure 
 is effected : it takes time.
