We are reminded ol this important item of farm 
 expenses by a recent article in the Boston Cultivator, 
 ■which copies some statistics on the subject from an 
 address by Nicholas Biddle, some years ago, before 
 the Philadelphia Agricultural Society, We recollect 
 being present when this address was delivered. The 
 portion of it relative to the cost of fencing excited 
 considerable attention at the time among the far- 
 mers, and is as appropriate, if not more so, now. It 
 Bays: 

"But the most serious grievance in our farming, 
 an'd one to which I ask your special attention, is our 
 very bad system of fencing. When the country was 
 first settled, it was natural in felling the timber, to 
 enclose with the logs the clearing, just as in New 
 England, the stones on a farm may be as well form- 
 ed into a fence, as carried further. But as wood be- 
 came scarcer, the expense has increased, till now it 
 has become a real oppression. I have heard of a 
 farm surrounded by a cedar fence, which would ac- 
 tually sell at auction for more than the farm itself. 
 A most respectable member of our society has as- 
 sured me that the fencing of his farm, of perhaps 
 300 acres, cost him 5,000 do'lars. The extent of this 
 burthen in Pennsylvania will surprise you all, as it 
 astonished me when 1 came to make this calcula- 
 tion, which is of course very rough, but as I give 
 the elements of it, you must rectify its errors. 

The whole surface of Pennsylvania is said to be 
 i8,000,000 of acres. Deduct for unenclosed lands, 
 what seems to be a large allowance, say 18,000,000, 
 and there remain enclosed in a post and rail fence, 
 10,000,000. The size of the lots into which they 
 are subdivided, varies; near large cities and towns, 
 the lots are of a very few acres — in remoter places 
 they are larger, but for convenience I have assumed 
 as a basis of calculation, that the sub-divisions of a 
 Pennsylvania farm are on an averaga about 10 
 acres. 

Now, to enclose a field of ten acres, you have on 
 each side 660 feet, and calling a panel 10 feet, you 
 have 66 panels on each side, or 264 panels to go 
 round the whole — but as every panel serves for an 
 enclosure on each side, the number of panels should 
 be reduced of course to one-half: so that, upon a 
 large scale of enclosure, every 10 acres requires 132 
 panels of fence. Now 10,000,000 of acres, thus di- 
 vided into fields of 10 acres, amount to 1,000,000 
 fields, each of which requiring l.'!2 pnnels, the whole 
 amount of panels is 132,000,000. The price of a 
 panel varies in difierent parts of the State; here it 
 would cost one dollar a panel, but taking the aver- 
 age at eighty cents a panel, we have ?105, 600,000, or 
 in round numbers, §100,000,000. Consider now the 
 interest on this outlay, the wear and tear of the 
 fence, and that the wlxole of it will not last more than 
 10 or 1.5 years, and you have as the annual tax upon 
 agriculture in Pennsylvania, the sum of 10,000,000 
 of dollars. If this estimate appears still too hij!:h, 
 red'.iee it one-half, and you have still a tax of 95,- 
 000,000. 

Look at it in another point of view. See how 
 many post roads, private roads and lanes there arc, 
 with a row of fonoos on each side — ?co.how every farm 
 is cut up into little divisions of a few acres — and the 
 result will not vary much from what I liave stated. 
 They say that every man's house is his castle — one 
 would think every man's farm was his fortification, 
 so cut up is it with these piles of logs, like so many 

entrenchments. Indeed, the best use of a fence that 
 I know, is that at the battle of Bunker Hill; the far- 
 mer-warriors brought two fences together, and filled 
 the interval with new hay, as an impromptu ram- 
 part. But in times of peace they are absolute nuis- 
 ances." 

York County Exhibition. 

From what we recently heard of this exhibition, it 
 appears to have surpassed most others in Pennsylva- 
 nia the present season, not only in the large atten- 
 dance of 12 to 15,000 people, but in the number, va- 
 riety, and excellent quality of the stock, implements 
 and productions, which numbered over fifteen hun- 
 dred entries. 

No intoxicating drink was allowed on the ground, 
 and consequently thero was no drunkeness, broils or 
 confusion. Between one and two hundred horses and 
 mules, many of them very fine animals, were exhibi- 
 ted. In cattle, sheep and swine, the specimens were 
 very good, although not numerous, but including 
 some very fine thorough bred Durhams from the herd 
 of John Evan's, Esq., the president of the society, 
 which were not entered for competition. An Ayr- 
 sh re bull from John Merryman, Esq., of Baltimore, 
 received the first premium. Several of the contribu- 
 tors were from that state. 

Of some other departments the York Advocate 
 says: 

The exhibition of poultry was exceedingly large, 
 and attracted much attention; the coops were nearly 
 all the time surrounded by hundreds of persons. 
 Every breed that has ever been heard of, we believe, 
 was represented. Shanghai, Chittagong, Dorking, 
 Cochin China, Brama Pootra, Chinese Silk, Frizzle, 
 Game, Bantam; also, Geese, Turkeys, Ducks, Pig- 
 eons, Ac, &c. 

The display of Agricultural and Mechanical im- 
 plements was very good, embracihg Mowers, Reap- 
 ers, Cutters, &c., and some new Machines for farm- 
 ing and mechanical purposes. 

Vegetables of all kinds, and in large quantities, 
 and some of monstrous size, occupied a prominent 
 position. Fruits in great abu- dance, fresh from the 
 trees and vines, and cakes and candies, magnificent- 
 ly gotten up, delighted the eye and tempted the taste 
 of every looker on. 

Of the Carpets, (Juilts, Ornamental Needle Work, 
 &c., the display was full and h ghly interesting 
 combining the usefu with the beautiful. 

The display cjf Stoves, Saddlery, Boots, Hats, 
 Flour, Butter, Honey, &c., was large and hindsome- 
 ly arranged. Inasmuch as the report of the Judges 
 will bo published, we refrain from noticing any ani- 
 mal or article particularly. 

On Friday the 7th, The Plmoinfj Maicli ionk place, 
 in a field near to the Fair ground. Three teams 
 were en'ered, but only two appeared on the ground, 
 Mr. Peter, of York township, and Mr. Tliomas Em- 
 niitt, of this Borough. The Plowing was pretty well 
 done considering the ground, .and the cirnnnistnnces 
 attending it. This is yet ratlier a novelty in York 
 county, and all that is necessary, is only the oppor- 
 tunity of a few such trials, to bring the fanners of 
 old York up to their proper m rk in this depart- 
 ment. 

At the close of the plowing match, the people gnth-
