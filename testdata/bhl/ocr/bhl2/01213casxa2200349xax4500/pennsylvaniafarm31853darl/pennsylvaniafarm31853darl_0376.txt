ered around the speaker's stand, when an address 
 was delivered by the Hon. Alex. L. Hayes, of Lan- 
 caster City. Like all that proceeds from his pen, 
 the address was full of good, sound practical sense, 
 full of "words iitly spoken." His manner was 
 pleasinc;, and his words distinct, and his manifest 
 faith in the doctrines he so well promuli^ated, and so 
 aptly illustrated, held that large assembly, for an 
 hour, deeply interested.

Cure for the Potato Rot. 

In a recent conversation with Mr. Joun Barrett, 
 Jr., of Cayuga Bridge, on the subject of the potato 
 disease, he informed us that he had not been troubled 
 with the rot for some years, and that there was an 
 easy remedy for it, whith all might apply with very 
 little trouble or expense. On inquiring for this sim- 
 ple remedy, we expected to have been told that it 
 waa a secret, to be revealed only to those who were 
 willing to contribute a handsome reward to the dis- 
 coverer. But Mr. B. freely gave us his experience, 
 which we as freely impart to our readers, leaving it 
 to them to make the experiment, if they think pro- 
 per. 

Mr. Barrett stated that a few years since, he, as 
 well as most of his neighbors, lost their entire crop 
 of potatoes by the rot — that the next spring he was 
 compelled to go to another town for seed, where he 
 procured a supply for himself and an adjoining 
 neighbor, and where he was told how to prevent the 
 disease. He said ho and his neighbor planted the 
 seed he procured on adjoining fields — the soil and 
 treatment similar — only that Mr. B. applied the rem- 
 edy recommended to him — which consisted in sowing 
 ashes over the field once a week for six weeks, com- 
 mencing shortly after the second hoeing of the crop. 
 He used from two to three bushels of ashes per acre, 
 which is sufficient to give the potato-tops a good 
 dusting. The result was that his field was entirely 
 fre,e from the disease, while the potatoes on the ad- 
 joining field, without this application of ashes, rotted 
 badly. Since theVi, Mr. B., as well as most of his 
 neigliliors, had applied ashes, and had been entirely 
 free from the disease. — Country Gentleman.

How TO Keep SiiotED H.\us. — A writer 
 Farmer's Companion, published at Detroit, 
 that he has for many years preserved his 
 through the summer, in the most perfect condition, 
 by packing them in barrels, with layers of corncobs 
 between them, so that the hams would not come in 
 contact with each other. They should be taken out 
 and rubbed dry once during the summer. The cask 
 should be placed on a bench or trussel, in a cool, 
 dry cellar. 

Fattening Slieep. 

It is sometimes an object to fiitten sheep rapidly 
 in summer, and also to fatten oflf old sheep which 
 cannot be readily fattened on pasture alone. In 
 cither case, good pasture and the feeding of a mode 
 rate quantity of grain daily, will generally effect it 
 very advantageously. One bushel of grain fed to 
 sheep in summer, will make as much fat as three or 
 four fed in winter: hence they may be fattened off 
 most rapidly and with least expense in summer and

Mr, Thome's Imported Stock. 

We much regret to have to record the following 
 mishaps, to some of the high priced stock lately pur- 
 chased in England, while on their voyage to the 
 United States in the Steamer'Herman. The article 
 iafrom the "American Agriculturist." It says. 

The steamer Herman sailed from Southampton on 
 the 12th October, and arrived here on the 29th, with 
 most of Mr. Thome's late purchases of Short-horn 
 cattle in England, and the remainder of his South- 
 down sheep. The cattle put on board were the Duch- 
 ess bull Grand Duke, Duchess 50th, bred by the late 
 Mr. Thomas Bates; Duchess &Sth, Frederica, andLal- 
 lah Rookh, bought of Mr. Townley; Mystery and Au- 
 rora, from Mr. 'Tanqueray; Peri, from Mr. Bolden; 
 and Darling, of Capt. Dilks. Seven prize South-down 
 sheep, purchased of Lord Walsingham, were also put 
 on board, two of which were for Mr. Francis Rotch, 
 of Otsego, N. Y. 

The Hermann had a succession of heavy gales du- 
 ring her whole passage. On the third day out the 
 sheep-house was stove in, and three of these precioua 
 animals were killed. On the eighth d.ay out she en- 
 conntered the most furious storm she ever experien- 
 ced. About midnight the cattle houses were carried 
 away, and the animals strewed in every direction 
 over the deck, where, on account of the severity of 
 the gale, they had to remain till morning. Duchess 
 QSth was killed outright by the breaking of a mast, 
 the others miraculously escaped without material in- 
 jury. Grand Duke did not receive a single scratch. 
 We made a hasty inspection of the above animals 
 after landing. Of course they showed to great dis- 
 advantage, after such a rough voyage, and we shall 
 reserve giving our opinion fully till we can see them 
 under more favorable circumstances. But this much 
 we can say now, that Grand Duke was well named, 
 for a grand bull he really is. His he.ad, eye, and 
 horn are particularly fine; and so far as we can now 
 judge, all his other points may well challenge admira- 
 tion. Ilis color is beautiful, mostly a deep, rich rod, 
 with a fine yellow skin.. Duchess 50(h is too much out 
 of condition to show advantageously, but she seems 
 a superb cow. The Townley, heifers are most extra- 
 ordinary; such fine heads and eyes, and such bris- 
 kets, it strikes us now that we have never met out of 
 Mr. Bates' yard. We shall speak of the other heifers 
 more particulaily hereafter. Suffice it to say that 
 they are well worthy of importation. 

'The sheep are superb, one of the ewes we have ntj 
 recollection of ever having seen surpassed. 

Great credit is due to Mr. Rotch for his selections, 
 and we can well sympathise with him in his care 
 and anxiety in selecting the above choice animals. 
 As we are about going to press, we can say no more 
 at this moment. For some account of the char.acter 
 of tliis stock and the prices paid for it, we would re- 
 fer to number six, page 82, of this journal. Duchess 
 Oilh, having calvrdjust before the steamer sailed, 
 she was left to follow hereafter. 

Mr. Dulany, of Virginia, put on board ten South- 
 down sheep, selected from the flock of Sir. Webb, 
 three of these were also killed when the sheep-house 
 was stove in. Duchess CS(/j was eleven months old, 
 •and cost Mr. Thome 300 guineas — $1500 of our 
 money. It is not the money, however, that Mr. T. 
 regrets at all, but the loss to his country of so high 
 bred and valuable an animal. Those who have not 
 tried it, little know the danger and expense incurred 
 in importin: stock; every good animal arriving hero 
 should therefore be the more highly prised.
