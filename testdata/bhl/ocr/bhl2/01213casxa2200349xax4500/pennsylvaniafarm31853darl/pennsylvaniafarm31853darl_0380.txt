THE STRAWBERRY QDESTION.

king is improved by each succeeding cutting until 
 the third. The coramonyellow willow, [salixvitellina) 
 would no doubt be equally improved by frequent cut- 
 ting. It is certainly tougher than the former under or- 
 dinary circumstances. A variety grown here for five 
 years, probably the S. Forbyana, appears well adap- 
 ted for the purpose, producing slender, branchless 
 shoots ten feet long in a season. Persons desirous of 
 testing different varieties can have cuttings gratui- 
 tously. 

"Almost all the species of willows may be grown 
 or this purpose; but some are greatly preferable to 
 others. The most vigorous growing is unquestiona- 
 bly, S. viminalis; and it is the sort most generally cul- 
 tivated for basket making. It has no disadvantage 
 except that in cold wet seasons and in moist soil it 
 does not always ripen the points of its shoots. S. 
 rubra, S. forbyana, S. decipiens and S. stipularis 
 are excellent species of less vigorous growth than S. 
 Viminalis. The best of these is perhaps S. forby- 
 ana. These we consider as by far the most valuable. 
 The soil for basket willow ought to be deep, well 
 drained, and thoroughly prepared; and the situation 
 ought to be low, level, and naturally moist; and if 
 there is a command of water for irrigation so much 
 the better." Sang observes "there are few soils that 
 will not bear willows; yet some situations are very 
 unfit for them. Dry and exposed grounds, peat, moss 
 and land covered with standing water, or a quagmire 
 are not at all suitable. Hollows, the soil of which 
 is composed of rich, soft, earthy particles, and which 
 can be laid dry, are the most eligible for converting 
 into osiers; and if such can be occasionally soaked 
 with water during the dry months of summer, the 
 situation may be considered perfect. Completely 
 draining the site of a basket willow plantation is the 
 first step towards its formation, and the foundation 
 of its prosperity, and, consequently, of the profit to 
 be derived from it. The drains ought to be open or 
 built on the sides and covered over with flags to pre- 
 vent their being choked up with the roots. In no 
 case should a plantation of willows be attempted but 
 in prepared ground except perhaps, where a few rows 
 may be introduced upon the brink of a river or on 
 the tops of the banks of ditches. Having fixed upon 
 the spot and also having carefully prepared the ground 
 the next step is to procure the plants. These should 
 be of the last years wood, taken from the under end 
 of well-ripened shoots of good size, and they should 
 be in length "f 1 foot. Every vigorous shoot will af- 
 ford two or three plants. Tlie distances at which 
 osiers for baskets ought to be planted are 18 inches 
 between the rows and 12 inches apart in the rows. 
 This distance will not be too thick for at least five 
 or six years; but after that period every alternate 
 plant should be removed. Osier plantations must be 
 carefully hoed .and cleaned every year. When the 
 shoots become too numerous they should be careful- 

ly thinned out, and also cut down, leaving only an 
 eye or two at the bottom of each, until they be dimin- 
 ished to such a number as the stool is capable of sup- 
 porting with vigor throughout the season. A basket 
 maker finds more service from one shoot of 6 or 
 8 feet in length than from four of 3 feet in length and 
 one of the first dimensions will not exhaust the stool 
 or the land so much as four of the others. The proper 
 season for thinning the stools is from the 1st of 
 March to the middle of April. 

The shoots should not be cut till the second au- 
 tumn after planting; for by being allowed to remain 
 uncut such a length of time, the stocks become stron- 
 ger and more able to produce a good crop." 

Should this meet the approbation of editors and read- 
 ers of the Journal it will be followed from the same 
 authorities by The operation of Catting, Peeling, &c. 

In my last communication you have materially en- 
 larged the circumference of my pea stalk. It wants

 Mr. Prince's tetter on the Strawberry Q,uestlou. 

Dear Sir : — When from three plants of McAvoy's 
 Extra Red Strawberry received direct from the rais- 
 er, I produced n whole progeny, having on each plant 
 separate spikes of pistillate and hermaphrodite blos- 
 soms, and I sent you one for verification, an individ- 
 ual came forward and taunted both you and me with 
 gross ignorance in not knowing that it was a charac- 
 teristic of "thai, and a dozen other varieties." When 
 that individual subsequently comes forward in your 
 October number, and labors hard, and quotes "Mr. 
 McAvoy" and "fifty dollars" to prove that that same 
 same strawberry has no such characters ; when such 
 an individual occupies six whole columns solely to 
 make out the inconsistency, &c., of his opponent, 
 truly, as you say, it is time to stop. 

Of what value is all this dogmatic declamation 7 
 What, sir, if you tell a gentleman that you keep 
 your hens beyond the attractions of their male com- 
 panions, as you have already told him a similar thing 
 about osage oranges, figs, and so on, and that they 
 yet lay you eggs in abundance "good enough to eat," 
 — what, I ask, would it signify that he answer you, 
 on the strength of "his long experience," that "it is 
 utterly impossible 1" 

And what if, in like manner, Mr. Barry and oth- 
 ers tell the same gentleman, that they can raise 
 strawberries, "good enough to cat," though by no 
 means perfect, from plants out of the reach of stami- 
 nate influence. What signifies an "utterly impossi- 
 ble" or a "thousand dollars" to the contrary? 

And if, sir, Mr. Forbes in the Salictum Wuburnien- 
 sis, fi'-'uros a specimpn of Salix Cioweaiia, and de- 
 scribes it as having "barren catkins which have the
