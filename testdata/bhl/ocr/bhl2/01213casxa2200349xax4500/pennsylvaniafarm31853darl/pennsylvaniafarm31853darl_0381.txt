remarkable peculiarity ofchanj;inginto_/er<i7eone8," 
 and states that he has vatched the progressive 
 change of the filaments to pistils, — what signifies it 
 that a gentleman from Flushing dares W. D. to offer 
 an instance of the kind? 

■ And when, in Smith's "English Flora," Mr. Bor- 
 rer observes that the same phenomena occurs in Sa- 
 lix Oleifolia, and Mr. Gee the same in S. Cineria, — 
 what effect would it have on the fact if the same gen- 
 tleman were to express his religiously worded senti- 
 ments on our having found "what he considers a 
 "God-send," to help us?" 

And supposing I point to a plant growing in our 
 garden — allied to the strawberry — the Rubus Odora- 
 tus, never producing a berry there, nor, I believe, in 
 any other garden, and then refer to respectable bo- 
 tanical authors for the fact that it formed berries per- 
 fectly in its native mountains when out of the reach 
 of cultivation, — what then if "somebody" or "no- 
 body" did "declare" that "nature's laws were im- 
 mutable," and so the fact, so called, could not be? 

And, again, about this "immutable law," what if 
 we find in the Quarterly Review for 1852, that Sir 
 W. J. Hooker comes forward and says that there is 
 a plant in their collection, named by Smith Ccdeho- 
 gyne Illicifolia, which bears perfect seeds thousands 
 of miles beyond the reach of "staminate influence," 
 what then if even the same gentlemafl from Flush- 
 ing should pronounce the assertion of the fiict to be 
 akin to blasphemy? 

And if, Mr. Editor, any man were to be "dumb" 
 enough to assert that a pistillate flower, once formed 
 or in blossom, could, after that, be made to become a 
 hermaphrodite one, — would there not, ilien, be some 
 analogy between that chaste figure of speech, that 
 "turning of a cow into a bull," and that proposition, 
 — but as no one has made such an assertion, may 
 not analogy, as well as "poetry," become "fool. 
 ery?" 

And, as it seems so fashionable to draw supposed 
 analogies from the animal kingdom, ia it not a fact 
 known to every agricultural stock breeder worthy of 
 the name, that they have it in their power to regu- 
 late the sexes of the animals ,they may raise to a 
 considerable extent, and can only not do so entirely 
 through not knowing enough of this "immutable 
 law,/ about which another seems to know so much ? 
 Have the experiments recorded long ago, in volumes 
 37 and 38 of the Annals de V Agriculture Francaise, 
 as having been made by M. Girou de Buzaricnguez, 
 by which he was enabled to raise as many females 
 in proportion to males in a flock of ewes, as any one 
 might suggest, — have these facts ever been controvert- 
 ed? or rather has not every year more fully confirni- 
 ed the fact, that the "immutable law" which regu- 
 lates these things is comprised of external circum- 
 stances, which may become "perfectly under our 
 control V 

Indeed, sir, were your Journal a medical one I 
 could allude to the discoveries of modern physiolo- 
 gists, by which it would appear that the mere "turn 
 of a straw" prevented Mr. Prince himself from be- 
 ing, perhaps, Mrs. Partington. 

If we want to argue this question scientifically, 
 we must use language accurately, and in that event 
 there is no such thing, aclualhj, as "pistillate" or 
 "hermaphrodite plants." They merely bear pistillate 
 or hermaphrodite flowers, and until the flowers or the 
 rudiments of their separate organs are formed, they 
 are under the laws which regulatj the production or 
 development of either the one or the other. Once 
 formed the sexes are, of course, "immutable." 

And now what becomes of all this talk about "im 
 mutability" and all that? It shows that men talk 
 about these things as if they knew every iota of the 
 process; when, if "wisdom were not extinct,'' with 
 Socrates, they would confess they knew comparative- 
 ly nothing; and it teaches all of us that we have 
 many things to learn, and that there are many thinga 
 hard to be understood, which we shall better come at 
 by a brotherly walking forward hand in hand in the 
 search, than by sitting down in a ditch, and by the 
 strength of our lungs, if not b/ the solidity of our 
 judgment, turn those away from the search after na- 
 ture's truths, who would "follow her through all her 
 secret paths." THOMAS MEEIIAN.
