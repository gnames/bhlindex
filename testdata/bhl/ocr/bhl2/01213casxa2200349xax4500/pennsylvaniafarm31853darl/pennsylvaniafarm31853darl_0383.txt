place it too low. Some were of opinion that it very 
 nearly approached "best," while others considered 
 it as only worthy to be classed "good," accord- 
 ing to the scale of the American Pomological Con- 
 gress. 

The opinion was expressed by a number present, 
 that the cracking ot fruit results from the same cause 
 that produces leaf-blight on the tree; and several in- 
 stances were mentioned where the cracking had com- 
 menced first on the lower parts of the tree, where 
 the leaves had been correspondingly attacked. 

Select Lists. — It was proposed that such gentle- 
 men present as were familiar with the best varie- 
 ties of the pear, should furnish a list of the three 
 best, or such as they would plant the most largely 
 for their own use. The Seckel, Bartleit and Virga- 
 lieu, (or Doyenne,) were selected by P. Barry, of Ro- 
 chester; E. W. Leavenworth, of Syracuse; and T. C. 
 Maxwell, of Geneva. J. J. Thomas, of Macedon, 
 named Flemish Beauty, Seckel, Virgalieu; 3. Battey, 
 of Clinton county, preferred Louise Bonne de Jersey, 
 Flemish Beauty and Witikfield. Dr. Wendell, of 
 Albany, and A. Saul, of Newburgh, would choose 
 Seckel and Bartleit, and would add the Virgalieu, 
 (or Doyenne,) provided it should still continue to do 
 as well as in years past. It thus appears, that of 
 the seven votes given, six were for the Seckel, six 
 for the Virgalieu; five for the Bartlett, two for the 
 Flemish Beauty, and one for the Winkjield. 

The smallness of size has been stated to be an ob- 
 jection to the .SecW, one gentleman remarked that a 
 tree on his grounds, which had been uncultivated, 
 had borne such small fruit as is usually seen; the 
 present year it had been well tilled, {without much 
 manure,) with an increase in the size of the crop, 
 and a three-fold increase in the size of the fruit — 
 many of the specimens being quite as large as an 
 ordinray Virgalieu. The opinion was given by sev- 
 eral that the Seckel had not been allowed a fair 
 chance in ordinary management, and that with high 
 culture its fruit would be much heavier and finer. 

Fire Blight. — E. W. Leavenworth had found the 
 fast growing sorts of the pear, and those stimulated 
 with high manuring, much more liable to blight 
 than those with short, compact wood; and that the 
 disaster usually occurred during the prevalence of 
 the hottest weather; which was in accordance with 
 the observations of several others. 

Second Evening. — Cracking of the Pear. — Some 
 additional remarks were made on this subject by Dr. 
 Ward, of New Jersey, adverse to the opinion that 
 the cracking was caused by the removal of leaves 
 by leaf-blight. On his grounds the \an Jifons Leon 
 le Clerc tree grew with vigor, but the fruit cracked 
 badly — the present season the cracks were nearly 
 large enough to place one's finger within them, yet 
 up to the present time the tree retains its foliage. 
 His Virgalieu trees worked on quince, which, last 
 year had given promise of doing well, had cracked 
 badly the present season — the soil in which ■ they 
 grow is regarded as one of the best lor the pear, 
 and these trees grow vigorously. T. C. Maxwell, of 
 Geneva, had pears of the Virgalieu grown on quince 
 considerably affected, while those growipg on pear 
 stocks were entirely free. 

Proflis of Fruit Culture. — This subject being in- 
 troduced, some statements were made of the large 
 profits derived from the culture of the Lady Apple. 
 W. H. Denning, of Duchess county, had annually 
 sold forty dollars worth of fruit from a single tree, 
 the price varying from eight to twelve dollars per 
 bushel. The soil was gravelly. On soilaioi a differ^ 

ent character the crop had been quite unsuccessful. 
 One gentleman had picked ten barrels from his trees, 
 and found only two barrels fair, the least blemish, 
 entirely spoiling the sale of a fancy fruit. Anotheip 
 gentleman stated that from an orchard in Orang» 
 county, out of five barrels he had not obtained a sin- 
 gle hatful of good specimens. Dr. Ward said that 
 in Ntw Jersey it succeeded well on gravelly loam, 
 which was generally admitted to be its best soil. In- 
 formation was given of the large profits of an orchard! 
 at Darby, near Philadelphia, containing 200 trees, 
 and occupying four acres of land. The average an- 
 nual net profit was §800, or ?200 per acre. The soil 
 of the orchard is constantly cultivated in crops, with 
 the application of bone dust, and it is regarded as 
 one of the neatest and best specimens of orchard cul- 
 ture in the State. 

The high price of this apple depends entirely on 
 the demand for it in cities for fashionable evening 
 parties, which is far greater than the supply. Amer- 
 ican grown Lady Apples also command a very high 
 price for the same object in London. The opinion 
 was however expressed, that as it is not a fruit of 
 the highest character and value, and the fashion may 
 not alwavs continue in its favor, it would be unsafe 
 to plant it largely, or exclusively for market. 

Profts of Pear Culture. — It was stated by a gen- 
 tleman present that Martin Smith of Tarrytown, had 
 sold SGOO worth of Virgalieu pears (at$4 per bushel,) 
 from less than a acre, besides nearly $100 worth of 
 Bartletis. Another instance was mentioned where 
 an old tree, growing in Western New York, had an- 
 nually yielded from $20 to S30 worth of pears, at two 
 and a half dollars per bushel. An acre would ad- 
 mit 100 such trees, and would yield annually from 
 12000 to $3000 in fruit. The tree mentioned received 
 no cultivation. Dr. Ward had obtained from forty 
 trees of the Bartlett, which had been planted only 
 seven years, and which had commenced bearing 
 three years afterwards, an average of half a bushel 
 per tree the present season, and had sold them from 
 four to six dolars per bushel. T. C. Maxwell had 
 trees of the Flemish Beauty seven years planted, and 
 two years old when set out, which had borne two 
 bushels each last year, and over one bushel this. 

Ripening and Marketing Fniit. — All present who 
 had tried the Femish Beauty, had found it, in com- 
 mon with many other sorts,) greatly improved in fla- 
 vor by picking a few days before maturity, and ri- 
 pening within doors. This treatment had also been 
 found necessary by some on account of tlie liability 
 of this pear to be blown off by the wind. P. Barry 
 said that the treatment must be adapted to the 
 peculiarities of the different sorts? — that some pears 
 of a soft, melting character, such for instance, as 
 the Flemish Beauty and Bc/le Lucrative, should 
 be ripened in a cool room, or dry cellar, to prevent 
 the process from being too rapid, and .avoid spee- 
 dy decay. On the other hand, those of a hardier 
 or more gritty nature, needed a much w.irmer 
 temperature. The observation of other corrobor- 
 ated this statement. A dark drawer had been found 
 the best place for a pear to complete its ripening, 
 and to acquire its finest color. Whatever the tem- 
 perature might be, that is best adapted to the manu- 
 ring process, preserving a uniformity, and avoiding 
 changes, was regarded of great importance; and also 
 that too dry atmosphere was unfavorable to the ri- 
 pening of winter pears, cspeciallv, which had to re- 
 main exposed to it a long time, and which, it they 
 once became too dry, never could be made to softea 
 by maturity.
