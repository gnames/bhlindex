[December 

Dr. Ward had found the profits of market pears to 
 depend greatly upon their proper ripening; it not un- 
 frequently happened that a tripplo price was obtain- 
 ed for liandsomely matured Bartletts over those 
 equally well grown, but in a green condition. He 
 had sold them for six dollars per bushel, side 
 by side with those equally as fine in every other re- 
 spect, that would scarcely bring two dollars, and 
 which had not the tempting exterior of full maturity, 
 He had also found selection a matter of considerable 
 importance, and had obtained as much for the finest 
 assorted Bartletts, taken from a large quantity, as he 
 could have obtained for nearly the whole unassorted. 
 The best Barlletts had sold at retail in New York oily 
 at twelve to twenty-five cents each. 

The SscJcel pear, although of such superlative high 
 flavor, was very low-priced in market, although in- 
 stances were mentioned where six to eight dollars per 
 bushel had been obtained for finely grown specimens 
 in the Boston market. 

Winter Pears. — Gentlemen present being called 
 upon to name the best winter pears, P. Barry ex- 
 pressed his preference for the Latcreiice, Winter Nelis, 
 and Easter Buerre. The Laiorence and Winter Nelis 
 would ripen well in boxes in cellars, and the Easter 
 Buerre was unquestionable the best very late keeper, 
 but should always be grown upon the quince. J. 
 Battey, of Clinton county, named two, the Winkfield 
 and Winter Nelis; J. J. Tliomas selected the Wiak- 
 Jield, Lawrence, Winter Nelis and Easter Buerre; Dr. 
 Wendell preferred the Winlcfield, Winter Nelis and 
 Easter Buerre on quince. For exclusive raising on 
 quince, P. Barry would prefer the Winkfield, Glout 
 Morceau, and Easter Buerre. A few gentlemen who 
 were acquainted with the Doyenne f/ris' d' Eiver, re- 
 garded it as giving the highest promise of all the 
 new winter sorts. 

Some discussion occurred in relation to the difii- 
 culty of sending ripened winter pears to city mar- 
 kets in winter from the danger of freezing on the 
 way. J. Battey said that the practice was now common 
 of runing freight cars, warmed artificially, for carry- 
 ing potatoes from Northern New York and Vermont 
 to the Boston market, in the depth of winter; and 
 that no difficulty could occur in the case of winter 
 pears. It was, however, believed by others, that as 
 soon as winter pears should be raised in large quan- 
 tities, establishments would spring up in the cities 
 for purchasing winter pears in autumn, when they 
 could be most safely transportdd to a distance, and 
 for ripening them on a large scale for the market. 
 The ripening process could be done more economical- 
 ly if performed is a wholesale manner, and could 
 doubtless be more perfectly completed, than by any 
 small arrangements for the purpose by the raisers 
 of the fruit. 

Water in Peat. — The importance of placing peat 
 and swamp muck in a position to drain and dry 
 thoroughly after digging, and before drawing, may 
 bo well understood when it is stated that usually 
 from 80 to 90 parts out of a hundred are water, as 
 commonly seen in a moist state, fresh and black 
 from the swamp. 

A Word to Boys. — Stick to your trade, boys, and 
 learn to work if you wish to be truly independent. 
 There is no more pitiable sight than a half mechanic 
 applying for work. He is always at the foot of the 
 hill and labor as he may, unless he becomes perfect 
 in his trade, he can never rise. 

New Corn Crusher. — Thomas Durden, of Mont- 
 gomery, Alabama, has taken measures to secure a 
 patent for a new corn crusher, which is exceedingly 
 well adapted for cracking and crushing corn in the 
 ear, also various other vegetables. The hopper for 
 the reception of the corn is peculiar; it receives the 
 ears of corn by various small openings; they pass 
 down and are first cut by a revolving S shaped knife 
 on a vertical spindle, and after they pass down and 
 are crushed between groves and projections on the 
 revolving spindle, and groves and projections on the 
 inner face of the machine. The grinding parts are 
 of cast iron, the inside of the case being a hollow 
 cone, its bottom where it discharges being the apex, 
 and the grinding spindle or muUer acting with its 
 outer on the inner surface of the case. The appa- 
 ratus is simple and good. — Scientific American

American Wool. — Peter A. Browne, of Phila- 
 delphia, in a communication to the Richmond (Va.) 
 Whig, asserts that he can show that "as fine a fleece 
 can be procured in the United States as in any por- 
 tion of the world." He says that he has in his pos- 
 session wool grown in Allegheny county, Penna., 
 by Wm. Hall, which measures from 1-218(5 to 1-2500 
 part of an inch, while the finest wool in tlie collec- 
 tion sent to him by the king of Prussia, and the finest 
 among the specimens sent to him by the king of Sax- 
 ony, measures 1-2186. Mr. Browne denies the cor- 
 rectness of the decision on the subject at the Lon- 
 don Crystal Palace Exhibition, and produces facts 
 to show that the jury on wool did injustice to the 
 specimens of American wool exhibited.

Improvement in Grist Mills. — The Worcester 
 Spy speaks of improvement in the manner of peck- 
 ing mill-stones by which their capacity for grinding 
 can be doubled. The editor of the Spy saw it ap- 
 plied to a mill in Worcester, and the result of its 
 application was that a bushel of Northern corn was 
 ground in a minute and a half — and that an old 
 fashioned mill, with a single run of stones, with 
 the improvement, will grind forty-six bushels an 
 hour. 

Tu Measure an Acre. 

Land, 30J square yards make one sq, rod ; 40 sq. 
 rods make one sq. rood ; 4 sq. rood, one acre ; 640 
 acres one square mile ; 4,840 sq. yds. or IGO rods 
 made one acre. 

In measuring an acre by yards, the usual prac- 
 is to trace off 70 yards in length, and 70 yards in 
 width ; this in a rough way, may be considered near 
 enough for practical purposes, but as 70 yards either 
 way make 4,900 sq. yds. it exceeds one acre by 60 
 yards. The determine an accurate acre it may be 
 measured 70 yards in length, by C9 1-7 yards in 
 width. The same result may be arrived at by mea- 
 suring 220 feet in length, and 198 feet in width, or 
 by measuring 73 1-3 yards in length, by OG yards in 
 breadth. — Amer. Farmer. 

LiHE Duster. — An English orchardist, whose or* 
 hard occupies 50 acres, protects his trees from cat- 
 erpillars and other insects by shaking over the young 
 foliage quick limo pulverised and sifted through a 
 fine sieve. He puts the lime into a tin conical can- 
 ister, perforated at one end with a long handle. The 
 time for using it is in the dew of the morning, or 
 whenever the leaves are damp. He has found it 
 very effectual.
