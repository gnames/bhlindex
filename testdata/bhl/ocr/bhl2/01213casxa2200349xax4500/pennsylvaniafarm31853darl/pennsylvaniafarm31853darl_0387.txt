Pontiac. 

The opposite cut represents the Durham Bull, Pon- 
 tiac, (sire and dam imported,) recently the property 
 of Seth A. Bushnell, of Hartford, Trumbull county, 
 Ohio, and sold by him at the late Pennsylvania State 
 Fair, at Pittsburgh, to Gen. Wm. Larimer, of that 
 city. 

Pontiac is six years old, a light roan color, medium 
 size, compact and symmetrical form; has a remarka- 
 bly prominent and sparkling eye, combined with a 
 quietness and docility of temper, which insure fine 
 feeding properties. Where known, the early maturi- 
 ty of his stock with other excellencies cause them to 
 be popular and eagerly sought alter. 

Philadelphia Society for Promoiiiig Agriculture, 

The exhibition of the above society, held at the 
 Rising Sun, near Philadelphia, was considered in 
 most respects fully equal to former years, although 
 from the absence of two or three principal contribu. 
 tors in neat cattle, there was a falling off in this de- 
 partment. In a fine display of horses, also sheep, 
 swine, poultry, agricultural implements and produce, 
 the exhibition maintained its previous prominent 
 character. The ploughing match was postponed on 
 account of unfavorable weather, and two days were 
 oeeupied by the exhibition, instead of three as here- 
 tofore. 

An address was delivered by Thomas II. Burrowes 
 of Lancaster, which is very highly commended by 
 those who heard it.

 Hessian Fly. 

Messrs. Editors: — The Hessian fly is perhaps, 
 more destructive to the wheat crop of this country 
 than all other insects and vermin, and, indeed seems 
 most to be dreaded. That the wheat crop of our 
 country should some seasons be cut short even mil- 
 lions of bushels is, much to be lamented, while no 
 remedy we believe, as yet of general practicability 
 has been discovery to stay the ravages of this insect. 

If however the knowledge that is in possesion of 
 some individuals in relation to it, were generally 
 known to farmers, it is possible, the ravages of this 
 destructive little agent, might be prevented in some 
 measure at least. The injury to the plant by it, 
 seems to be done entirely while the insect is in its 
 larva or egg state; absorbing in some way as its 
 nourishment the juices of the growing stalk. After 
 it has arrived at a certain stage (as we are informed,) 
 it escapes from its outer skin or shell a winged in- 
 sect, and rises in the air. And in this transformed 
 state, (we are told) it propagates its species by de- 
 positing its eggs in the young \vlieat plants in the 
 fall of the year. We have taken the pains to put 

some roots and stalks in which were a deposit of 
 these eggs into a bottle, for the purpose of getting a 
 sight of the creature in its winged state but did not 
 succeed. There are but few persons, we believe who 
 know it in its winged form; we have not met with 
 one who could recognize or point it out to us distinct- 
 ly among the many winged tribes that are seen sport- 
 ing in the air. Will you or some of your correspon- 
 dents be so kind as to give through the columns of 
 the Farm Journal a description of it, which with a 
 cut of the same, would enable any one to recognize 
 it with a little pains. 

J. H. ALEXANDER. 
 In reply to our correspondent above, we shall give, 
 in our January number, engravings of the winged 
 Hessian Fly, so that he or any one can easily iden- 
 tify it, together with its history and habits. His 
 request was not received in time for present number.

Nepaul Barley. 

Editors of Farm Journal. — Sirs: — Enclosed I 
 send you a small sample of a new species of Barley. 
 It was sent to a Gentleman of Georgia during the 
 winter of 1850-'51, from the Nepaul Mount.iins of 
 Ilindostan, and is believed to be the first of its kind 
 ever seen in the United States. The grain has 
 very much the appearance of the "Emur" or wheat 
 barley only smaller, but that variety like all oth- 
 ers, has beards or awns, while this is entirely 
 beardless, or what is termed bald. The plant is re 
 markably vigorous, tillers well, and from a single 
 years trial, I judge it will succeed in this latitude 
 quite as well as any other kind of spring barley. When 
 in bloom, it looks beautiful in contrast with other 
 grain, the whole patch being covered with its bright 
 yellow infloresence. 

As I have rented my farm, I am under the neecs 
 sity of curtailing my propensity of experimenting 
 with new grains, grasses, &c. I am therefore willing 
 to distribute this grain (about 1 quart,) in small 
 parcels to "patrons of the Farm Journal" for a more 
 extended trial. 

Those who wish samples of it will please advise 
 me by mail, enclosing a postage stamp to cover ex- 
 penses of mailing. A report of their success or 
 otherwise through the pages of the "Farm Journal" 
 is all the recompense I desire, except I might add, 
 a like liberal distribution of similar favors, by those 
 who may be in possession of any new or rare seeds, 
 fruits, <fec., &c. Very respecfully,
