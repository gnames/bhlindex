its have not been properly appreciated. And al- 
 tliough admitted to be a native of Pennsylania, tliere 
 is no published record of its history, nor any infor- 
 mation given in any work in rejjard to the particular 
 locality of its origin. The Philadelphia Market has 
 long been abundantly supplied with it, under the 
 names of Sjiice and Spice Butter. Not, however, un- 
 til recently, have we been able to trace its his oi-y; 
 for which we are chiefly indebted to Mr. Mahlon 
 Moon, of Morrisville, Bucks county. This varictj' 
 originated, about seventy years ago, with Aaron 
 Feastcr, of Northampton township, Bucks county. 
 Having sprung up on a piece of ground used as a 
 meadow, Mr. Fcaster designated it the Meadow Pear; 
 subsequently it was named iJic Feasier. The original 
 tree is still standing, and continues, at the age of 
 three-score years and ten, to bear most abundant- 
 ly. Some seasons, it has yielded five barrels of fruit, 
 which was sold for forty dollars. Although rather 
 coarse in texture, and somewhat gritty at the core, 
 yet when properly house-ripened, it is rich, mebing, 
 delicious, and in quality, "veri/ good." Judging from 
 the form and flavor, its parents are probably the 
 Seckel and the Bergamot. October is its period of 
 maturity. 

2. T/ie Hepler — grown by Mr. Ilepler, of Reading. 
 A nat,ve winter Apple described in the ad interim 
 Report for April last. — The present specimens differ 
 from those sent us last spring, in being larger, two 
 and three-fourths inches, by three and one-fourth; in 
 possessing a short stem, three-eighths ong, by one- 
 eighth thick, and in having a marbled redcheek with 
 usually one or more white marks, as if the rod col- 
 oring matter had been entirely rubbed off. Specimens 
 not sufficiently mature for testing. 

3. The Fornwalder, Fallenu-alder, Fallmrafer. — 
 We have been informed by some of the old inhabi- 
 tants of Reading, that this variety originated with 
 a Mr. Fornwald, of that place; hence the name Forn- 
 walder. In our notice of it in the March ad interim 
 Report, we considered if of "ijood" qualiti/. The 
 specimens received this season, being remarkably 
 fine, and measuring more than a foot in circumfer- 
 ence, have give us a still more favorable opinion of 
 it. Indeed the uniformly large size, unblemished 
 appearance and fair quality of the Fornwalder ren- 
 der it worthy of being more widely cultivated. 

4. The Ramho. — I'hiladelphia was plentifully sup- 
 plied, some years ago, with this apple, from the 
 neighboring State of New Jersey. Now it has al- 
 most entirely disappeared from our market. The 
 specimens, however, sent by Mr. Kessler, clearly in- 
 dicate that it still flourishes in the vicinity of Read- 
 ing. 

5. The Keim — grown on the premises of Mrs. 'Kess- 
 ler, This native apple, of Berks county, we no- 
 ticed in our February and March "ad interim" 
 Reports. The present specimens are larger and fair- 
 er than those previously received, but have not yet 
 reached their period of maturity.

7. Unknown — grown near Dixon, Illinois. Size, 
 very large, three and one-quarter inches long by 
 four broad; form, roundish, obscurely conical, some- 
 what compressed at the sides; color, yellowish green, 
 with a faint blush; stem, short, stout, half-inch long, 
 by one-sixth thick, inserted in a wide, obtuse cavity; 
 calyx, open, set in a deep, rather narrow basin, 
 slightly plaited. Not mature. 

8. Unknown — grown near Dixon, Illinois. Size, 
 very largo, three inches long, by three and seven- 

eighths broad; form, oblate; color, brownish red, 
 mottled with greyish russet, and interspersed with 
 numerous large grey dots with a russet point in the 
 centre of each, yellowish green about the crown; 
 stem, sliort, stout, fleshy, live-eighths of an inch long, 
 and three-quarters thick, inserted in a wide, shallow, 
 russetted cavitj-, with a prominence on one side; ca- 
 lyx, large, closed, set in a wide, rather shallow basin. 
 Not mature. 

9. Unknown — grown near Dixon, Illinois. Size, 
 largo, two and scven-sixteen'ths inches long, by tiirce 
 and three-sixteenths broad; fcjrm, loundish oblate, 
 somewhat angular; color, lieautifully striped with 
 carmine on a yellowish white ground, stem, short, 
 three-eighths of an inch long and one-tenth tliick, 
 set in a deep, modcately open caxity; calyx, closed, 
 set in a narrow, superficial basin. Not mature. 

10. Unknown — grown near Dixon, Illinois. Size, 
 largo, three inches long, l)y three and one-half broad; 
 form, oblong truncate; clor, brown, on a greenish 
 yellow ground, with a numlier of grey dots; stem, 
 half-inch long and one-eighth thick, inserted in a 
 rather deep cavity; calyx, medium, set in a deep, 
 wide, furrowed basin. Not mature. 

11. Unknown — grown near Dixon, Illinois. Size, 
 large, two and seven-eighths inches long, by three 
 and three-eighths broad; form, roundish-conical; 
 color, striped and mottled with red, on a greenish 
 yellow ground; stem, short and slender, one-halt' inch 
 "long and one-eleventh thick, inserted in a deep, nar- 
 row cavity; calyx, small, partially reflexed, set in a 
 narrow, moderately deep, plaited basin. If the 
 quality of tliis and the four preceding apples corres- 
 ponds with the size and fine appearance of their ex- 
 terior, they should be widely disseminated. Per- 
 haps our corresponding member. Dr. Kennicott, or 
 some of the Pomologists of Chicago, whence the 
 trees were, obtained can inform us what the varieties 
 are. 

12. Labeled Limber Ttcig — a small, pleasant, 
 greenish yellow apple from Idinois, not true to 
 name. 

13. and 14, also from Illinois, are small and not 
 prepossessing in appearance. 

15. Vandirer — grown by Mrs. Kessler, of Read- 
 ing. Specimens very fine. This variety is chiefly 
 prized for its culinary properties. In regard to the 
 orthography of its name, we would remark, that in 
 Delaware, where it originated, there is no family 
 with the cognomen Vandervere, but there are many 
 of the inhabitants of Swedish descent, in that State, 
 who write their names Vandiver. 

10, 17, IS, 10 and 20— were grown by David L. 
 Wenrich, of Reading. Most of these ara sweet ap- 
 ples, of pleasant flavor. But their small size, unac- 
 companied by an attractive exterior, impairs their 
 value.
