reach the sum of .f 15,000. It is contemplated by the 
 officers of the Society, to use this sum for the purpose 
 of establishing an Agricultural school, and applica- 
 tion will be made to the Legislature for an act of in- 
 corporation for the purpose. It is believed by the 
 officers of the Society, that an institution of this kind, 
 established upon a proper basis, could be sustained 
 by the resources of the Society.

They add: 

Competitors for premiums for the above agricultu- 
 ral productions, must produce a full statement of the 
 mpde of cultivation, and accompany the same 
 with the certificates of two respectable men as to 
 the product and measurement of the ground, and 
 also exhibit a sample of each crop at the Annual 
 Meeting in Harrisburg, on the 3d Tuesday of Jan- 
 uary ncxt,_ when these premiums will be awarded. 

The entire crop produced on the ground surveyed 
 must be measured in the bushel, and no premium 
 will be awarded by the committee where a part of 
 the crop is measured and the balance of one, or five 
 acres, is estimated thereby. That is where a person 
 contends for the best five acres, the whole crop grown 
 on the five acres must be measured, and certified to, 
 &c. 

Samples of crops, with certificates of product and 
 measurement of ground, should be sent to David 
 Mumma, jr., at Harrisburg, before the first of Janu- 
 ary nest, in order that the judges may have time to 
 examine them before the Annual Meeting of the So- 
 ciety, when the premiums will he awarded. Grain 
 and Root crops, samples should not be less than half 
 a bushel; Seeds, not less than a pound; Tobacco, not 
 less than five pounds. 

Trying to farm without capital, is like trying to 
 run a locomotive without fuel. Money and wood 
 both must be consumed, if they are to move the ma- 
 chine of the farm or of the rail. 

The true order of learning should be, first, what is 
 necessary; second, what is useful; and third, what is 
 ornamental. To reverse this arrangement, is like 
 beginning to build at the top of the edifice.

The nerve which never relaxes, the eye which 
 never blanches, the thought which never wanders — 
 these are the masters of victory. 

For the Farm Journal. 
 Sbaughaiaua. 

In this great progressive age. 

New tangled notions are the rage; 

A mania's touched each branch of science, 

Set law and rea=on at defiance. 

Even farming, old and honor'd art, 

Has seen its palmiest days depart; 

The old routine no more is known. 

The farmer now a chemist's grown. 

And obstruse science, dark and mazy. 

Has turned his head and set him crazy. 

He speculates in improved stock, 

AVhile 'ere his purse will bear the shook; 

And when at last he's lost his all. 

The cause he sees of his downfall. 

To stay him in his mad career, 

Aud whisper caution in his ear, 

I'll tell how I was hanknqii made. 

By entering in the Shangliai trade. 

Wife Betsy, if I may believe her. 

At a show had caught ybaJ^yet-cr, 

And soon, greatly to my surprise. 

Became quite rabid on Shaughais; 

And fearful lest she'd scold and pout, 

I straightway went to pick some out. 

The dealer showed us every kind. 

And wife could scarce make up her mind, 

'Twixt buff Shanghais and some still finer, 

He called the Royal Cochin China : 

And should of these, neither suit her, 

He had a kind called Brahma Pootra. 

She chose, and I, with many sighs, 

Paid fifty dollars for Shanghais. 

Months have elapsed, and mark the change, 

Beyond mv fancy's wildest range. 

For now 'twould seem, misfortunes rife 

Conspire to render wretched my life. 

The other day wife Betsy said. 

We would a pair of fowls behead; 

She served them up, they were so tough. 

Of Shanghais I soon had enough, 

And wife's false teeth, that a week before 

Had cost me sixty dollars or more, 

She broke, and by this mishap cruel, 

Poor Betsy had to live on gruel: 

While I myself, in trying to chew 

A piece, nearly broke my jaw in two. 

Through sleepless hours, all night long. 

Is heard their thundering Chinese gong, 

Their constant crowing drives me mad, 

And then their gluttony is as bad; 

They've eat us out of house and hall, 

(Bad as this is it is not all,) 

My pigs are starving in their sties. 

For want of meal, no cakes or pies 

For months we've had, for not an egg 

AVe get unless we buy or beg. 

My suffering cows with look forlorn, 

'Low for their 'customed food of corn; 

And Dobbin and his patient mate. 

No longer show their wonted gait : 

Their ribs plain seen, and staring coats, 

Attest the want of corn and oats. 

The corn crib's empty, grain bins clean, 

The Shanghais have been there I ween; 

My credit's gone, my debts unpaid, 

My friends avoid me half afraid. 

And to conclude my mournful tale, 

My farm is up at "sheriff's sale."
