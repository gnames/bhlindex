WEST CHESTER, JANUARY, 1854. 

NUMBER 1. 

OUB NEW VOLUME. 

With the present number commences the fourth vol- 
 ume of the Pennsylvania Farm Journal, and which we 
 hope to make sviperior to any of its predecessors in ty- 
 pographical execution, value of matter and general va- 
 riety. We are encouraged by the numerous friends and 
 early patrons of the .Journal in the belief, that it now 
 ranks well compared with other agricultural periodicals; 
 that it is especially adapted to the State in which it 
 chiefly circulates; and that the position it has attained in 
 so comparatively short a period as three years, is proof 
 that it has been found equal to the occasion, which 
 seemed to require at least one paper in Pennsylvania de- 
 voted to the interests of agricultural and horticultural 
 improvement in their various departments. 

So far as a steady increase of our subscription list 
 may be considered evidence, our efforts to make the 
 Pennsylvania Farm Journal what it ought to be, have 
 been appreciated, and whatever doubts may have been 
 entertained about the success of the enterprise at the 
 start, it has noyr passed that period of uncertainty, and 
 may be considered firmly established on a permanent 
 basis. For the future we look forward with confidence, 
 not only to a continuance of former support, but to in- 
 creased exertions on the part of our friends, favorably 
 located in different parts of the State, to establish clubs 
 and extend its circulation. Our terms, considering the 
 amount and value of the matter it contains, are as low 
 as any other similar paper, and we do not think they can 
 faii-ly be objected to by any one. The information in a 
 single number has been, we are assured, the means of 
 saving a large amount of money to individual farmers, 
 and it is entirely impossible but that it will in future, to 
 the intelligent reader, be worth many times more than 
 the small amount of subscription. 

Agricultural periodicals have become pnsitivcl}' neces- 
 sary to the skilful farmer, who expects to keep up with 
 the improvements and progress of the times. There is 
 no branch of rural economy, whether it is the raising of 
 Stock and the adaptation of particular breeds to certain 
 districts, improvements in agricultural implements and 
 machinery, new modes of tillage, introduction of new 
 articles of culture, valuable seeds, planting and manage- 
 ment of orchards, the ravages of insects, &c., &c., but 
 in which there is j-et much to learn, and on which the 
 practical farmer may dcy-ive valuable instruction from 
 agricultural papers. On all these, and other kindred 
 subjects, we hope to ke?p the readers of the Farm Jour- 

nal fully posted up, and to furnish such illustrations and 
 engravings in each number as m.ay be found desirable. 
 Our Journal has heretofore been better supplied with 
 descriptive engravings than most others. This siaperior- 
 ity we shall endeavor to maintain. We are also prom- 
 ised for the future valuable aid from several able con- 
 tributors and practical farmers in Pennsylvania, which 
 will greatly add to the value of the work. To those 
 who have heretofore assisted us in this way, we are 
 much obliged, and hope for a continuance of their fa- 
 vors; and to practical farmers generally, who are more 
 used to the plough than the pen, we would say give us 
 any facts or details relating to your own farm manage- 
 ment, or that of your neighborhood, without reserve or 
 hesitation. The fads ai-e just what we want. We do 
 not care that they should be just dressed in nice language 
 for the printer. We can do that if necessary. What 
 we want are plain facts and practical experiments, and 
 upon these the real value of any Farm Journal must 
 very much depend. We have from the very first been 
 desirous to give ours a practical character, and make it 
 acceptable to the working farmer, who farms for a live- 
 lihood. 

Our coming volume will continue in each number, the 
 valuable list of new patents relating to agriculture, reli- 
 able accounts posted up to the latest period before going 
 to press of our own and foreign markets, prospects of 
 crops, prices of grain and cattle at the principal busi- - 
 ness seaports, the valuable monthly reports of the 
 Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, and also such stan-- 
 dard articles from our foreign exchanges in Europe, as â€¢ 
 are adapted to our own practice, and are worth preser- 
 ving for future references. 

We have also been fortunate in obtaining the regular 
 correspondence of one of our Chester county farmers, 
 who is now in Europe with a view to make considerable 
 stay, and perfect himself in chemistry applied to agri- 
 culture under some of her celebrated teachers. His 
 first letter appears in present number, dated Leipsic. 
 His observations there will add much to the interest of 
 our coming volume. 

In conclusion, while- we intend to do all in our power 
 to make the Farm Jom-nal acceptable to our subscribers 
 all over the State, we ti-uet they will also lend us a help- 
 ing hand, not only ia contributing articles occasionally 
 for its pages, but also aid ns in extending its circulation 
 and getting up clubs in their respective neighborhodds. 

We shall send the present number with this object to 
 some who have not heretofore been reciving it.
