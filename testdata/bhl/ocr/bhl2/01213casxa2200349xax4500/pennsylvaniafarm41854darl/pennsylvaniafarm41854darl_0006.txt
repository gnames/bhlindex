THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[January 

Work for the Month. 

Farm: — Stock I'equii-es particular attention. Give 
 sufficient shelter, some variety in their food, free and 
 convenient access to water, and have a lump of rock salt 
 in the yard for them to go to, which is much better and 
 more economical than salting at stated times. Cut up 
 straw, hay and corn fodder ; the saving by tliis will 
 more than pay for a machine, in one winter. Keep cows 
 at night in wai-m, well ventilated stables, well furnished 
 with litter, and turn out in fine weather. Use the cattle 
 card daily, particularly on heifers and young stock; feed 
 once a day, at least, with roots, cabbage, &c., and a lit- 
 tle meal ; milk before feeding, to avoid taste of turnips, 
 &c., in milk and butter; accustom calves to the halter, 
 by being regularly tied up at nights in stalls ; give extra 
 food to Avorking oxen; have corn ground in cob for feed- 
 ing ; attend to manure in yard as directed last month ; 
 protect all tools and vehicles from weather ; hard lime, 
 ashes, and such other fertilizers as may be wanted the 
 coming season. Sheej) should have good shedding, and 
 be fed, besides good hay, with oats daily, and also roots, 
 sufficient to keep them in good thriving condition. — 
 There is no gain at lambing time from sheep poorly kept 
 through the winter ; they should always have access to 
 water and salt at their pleasure. At leisure times, and 
 iu wet weather, make plain gates to substitute for bars 
 all over the farm ; there is great economy in this. Give 
 attention to poultry. Let theui have a warm house to 
 go to, with some refuse meat, grain, sand and ashes al- 
 ways at hand. A few well kept will pay better than a 
 large number running at large and \incared for. 

Fruit Orchard: — But little is to be said, farther than 
 directions for last month, under this head. Remove all 
 long grass and rubbish from trees, which attract mice. 
 Bank up earth as before recommended. Arrange plan 
 of orchard and fruit garden for spring planting ; select 
 at this leisure season, from fruit books and other sources, 
 what varieties will probably be wanted ; provide fencing 
 materials, and have them ready for early use ; cut down 
 worn-out and decayed apple trees ; provide stakes and 
 tallies for trees ; plant the orchard on paper in winter, 
 at leisure, and thus expedite business in spring ; spread 
 lime over old orchards ; moderate pruning may be at- 
 tended to in this month ; dig in Guano or short manure, 
 to promote vigorous growth. 

Vegetable Garden: — Attend to directions of last 
 month ; keep a close watch on frames, so as not to force 
 into growth or injure by exposure ; attend to composts, 
 and procure materials for forcing beds in spring ; repair 
 sash, and make mats of straw for covering in cold nights; 
 provide a full supply of bean poles, pea sticks, &c.; pro- 
 ,care what gardening tools may be wanted, and antici- 
 ]pate the working season. 

Flower Garden: — If the hints given out the previous 
 -month have been attended to, there will be little to do 
 this month in the flower garden. Protection should be 
 ; given at once to all tender roses and shrubs requiring it. 
 Plants in windows should be carefully watched, and avoid 
 too frequent watering. A good watering when neces- 
 sary, is mucda better than constant wetting. That pest 
 the Green Fly, can be kept under by occasionally syring- 
 ing or immersing in tobacco water, made by steeping to- 
 tbacco stems in water for twenty-four hours. 

Orange and Lemon trees in cellar, should have fresh 
 air admitted when weather is open ; water only when 
 dry. Plants in cold frame should have air every fine 
 day. They are very liable to be injured by excess of 
 moisture. 

CULTURE OF HOLLYHOCKS. 

The various tinted single Hollyhock and enormous 
 Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) so frequently seen about 
 the farmer's domicile, particularly in places remote from 
 the influence of Horticultural Societies, are always sug- 
 gestive to us of the early settlement of the country, and 
 the existence, though in an unimproved and uncultivated 
 form, of a latent spark of love for flowers, which, we 
 believe, to be natural more or less with every one. 

They are often the first results of the commencement 
 by the emigrant's wife of a flower garden, and are also 
 often seen, as is an occasional log cabin in the older set- 
 tlements. Growing without care or attention, and with- 
 out infringing on pressing and necessary duties, their 
 gaudy colors and gaunt, giant forms are reared, making 
 the first inroad upon, and contrast with, rough imculti- 
 vated nature around them, seeming like the vanguards 
 of civilization. Are there any other flowers so miiver- 
 sally cultivated at farm houses ? We think not, and 
 rude and homely as they may seem to more refined and 
 cultivated tastes, we always view them with interest, as 
 the precursors of something better, and rejoice to see 
 them. All the happy moral influences of flowers, the 
 attractions of home, and sympathetic love of nature in 
 any form, which is found iu children especially, may be, 
 and no doubt are, often associated to some extent with 
 the despised Hollyhock. 

Like the lilac bush, its familiar face may recall the 
 recollection of many a happy day around the old home- 
 stead cottage, and its lively image suggest wholesome 
 thoughts and feelings in many a lonely hour. We 
 would not decry even the Hollyhock. It has its place 
 and its time, where it is appropriate, and becoming and 
 useful, which is not in a city garden to be shamed of 
 its rusticity by the rich and gorgeous specimens which 
 wealth has collected from abroad, but rather as an ac- 
 companiment of the sequestered cabin and secluded 
 country school and farm house. There let it remain. 
 Our object in commencing this article was, however, to 
 speak of the improved or double Hollyhock, which has 
 become so fashionable of late in England, and which 
 bids fair to rival the dahlia. Heavy premiums are 
 awarded to it at the Horticultural Exhibitions, and 
 there is a lively competition among hollyhock growers. 
 AV. Chater has been the most successful grower and ex- 
 hibitor thus far, and has sold some of his choice seed- 
 lings at several guineas each. He has one acre entirely 
 devoted to them, making a rich and splendid display. 
 Their bloom generally precedes the dahlia, thus keeping 
 up an agreeable succession. Many of the improved 
 Hollyhocks have very double flowers, entirely concealing 
 the centre, semi-spherical in shape with closely arranged 
 petals, and an even, regular outside edge, and are also 
 quite dwarf in habit. Forming a regular, tapering 
 spike of flowers, surrounding the stem and concealing 
 almost entirely the leaves, they arc both unique and 
 beautiful, and embrace nearly every shade of color
