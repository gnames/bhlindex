est hills, and is admitted by all to make the strongest and 
 best feeding pasture : stock prefer it to anything else. 
 On what are called our grazing farms, the larger part is 
 retained in this kind of grass, for periods of from 10 to 
 30 years, without I'equiring to be ploughed, and rather 
 improving in value yearly. The sod becomes so firm, 
 stiff and compact that every thing else is smothered out, 
 and the green grass, and white clover sometimes with it, 
 have entire possession. Once in a few years these fields 
 receive a top dressing of lime, about 50 bushels to the 
 acre, and an occasional dressing of plaster in the winter 
 or spring, which is all they require, and which seems to 
 give them renewed luxuriance. Red Clover and Timothy 
 usually sown with the wheat, and mowed for two or three 
 years, are then pretty much smothered out by this spon- 
 taneous growth of the invaluable Green Grass. 

3d. Our farmers generally avoid stocking too heavy, by 
 which cattle have sufficient food even in mifavorably dry 
 seasons, and in ordinary ones have a great abundance. 
 We could show fields in this vicinity, in the middle of 
 winter, where there often appears to be enough grass 
 about in clumps to keep considerable stock in thriving 
 condition, and indeed it is often found, that where a por- 
 tion are kept out all winter on these old pastures, they are 
 in better condition in the spring, than those which have 
 been confined to the barn yard, exclusively on dry fodder 
 and hay. 

Improved breeds of Cattle and Sheep attain in Chester 
 county, a size and maturity, which has surprised many 
 from a distance. Here seems to be especially the home 
 of the Short Horns and Southdowns. The latter which 
 from their great hardiness, are especially adapted for 
 thin soils, and scanty pastures, attain on our fertile 
 hills, extraordinary size and fatness. Chester county 
 stock is becoming celebrated all over the country, and 
 within a few months, has been sent from this vicinity, to 
 various other States even as far South as Georgia. 

Experiments in top dressing for Hay. 

W. Clift of Stonington, Ct., has given through the 
 Agricultor an interesting account of his experiments in 
 top dressing for hay. We have reduced the lots experi- 
 mented upon to acres, for convenience and brevity. 

Lot No. 1, was left without dressing as a standard for 
 comparison, and produced 3920 lbs. 

No. 2, received twenty cart loads of cow-stable manure, 
 valued at $12, and produced 4880 lbs. Increase 960 lbs., 
 'Which at the rate of ten dollars per ton is worth $4.80. 
 Net loss per acre $7.20. 

No. 3, was dressed with eigthy poiinds of prepared su- 
 perphosphate of lime, costing $2.00, and yielded 4960 
 lbs. Increase 1040 lbs. worth $5.20. Net gain, $3.20. 

No. 4, had thirty-two bushels of ashes, worth $4. This 
 gave no increase. 

No. 5, was treated with twenty pounds of guano, mix- 
 ed with three bushels of charcoal cinders. Cost, $2. 
 Produce 4000 lbs. Increase 80 lbs. Net loss, $1.60. 

No. 6, had twenty-five pounds of guano mixed in the 
 same way, worth $2.50. Yield, 4720 lbs. Increase 800 
 lbs. Net gain $1.50. 

No. 7, was dressed with superphosphate of lime of home 
 ■manufacture, made from Proff. Way's receipt, value $4. 
 Produce 5280 lbs. Gain 1360 lbs. Net gain $2.80. 

No. 8, received eight bushels of droppings from the 
 hen house, previously mixed with plaster, and charcoal 
 cinders. Value $4. Produce 5440 lbs. Increase 1520 
 Net gain $3.60. 

It will be observed that Mr. Clift makes no estijnate 
 for the value of the manure, beyond the first crop. This 
 must necessarily be considerable, and may in some de- 
 gree vary the result in another season. It however adds 
 to the intrinsic value of manure to the farmer. The im- 
 mediate gain per acre, it will be seen, was, in most in- 
 stances, over fifty per cent on the outlay. 

Many of our readers have, doubtless tried experiments 
 similar to the above. Will they not give us the result of 
 their experience? 

Extraordinary Product of Butter from an Alderney Cow. 

Thos. Motley, jr., gives the following statement of the 
 amount of butter made by his imported Jersey Cow, 
 "Flora," in a recent number of the Boston Cultivator. 

She has had no grain or meal, or any food whatever 
 besides grass, with this exception: in August, September 
 and part of October I gave her, as I gave all my other 
 cows, a feed of corn stalks morning and evening, as my 
 pastures were almost dried up. I truly believe that with 
 a good rich pasture, she would have done better without 
 the corn fodder, than in my pasture with corn fodder. I 
 have now taken her from pasture, and am feeding with 
 hay and ruta bagas, and will give you a statement some- 
 time hence of what she makes. We commenced saving 
 the milk for cream May 10th — first churning May 18th; 
 but this was only seven days milk.

To raise Chestnuts. 

To the prevailing disposition to neglect the good with- 
 in our reach, and long for something more difficult to at- 
 tain, must we attribute the neglect to cultivate and im- 
 prove the American Chestnut. As a shade tree merely, it 
 is hardly surpassed for the lawn when it has I'oom, grow- 
 ing to a magnificent size, with large umbrageous branches 
 and beautiful tassels. It also grows rapidly, and is ex- 
 cellent for grouping. 

It is however of the nuts chiefly we intended to speak, 
 and then quote, as appropriate, the following excellent 
 article from the Iowa Farmer. Boiled chestnuts, what- 
 ever may be said about the luxury of cracking almonds 
 and shellbarks around the fire place of a winter's even- 
 ing, surpasses, in our opinion, them and all other nuts. 
 By selecting large and fine specimens for seed, they can 
 no doubt be improved in size and quality. French and
