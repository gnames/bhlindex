Spanisli Chestnuts sell in Pkiladelpliia market, at from 
 25 to 50 cents "^ quart, but are not so sweet and palata- 
 ble to our taste as our native variety. They are all how- 
 ever well worthy of more extensive cultivation. The 
 Chestnut tree lives to a great age. 

The Tortmouth Chestnut mentioned by Loudon, is prob- 
 ably more than eight hundred years old, having been 
 growing before the conquest in 1066. 

There is no difficulty in vaisiug chestnuts from the seed, 
 if proper precautious are taken in gathering, preserving and 
 planting the seed. The chestnuts which are designed for 
 planting should be gathered as soon as thoy are fully ripe, 
 and the largest and plumpest should be selected. They 
 should be immediately placed in mould or sifted earth and 
 put away in the cellar, or buried in the ground, out of the 
 way of the frost, rats and children. Be sure to use earth 
 enough about them to prevent their heating. When the 
 spring opens, prepare a piece of ground, by pulverizing and 
 plowing it deeply, and plant the seed in rows three feet apart 
 in the rows. They should not be covered deep, else they 
 will rot in the ground. Half an inch of covering will an- 
 swer every purpose. If you wish them to grow straight 
 and thriftily, they must be well hoed after planting. Thoy 
 may remain in the nursery rows two or three years, but if 
 more than two years the tap root should be cut away with a 
 sharp spade. They will then throw out side-roots, and will 
 endure transplanting the next year all the better. There is 
 no difficulty in transplanting chestnuts, if the tap root has 
 been cut off a year or two before. We transplanted six trees 
 last spring from a nursery in this neighborhood, and thoy 
 have since made an average growth of three feet. 

Many people complain that their chestnuts are stunted in 
 their growth, or that they grow crooked. This may be rem- 
 edied by cutting them down even with the ground so soon 
 as they have become stout enough. They will then throw 
 up a nice, straight shoot, that will grow very rapidly, and 
 very little if any time is lost in making a largo and healthy 
 tree. The whole nourishnont from the roots, however, must 
 be thrown into the one shoot, by cutting or rubbing all 
 others off. 

Profits and Pleasures of Agriculture. 

Extracts from David Taggart's Address before the Nor- 
 tTiumherland County Exhihition, Oct. 19, 185.3. 

Agriculture is profitable, for it is the true source of wealth 
 not only to individuals, but to nations. Gold and silver, be- 
 cause scarce, and in times past hard to be got, have been 
 chosen as the represent.atives of the real wealth of the world 
 yet of themselves comparatively useless. To a man on adescr 
 island, yonder bag of wheat or yellow corn were worth more 
 than mountains of glittering gold! The one possesses sub- 
 stantial intrinsic value of its own; the other would be worth 
 less than the fertile dust beneath his feet. Agriculture is 
 profitable, for it affords an almost certain livelihood, and al- 
 though it does not furnish the opportunities for rapid wealth 
 and sudden speculation, neither is it subject to those sad re- 
 verses, which too often shake the worlds of manufactures and 
 commerce to their centres. 

It is pleasant — in my humble judgment, by far the most 
 pleasant of all the pursuits of men. This is evinced by the 
 fact that men of all callings, merchants, manufacturers, law- 
 yers, doctors, (I was going to add, editors and preachers, but 
 they seldom get rich, probably owing to their honesty,) when 
 they have gathered wealth, by the economy and toil of early 
 and middle life, turn to this, as pastime for their descending 
 years. If I were the owner of waving corn fields and low- 
 ing herds, "I would not call the king my uncle." I would 
 not envy the lot of anj' man on earth, not even the aspiring 
 politician, the patriotic ofiice seeker, who sighs for an oppor- 
 tunity to serve his country, and mourns the ingratitude that 
 refuses the opportunity — not even the pale student, who 
 pores over musty books at midnight, with dim eyes, bent 
 frame and wrinkled brow — dim, bent and wrinkled before 

their time — nor the adventurous merchant whose all may bo 
 overwhelmed by a dashing wave— nor the soldier, whose 
 footsteps to glory, have been through fields of blood — over 
 carcasses which his "red right hand" has robbed of happiness, 
 hope and life ! I would not envy the monarch on his throne, 
 for I should bo monarch of a realm, which brought no cares, 
 but such as made me happy. 

It is honorable, because it is essential, healthful, profitable 
 and pleasant — it is honorable, because the good and great, the 
 high and mighty ones of the earth, have followed it for a pas- 
 time or a profession. George Washington was a farmer, 
 and during all his life no conversation pleased him so well ' 
 as that which referred to Agriculture. Andrew Jackson and 
 Henry Clay vrere farmers, and Uennitago and Ashland will 
 bo wan with the weight of ten thousand years, before their 
 names shall be forgotten ! Daniel Webster was a farmer, and 
 happier among the beautiful herds of Marshfield, than when 
 Senates and Cabinets hung upon his words, or Austrian Min- 
 isters wilted before his pen. 

When Rome, .afterwards the mightiest city of ancient times, 
 was girt about by her foes, when the conquering armies of 
 Jjlqui and Volsci were pressing her to the verge of destruc- 
 tion, she summoned a plowman from his plow, and invested 
 him with more than regal power. That plowman's word be- 
 came the absolute law of the Republic. The Conscript Fath- 
 ers bowed to his dictation, and proud patricians obeyed with- 
 out questioning. The jewelled fingers of Rome's loftiest no- 
 bles were pointed, not in scorn, but admiration at the broad 
 brow of the sun burnt fiirmer. By his wisdom and courage the 
 Republic was saved, and Cincinnatus returned from victo- 
 rious armies and shouting multitudes to his crops and his 
 cattle ! 

Then shall this ancient, essential, healthful, profitable, 
 pleasant and honorable Art stand still, while every other Art 
 and Science is pressing on with rapid footsteps to startling 
 results .and mighty achievements? AVhile JIanufacturers 
 and Commerce build up proud cities, and adorn them with 
 the tropies of their success, shall the tillers of the soil follow 
 wooden plows in the same furrows that were turned by their 
 ancestors, some hundred j'cars ago? While the Lightning 
 bears our messages, and an element not less mighty propels 
 our cars upon land, and our ships upon the sea, bearing the 
 products of our fields with ten times the celerity as when 
 our fathers or grandfathers occupied the places we now hold, 
 shall those products be reared with the same toil and of no 
 better quality than when they reared them? 

The answer has gone forth, not from the tiller of the soil 
 alone, but from the Bench, the Bar, the Preacher's study, 
 the Physician's ofiice, and the Mechanic's workshop, for all 
 are willing to unite in the delightful task of improving the 
 cultivation of the fields, and thereby improving every man's 
 means of living, his convenience comfort and happiness — 
 they have answered — you have answered by your presence 
 here to-day : "Agriculture shall not stand still. It shall 
 keep pace with its sister arts." 

How shall it be made to keep pace? By the establishment 
 of societies like this — by the foundation and circulation of 
 papers devoted to it; by men learning not only from their 
 own experience, but from the experience of all other men 
 engaged in the same pursuit. It is this combination of mind 
 and interchange of experience, which give to civilized men 
 men having a written language, their immeasurable superi'pji 
 ority over savages, whose thoughts and experiments can only 
 be transmitted to posterity by word of mouth. 

If any man doulits the efficiency of the agents I have spo- 
 ken of, let him go first into a country where Agricultural So- 
 cieties and Agricultural Presses have been at work for a 
 number of years, and then into a region where such things
