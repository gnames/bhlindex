VALTJE OF LIME. 

Extracts from the address of the Hon. A. Hayes, of Lan- 
 caster, Pa., dolivored at the Agricultural Exhibition at 
 York, Pa., October 7, 1853. 

On a visit, two years ago, to one of our least fertile town- 
 ships, I was surprised at the flourishing condition of the 
 farms, where the land was naturally so thin and unpromi- 
 sing. The fields were covered with a luxuriant vegetation, 
 and the buildings, orchards and fences, proclaimed that the 
 proprietors were well doing, .and, to use an expressive 
 phrase, lived at home. I was told that appearances, in this 
 instance, did not deceive ; that within ten years a revolution 
 had been wrought by the use of lime ; and that whereas, 15 
 years ago, the man who owned 40 or 50 acres of land, in 
 that neighborhood, was sure to starve on it if he had no 
 other resources, now, the owner of such a tract would grow 
 rich from its products. And in fact this land, under the new 
 plan of dressing it with lime, produced as good crops as the 
 limestone lands in the rich valley of Pequea. There are 
 other parts of that county, where the lauds, by the applica- 
 tion of lime, have been enhanced in v.aluo from 500 to 1000 
 per cent. The value, indeed, which h.as already been added 
 to real property in Liinoaster county, by lime, it is impossi- 
 ble to calculate; and yet the use of it is but fairly begun. I 
 think it is safe to s.ay, that, within a quarter of a century 
 from this time, it will treble the annual production of the 
 whole county. 

More than twenty j^ears ago, I was accustomed to pass 
 several times a year .along the road from Reading to Lan- 
 caster, and just after leaving a tract of hilly woodland, 
 called the Forest, came, in the course of this journey, to a 
 village, now the Borough of Adamstown. It lies in a very 
 narrow valley, between pretty lofty hills. The soil is the 
 rod sand-stone; and it was, at that time, thin and apparently 
 unproductive. The farms in the vicinity might have been 
 purchased, as I have been informed, for SlO or $15 an acre. 
 Ten or twelve years since they beg.an to lime their land ; 
 and two farms, in that vicinity, have within the la.st three 
 years been actu.ally sold for $100 an acre. This land is now 
 as productive as any in the county. Facts like these should 
 convince every skeptic of the value of lime. They are par- 
 ticularly encouraging here, when there is so much land pre- 
 cisely of the kind, on which the application of lime would 
 place an enhanced value of 500 to 1000 per cent. Is there 
 any other means by which wealth can be .so certainly and 
 speedily .accumulated? The owner of a small farm, valued, 
 say at Si 000, in two or three years, maj', by an outbiy of a 
 few hundred dollars, which will be more than reimbursed in 
 the mean time by his increased crops, find himself worth 
 $5000. 

In view of su;'h facts, it would be perfectly idle to enter 
 upon the <liscus.-ion of the question, (if question it may be 
 willed) whether lirao is a fertilizer, or whether it is benefi- 
 cial or not. Assuming that it was one of the most impor- 

tant means of improving the soil â€” in what manner ought it 
 to be applied ? 

The quality or condition of the soil must always be re- 
 garded, in determining this question. If it be one of con- 
 siderable strength, already capable of producing a heavy 
 vegetation, and is full of insect life, then, it would seem, 
 the lime should be applied quick from the kiln and plough- 
 ed in, so that its action upon the organic substances may be 
 exerted with energy, converting into nutritious sustenance 
 for the crops, the vegetable as well as the living animal 
 matters with which, in so many various forms, the soil is re- 
 plete. It is known to be very destructive to grub worms, 
 animalcula3, and insects of all descriptions, with which the 
 ground is tenanted ; and the soil is natur.ally made richer by 
 their dissolution. If the soil is thin and gravelly, it maybe 
 better to apply it to the surface, as .a top dressing, and after 
 it has been for sometime slaked. Such soils are supposed to 
 require a loss quantity of lime, and show the eflTect of the 
 application more strikingly than those which are stronger. 
 While it apparently gives a greater consistency to the for- 
 mer, it operates upon stiff, clayey lands in such a manner as 
 to render them mellow and friable. 

Lime has also the remarkable property of attracting 
 moisture from the atmosphere; which makes it invaluable in 
 our dry seasons, enabling the crops to bear the effects of 
 our long summer droughts with comparatively small in- 

jiiry. 

But not only is there a great variety in soils, but also in 
 the constituents of the limestone rock, and consequently in 
 the quality of lime, which is manufactured from it : there- 
 fore, in order to reap all the benefit derivable from this 
 substance, the lime as well as the ground should bo anal- 
 yzed. 

There are some instances, (though these arc rare,) in 
 which lime appears to have had no effect on land. A neigh- 
 bor of mine, while I was spreading lime over my ground, 
 professed his utter want of faith in its efficacy, and on my 
 inquiring the reason, told me ho had applied lime to a farm 
 he lived upon a few years before, lying along the river, 
 near the borough of Washington, and he could not see, that 
 it ever benefited his laud, to the value of one silver six- 
 pence. 

Dr. , of Pequea valley, also informed me, that in 

using lime upon his farm, he had observed that iu one of his 
 fields it was perfectly inert, producing no effect at all : this 
 lay along the Pequea creek, whereas, on the other fields of 
 his place, it was of manifest advantage. 

The true explanation of such facts, I t.ake to be, that 
 these soils had already abundance of lime in theui ; adding 
 more was, therefore, mere superfluity. A proper analysis 
 would have saved these persons their bootless expenditure 
 of money, time and labor. 

Chemistry, a science of modern growth, has been of in- 
 calculable service to .\griculture. It has disclosed the fact 
 that lime enters into the composition of all plants, and es- 
 pecially of the cereal grains and grasses. We perceive in 
 this a reason why the deeper soils of valleys and what are 
 called the river bottom lands, with their rich loam, should 
 be replete with this substance mixed with the soil. Depos- 
 ited on all adjacent higher grounds by the dccayeil and do- 
 composed vegetable and animal remains, it is carried down 
 by rains and snows, in the course of ages, and left on the 
 lower. Hence its abundance there, and its pciircity on grav- 
 elly eminences and the hill-sidos. The application of chem- 
 istry to agriculture has further shown, that tliere are certain 
 constituents essential to every fertile soil, though the pro- 
 portion.<< in which they exist are not determined, and can 
 only be ascertained by many and careful experiments, made 
 for the purpose. Those constituents are lime, potash, mag- 
 nesia, soda, alumina or clay, silica or sand, humus, iron ns 
 a peroxide, chlorine, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, and
