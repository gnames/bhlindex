animal and vegetable or orgauic mutter. 

Each of these substances, — in some quantit}', — must ab- 
 solutely bo present ; an abundance or excess of any or all 
 t'.ie rest, will not atono for the want of it. As to lime, 
 which may appear to be receiving undue attention, it enters 
 into the constitution of all plants and of every part of them, 
 existing combined with various acids in the root, stalk, 
 blade, and grain, or seed. In animals, it forms with phos- 
 phoric acid a large proportion of the bony structure. Its 
 application, therefore, is directly beneficial to the growth of 
 the plant, .as any food, which promotes the growth of the 
 nnimal is beneficial : but it is of still further benefit, by aid- 
 ing the decomposition of vegetable matters in the soil, and 
 thereby disengaging the mineral substances they contained 
 when organized, and fitting them for the support of a new 
 growth. 

Lime is also believed to be a powerful solvent of the sand 
 in soils, which contains many of the elements of plants ; 
 these being sot free by its action, minister to the growth of 
 vegetation. This, by many, is regarded as one of its most 
 important properties. As a fertilizer it combines qualities 
 not often united, being not only rapid and powerful in its 
 action, but it is also durable. Many are the instances, in 
 which its effects have been visible twenty years after it was 
 applied. In this respect, it excels all other manures. In 
 most of them, indeed, it enters more or less largely as a 
 component p.art, whether they consist of animal or vegeta- 
 ble remains. It is a material constituent of the most costly 
 of the concentrated fertilizers. It is recommended by its 
 cheapness and its adaptation to all sorts of lands, for with 
 extremely few and rare exceptions, it is never applied with- 
 out essential advantftge ; and it is particularly commended 
 to the fiirmers and land owners of York county, .as afford- 
 ing the ready and sure means of rendering the thin, gravel- 
 ly, unproductive soils of your hilly townships, as productive 
 as those of your fat and luxuriant valleys. Though we 
 have suggested some considerations for determining how it 
 sliould be applied, yet it certainly is a characteristic of 
 lime, that apply it how you will, whether as top-dressing or 
 ploughed in with the seed, whether fresh from the kiln or 
 after it has lain for weeks and months exposed to the air, — 
 under all circumstances, — it is beneficial. 

Large Deciduous Cypresses. 
 We find in the English Gardeners' Chronicle the follow- 
 ing as the dimensions of what is quoted as an enormous 
 Cypress tree, quite a lusus naturce there. It is growing 
 in the vicarage of Boxley, Kent: height GO feet, the 
 spread of the lower brandies, which feather quite to the 
 ground about 45 feet, girth 9 feet 4 inches at 2 feet from 
 the ground, and 7 feet 3 inches at 6 feet. It stands on 
 on the edge of a small pond, in which its roots luxuriate, 
 being natural to swampy ground. The thought occurred 
 to us what is the girt of that magnificent specimen grow- 
 ing in the Bartram Garden, rhiladelpliia, and in a simi- 
 l-.ir situation, near a small pond, if we recollect rightly. 
 Perhaps our friend T. Meehan can inform us. In Bux- 
 ton's Mexico, a cypress is alluded to, which would girth 
 17 yards, over fifty feet, and there were many others of 
 equal size on the Chapultepec heights, near Mexico, 
 some of which were sadly battered by the American can- 
 non at tlie time of the storming of the fort. That our 
 English cousins should consider a tree of nine feet girth, 
 worthy of a newspaper p.aragraph, shows at least that 
 they have not been to America, and reminds us of the 
 Englishman, who was relating with great gusto to his 
 American visitor the natural wonders of their Island, and 
 among other things, as a fact, whether he believed it or 

not, that their great river, the Thames, was really 150 
 miles long. He had never heard of that small stream, 
 the Mississippi, over 2000 miles in length.

Durham Bull "Napier." 
 Our friend John Worth, near West Chester, who is be- 
 coming somewhat celebrated as a breeder of improved 
 cattle and sheep, has within a few days past disposed of 
 this magnificent Bull, to William Mcl'oy, Esq., Pendle- 
 ton county, Virginia. He has already started and we 
 hope to hear of his safe arrival at his new quarters. 
 "Napier" was a very stylish Bull, and took our fancy, 
 when we first saw him, so much that we engaged an ar- 
 tist to draw his portrait, some months ago, as a model 
 Bull in many points, and we hope to have it engraved 
 for the Farm .Journal. lie is coming three years old, 
 was bred by H. Vail of New York, who sold him to T. 
 P. Remington, of Philadelphia, from whom he was pur- 
 chased by John Worth. He has some of the Bates blood, 
 now so highly valued. His dam was Fanny, got by Me- 
 teor, out of the celebrated Oxford cow. We assure the 
 farmers of Pendleton county, they have got a valuable 
 animal. 

Tree of Ten Thousand Images. 

If Ave had not heard so many nu^rvellous accounts 
 of the perform-ances and skill of Japanese Gardeners and 
 Florists, we should discredit the subjoined account at 
 once, which is taken from the English Gardeners' Chroni- 
 cle. When however it is related as a fact, in the Botan- 
 ical Register, of a dwarf tree being exhibited at Jeddo in a 
 lacquered box with branches, occupying ten square inches, 
 we are prepared for ajiy thing else. Gardening in China 
 and Japan, if accounts are true, has attained a point, to 
 which there is not even an approximation elsewhere. It 
 cannot even be compared with anything we know, be- 
 cause we know of nothing like it. Trees and plants with 
 them seem to be like clay in the hands of a potter, forced 
 or stunted in growth and habit, twisted, inverted or 
 moulded into fantastic shapes, to suit the fancy. The ar- 
 ticle is as follows : 

I have lately become acquainted with a young man, by 
 birth a budhist, and a native of Mongol Tartar}', now eon- 
 verted to Chistianity. lie told me that he had been a pil- 
 grimage with his father, when a boj', to the tree of 10,000 
 images, an account of which is given in Hue's Travels in 
 Tartary. I remember seeing an article relating to it in your 
 columns, in which the truth of the story was doubted. I 
 have, therefore, thought it might be interesting to you to 
 hear from an eye-witness, and one whose word I have no 
 reason to doubt, his account of this marvellous production. 
 His description, which I wrote down from his own dictation, 
 is as follows, viz : — The tree is near the wall of China, in the 
 city of Cayiio ^?) ; the heighth of the tree is 8 (que SO) feet, 
 and the trunk five men could not embrace. The leaves are 
 of different colors, which no dimbt has been done by the 
 Llamas ; ever}- leaf has a character and the same in each, 
 which would signify in all the Arabic writings, T — In 
 August the tree begins to produce leaves, and they spread 
 the same as feathers, whicli are also of difl'erent colors ; and 
 this tree exists now as the (irinciple oliject of worship in 
 Tartary, and which people visit on jiilgrimage. Fr(!ni his 
 description of the leaf I thought it resembled the Magnolia 
 and in showing him one, he immediately identified it. He 
 said that the character was caused by some kind of grafting 
 when the tree was young, and that the leaf has it from its 
 earliest appearance. Ho also assured me that he could col- 
 lect leaves in the same manner as on the tree. Though 
 this account differs in sotuc points from Hue's it certainly 
 confirms it to a great extent. — Sttmnvt Gurncy, jun.
