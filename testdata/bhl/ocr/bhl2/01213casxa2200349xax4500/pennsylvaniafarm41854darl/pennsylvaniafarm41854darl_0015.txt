HESSIAN FLY. 

Agreoalilj tu promise in last number, and the request of 
 our friend J. 11. Alexander, we give engravings of tbe male 
 and feuialo Winged Hessian Fly — with a detailed description, 
 of its different stages, and habits. We think it can be easily 
 recognized by the close observer. 

The first scientific description of the Hession fly was pub- 
 lished in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of 
 Philadelphia, for July, 1817, No. 3. i. 45, by the late distin- 
 guished entomologist, Thomas Say. He there gives it the 
 systematic name of the cccidoitvjia destructor ; and to his de- 
 scription adds a few remarks relative to its habits, and fur- 
 nishes, also, an account of another insect, by which the fly 
 is often destroyed. Without going into a minute and tedious 
 technical description, the following account is offered as prob- 
 ably sufficient to enable an observer to identify the insect in 
 its various transformations : the Hessian fly is a two winged 
 insect, with head, eyes and thorax black ; the head is small 
 and depressed ; the palpi, or mouth feelers, are three or four 
 jointed — the basal one being the smallest ; the antennse are 
 about half as long as the body, and consist each of 14 to 17 
 oval joints, beside the basal joint, which appears double ; the 
 wings are large, hairy, rounded at the tip, and have each two 
 or three longitudinal nervures ; the abdomen is of a tawny 
 red, and furnished, irregularly, with many black hairs ; con- 
 sists of seven rings or segments, besides the ovipositor, which 
 i.s of two sides, and of a rose-red colour; the ovipositor, when 
 extended to the utmost, is about one-third as long as the ab- 
 domen ; length of the body, from the front of the head to the 
 end of the al)domcn, about one-eighth of an inch; the legs 
 are long an.l slender, pale red, and covered sparsely with 
 dark hair. The male is equal in size to the female, but gen- 
 erally less black, with antenna) somewhat longer, and about 
 three-fourths the length of the body. The joints of the 
 aaitennae are globular, and slightly separated from each oth- 
 er. Several other species of the genus cocidomyia, or one 
 closely allied to it, are common in this region. But the 
 Hessian fly is the largest and darkest of our species with 
 which I am acquainted. 

The eggs are laid in the long creases or furrows of the up- 
 per sui-face of the leaves, — i. e., the blade or ou-ap-shaped 
 part — the young wheat plant. '■ 

While depositing her eggs, the insect stands with her head 
 towards the point or extremity of the leaf, and at various 
 distances between the point and where the leaf joins and sur- 
 rounds the stalk. The number found on a single leaf varies 
 from a single egg up to thirty, or even more, '''bo egg is 
 about a fifteenth of an inch long, cylindrical, rounded at the 
 ends, glossy and translucent, of a pale red colour, becoming 
 in a few hours, irregularly spotted with deeper red. Between 
 its exclusion .and its hatching, these red spots are continually 

changing in number, size, and position ; and sometimes 
 nearly all disappear. A little while before hatching, two la- 
 teral rows of opaque white spots about ten in number, can be 
 seen in each egg. In four days, more or less, according to 
 the weather, the egg is hatched ; the little wrinkled maggot, 
 or larva creeps out of the delicate membranous egg-skin, 
 crawls down the leaf, enters the sheath, and proceeds along 
 the stalk, usually as far as the next joint below. Here it 
 fastens, lengthwise and head downwards, to the tender stalk 
 and lives upon the saj). It does not gnaw the stalk, nor does 
 it enter the central cavity thereof; but, as the larva increases 
 in size, it gradually becomes imbedded in the substance of 
 the stalk. After taking its station the larva moves no more, 
 gradually loses its reddish colour and wrinkled appearance, 
 becomes plump and torpid, is at first semi-translucent, and 
 then more and more clouded with internal white spots; and 
 when near maturity, the middle of the intestinal parts is of a 
 greenish colour. In five or six weeks — varj'ing with the 
 season — the larva begins to turn brown, and soon becomes 
 of a bright chesuut colour. In that state, the insect bears 
 some resemblance to a flax-seed; and many observers speak 
 of this as the yfor^r-seerf state. The larva has now become a 
 chrysalis, or pupa, and takes no more food. The pupa with- 
 in gradually cleaves off from the outer skin, and, in the 
 course of two or three weeks, is entirely detached from it, eo 
 thattheskinof the larva — nowbrownand hardened, and of a 
 sort of leathery texture — has become a case or shell for the 
 pupa inside. The pupa shell is, of course, in size and form, 
 like the larva : it is oval, bulging out beneath, and of the 
 same curve above as the outside of the stalk ; divided by 
 cross lines into twelve segments, and is aboutan eighth of an 
 inch long. Within this shell the pupa gradually advances 
 towards the winged state ; it contracts in length, but not in 
 breadth ; and its skin appears covered with minute eleva- 
 tions. Just before evolution, we find the pupa invested in a 
 delicate membrane, or scarf, — which, not long previous, was 
 its outer skin through which many parts of the future fly may 
 bo distinctly seen. Finally, this scarf splits along the thorax, 
 or back, and the insect comes forth, both from this and tho 
 pupa shell, <a perfect two-winged fly. 

This is, in brief, the history of an individual which has 
 been so fortunate as to escape all the numerous enemies with 
 which its race is surrounded from the moment the egg is de- 
 posited ; but of these more hereafter. 

In the northern and middle States, at least, winter wheat 
 is sown in September or October. Soon after the plants have 
 appeared above ground, the Hessian fly begins to lay her 
 eggs upon them ; and this operation is continued during 
 several weeks, according to the season. The eggs laid on the 
 green leaves are in a few days hatched, and tho young larvaj 
 crawl down the stalk, and take their stations ; generally 
 clustering around tho stalk at the nearest joint below. Hero, 
 by sucking tho plant, thej' increase in size, become full and 
 hard, and pressing deeply into the stalk, they impair its 
 growth ; and if their number about one joint is large, tho 
 stalk is kiUed. Fre(iuently the plant, although impoverish- 
 ed, advances far enough to head out; but when the grain 
 begins to fill, its own weight, or perhaps the wind, causes 
 the stalk to break down. The injury done to the wheat is 
 occasioned by the exhaustion of tho sap, and by the pressure 
 on the yielding stalk. 

In five or six weeks the larva) stop feeding, the outer skin 
 turns brown, and within this brown and Icatliery case the 
 pupa; pass the winter — generally a little below the surface of 
 the earth. In April and M.ay the fl}' is again found deposit- 
 ing her eggs on the same wheat, — viz, : that from grain 
 sown the preceding autumn, — and also on the spring wheat 
 which has just come up. These eggs hatch, and the larva)
