hauls clay and mixes with the sandâ€” gives it a good coat 
 of manure, or follows a system of g%een manuring. 

To get the clay is often impracticable, and if found in 
 abundance it would not answer alone. The manure can 
 only be obtained at the expense of some other place. 
 But the system of green manuring is the most scientific. 
 Before such soil will produce anything it must contain 
 organic matter. How is this organic matter to be sup- 
 plied in a barren, sandy plain ? Why plant something 
 that will grow on the soil and then plough it down. It 
 would appear impossible to get anythhig to grow on such 
 soil, but this country abounds with a kind of broom, (a 
 species of genista,) none of the kind occurs in Chester 
 county; that near Oxford village being larger. This 
 plant grows on the barren soil, and after two or three 
 years it is cut off and used for fire wood, and the ground 
 which has been somewhat improved by the introduction 
 of roots, is next sown with buckwheat, which being 
 plowed down prepares the ground for potatoes or rye. 
 Finally a crop of clover is raised, and then with the ju- 
 dicious use of all the vegetable matter that comes off in 
 the form of straw, &c., it is kept in tolerably good order. 
 But to see the peasant working on this land, with the 
 barren, or the broom covered heath close beside him, 
 you feel almost as though you were looking at a man 
 drowning. He is working away over the sand piles, and 
 if he relax his energies a year it falls back into death- 
 like poverty. His only hope for existence is to labor, 
 and labor incessantbj. In a few instances I saw them 
 burning dust to spread on the land, and if I mistake not 
 they sometimes dig up the broom, and burn the dust it 
 grows in, roots and all. Thei-e are exceptions to this 
 kind of soil in some places, when we see very fine beets, 
 cabbage and other garden vegetables, at this season of 
 the year. Along the small rivers and creeks that empty 
 into the Elbe is, in many places, excellent land ; but in 
 such places it is almost invariably too wet, rendering it 
 necessary to throw the land up into rolling lands, so that 
 it resembles soil ploughed in lands with very deep 
 "cleaning up furrows," in which the water stands. But 
 more generally the lands are still higher in the middle, 
 and instead of cleaning up farrows, a ditch runs be- 
 tween them, that drains the water out of the land. But 
 when drained out, it stands in the ditch, the country be- 
 ing too level to carry it away. Along these rivulets are 
 hundreds of acres, every acre of which is cut up by 
 scores of these little ditches, and occasionally a large 
 ditch runs throiigh the whole to convey off the water. 
 But the most remarkable characteristic of farming this 
 kind of land is, that in many parts of Holland, where 
 the low wet land is very rich, they pump the water out 
 of the land with wind pumps. What think j-ou farmers 
 of going down into yom* swampy meadow and digging 
 several ditches through them, not to lead the water off 

ing to learn more of agi-iculture in Holland, as I wish to 
 make a trip through the most important agricultural 
 parts of that country on foot. The iron horse gives but 
 little time for observation. 

As we approach Magdeburg, the land improves, and 
 around this town is found one of the finest corn and veg- 
 etable raising countries in Europe. The land around 
 this city appears to be of excellent quality, though it is 
 low and not requiring much ditching. The cause of the 
 sudden transition from sandy plains and ban-en heaths 
 to fertile fields, is due to the course and charac- 
 ter of the drift, which consists, for the most part, of 
 pure sand, rounded pebbles, and rocks, lying loose in 
 the sand. Soil similar, with the exception of its bar- 
 renness, may be seen in many places, a few miles on 
 either side of the Susquehanna and Delaware rivers. 

The sand on the western shores of Holland has come 
 from the ocean, and differs from the drift in containing 
 no large stones. The wind often blows it to great dis- 
 tances into the country, rendering land once fertile en- 
 tirely barren; but the effect of the winds has of late 
 years been checked by annually sowing a very deep 
 rooted plant on it, (arundo arenaria, ) which by its roots 
 holds the sand fast. Indeed, to see a people harrasseJ 
 with sand coming from the ocean; or living on a vast 
 sandy plain, or pumping the water out of their fields, 
 and building immense dykes to keep the ocean off them; 
 and even as I shall hereafter notice pumping tlie water 
 out of lakes, and keeping it pumped out, to get land and 
 raise substance from, is to know the blessing of living 
 in a country where land is abundant. But my half sheet 
 is full. Farewell. E- T-

 James Gowen's Address and Guenon. 
 In looking over an address delivered before the Mercer 
 County Agricultural Society by James Gowen, Esq., I 
 see under the head of "Humbuggery and Quackery," he 
 ranks "Guenon's System of Judging Milk Cows." As 
 I feel a little tenacious on that subject, and have proved 
 the system correct by many years' experience, I thought 
 it would not be out of place to ask a few questions 
 through the Farm Journal. 1st. Has Mr. Gowen ever 
 studied Guenon's work, and applied it enough to find its 
 incorrectness. 2d. Has he ever found a well marked 
 cow that was not a good milker, and an inferior marked 
 cow that was a good milker. 3d. As he makes mention 
 of "the cut of the hair," did he ever see a long, scanty 
 haired animal that was a good animal for milk or feed- 
 ing properties. On this mainly depends the Guenon 
 theory. I think there are more facts classed under 
 the head of quackery in his address than have been 
 dreamed of in his philosophy, and it would be proper for 

persons, who profess to be teachers and pronounce 
 to a low point where it v.ill run away, but to conduct it ' things humbugs that they don't imderstand, to inform
