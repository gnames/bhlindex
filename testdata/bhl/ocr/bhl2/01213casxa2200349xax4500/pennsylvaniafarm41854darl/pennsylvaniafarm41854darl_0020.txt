The Apple Tree Borer. 

Mr. Editor : — This being the season for planting 
 fruit trees, I avail myself of the opportunity offered by 
 your very valuable Journal, to give you a communication 
 on the above subject. 

Tliis destructive insect has of late become so trouble- 
 some, that it is with the greatest care and constant at- 
 tention, that its ravages can be checked. It is the 
 larva of a beetle called Saperda Bivitata, the two striped 
 or the brown and white striped Saperda ; the upper 
 side of its body being marked with two longitudinal 
 white stripes, between three of a light brown color, while 
 the face, the antennae, the underside of the body and 
 legs are white. 

As is well known, the perfect insect in the beetle form, 
 makes its appearance in the latter part of May, or the 
 beginning of June : It is beautiful, so much so, that 
 one unaccjuainted with it and its pernicious habits, would 
 spare its life. In length it is about ^ of an inch. 

"It is said to make its escape from the trunks of trees 
 in the night : during which time only, it flies from tree, 
 to tree, in search of companions and food. During the 
 day it is at rest among the leaves of plants it eats; it lays 
 its eggs in June and July, upon the bark, near the i-oot 
 during the night." The grub cuts a cylindrical open- 
 ing through the bark, and pushes backwards through 
 the hole its excrements, which consists of a plug of 
 woody fibres ; in this place of concealment it remains for 
 2 or 3 years. 

The fully gro^vn grub is about an inch in length, has 
 a hard homey head and claws. At this age it makes 
 its final transformation, and gnaws itself through the 
 bark. 

Among the remedies recommended against this com- 
 mon enemy, are killing with wire thrust in the hole, cut- 
 ting the grub out with a knife or gouge, or putting cam- 
 phor in the hole, and plug it up with soft wood. 

But to prevent (preventives are always better than 
 cures) all this trouble and damage, is what we want. — 
 That in my opinion can be accomplished, in a young or- 
 chard that has had no attack of this insect, by a square 
 box, of 1^ or 2 feet high, sufficiently wide to last for 
 several years, to reach at least one inch or more into the 
 ground, around the trunk of each tree, the box to be 
 closed at the top with fine grass &c., covered with a coat 
 of lime mortar, and the tree well whitewashed up to the 
 first limbs. The box can be opened, and left open 'till 
 April, or beginning of May, for air and moisture if that 
 be requisite.

Education of Farmers' Sons— A Word of Advice. 

The moderate means of most American farmers pre- 
 clude the possibility of giving their sons a classical, or 
 even a very liberal education. Usually after their sons 
 arrive at an age when their labor can be profitably em- 
 ployed, their schooling is curtailed to the winter months, 
 when tliey can be best spared fi-om the farm. Some are 
 then scut to boarding schools, but the far greater number 
 to the public schools, which at this season are generally 
 crowded, and not unfrequently conducted by ineflacient 
 teachers. This being the case, it is evident, they must 

rely, in a great measure, upon their own exertions in ac- 
 quiring an education, and as they shall improve tlieir 
 time, so will they be, comparatively, well informed or 
 ignorant. 

My advice to these, each and every one, is, that what- 
 ever you undertake to learn, do it ihoroiighly. Pass no 
 rule, or section, or study of any kind, without under- 
 standing it. Recollect that we chiefly leai-n what is un- 
 known by means of what we already know. Division is 
 very easily learned by a student who tlioroughly under- 
 stands subtraction and multiplication, but it is very diffi- 
 cult, indeed impossible, for a scholar to understand it 
 without a knowledge of these two preceding rules. All 
 the subsequent examples in the arithmetic are solved by 
 means of one or more of the first four, or primary rules. 
 So in geometry. If the student fails to fully comprehend 
 the first proposition, he can never thoroughly understand 
 those that come after it. The same may be said of al- 
 most every other elementary study. For a student to 
 run over, without understanding these little foundation 
 rules, is like a builder who attempts to rear a struc- 
 ture without first securing a good foundation. Before he 
 proceeds far, he has to tear down and take a fresh start, 
 or he can never raise his building to a respectable 
 height. 

Another piece of advice I have to give is to get up 
 early. Most farmers son's have the cattle to feed, the 
 horses to curry, &c. Remember that one of the first 
 requisites of a successful farmer is early rising. A pros- 
 perous farmer who lays abed after daylight would be a 
 greater curiosity than any Barnum has in his museum. 
 If you adopt the custom of early rising before the hab- 
 its are fully formed, you will find it easy to do so in after 
 life. The morning, too, is the best time to study. The 
 mind is then clear and fresh and it is not half so difficult 
 to study a lesson as in the after part of the day. An 
 hour before day to the student, is worth two after dark. 

Too much care cannot be taken by persons attending 
 school to preserve the health. Most school houses are 
 badly ventilated ; the confined air is loaded with carbonic 
 acid gas — a poisonous vapor given off by the lungs in 
 breathing. Sleeping apartments, too, are generally with- 
 out chimnies or other means of constant ventilation, and 
 are calculated to impair the health. But worse than either 
 of these, is the custom of many sleeping with their 
 heads covered in cold weather, breathing the same at- 
 mosphere over and over again. This impairs the health, 
 renders the mind less active, and less clear, and conse- 
 quently retards the progi-ess of the scholar in his studies, 
 as well as the robust and full development of the body. 

I shall have something to say in continuation of the 
 subject in a subsequent number.

Futui'e Housekeepers. 

We sometimes catch ourselves wondering how many of 
 the young ladies whom we meet with, are to perform the part 
 of housokeepors, when the young men who now eye them so 
 admiringly have persuaded them to become their wives. 

We listen to those young ladies of whom we speak, and 
 hear them not only acknowledging, but boasting of their ig- 
 norance of all housework duties, as if nothing would so low- 
 er them in the esteem of their friends, as the confession of 
 an ability to bake bread and pies, to cook a piece of meat,
