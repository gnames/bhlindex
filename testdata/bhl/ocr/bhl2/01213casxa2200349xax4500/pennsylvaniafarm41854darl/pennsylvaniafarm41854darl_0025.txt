them to remain twenty-four hours, at the expiration of 
 I which time I find them heated to a high degree, which fa- 
 cilitates the action of the acid upon ttem. I now dilute 
 the acid in a separate vessel, and after the heat Tjvolved by 
 the unison of the acid and water has subsided, I pour it, 
 in small quantities at a time, upon the bone-s, carefully 
 stirring the mass so as completely to mix the acid with 
 the bones, and eontinuo to do so ufitil all the acid is mix- 
 «d with the bones, after which I cover the tubs carefully, 
 so as to retain the heat A thorough stirring and mixing 
 of the mas-s will be needed three or four times for twenty- 
 four or thirty-six hours, at the end of which time the pro- 
 cess is completed, and a better article furnished than can 
 be obtained by the method of Professor Norton after full 
 two weeks of vare and toil. 

At this stage of the process the Super-Phosphate is a 
 pulpy mass of the consistency of soft soaj), and of course 
 unlit to sow broadcast, or to be regularly applied to the 
 soil. To prepare it for this purpose, I strew upon my 
 barn floor saw dust, dry mould or well leached wood ash- 
 es, from two to three inches thick ; upon this I spread 
 the compound as evenly a-s I can, then cover it with more 
 of the same article used to dry it, and proceed with fork 
 and rake to mix up the whole mass until it is intimately 
 incorporated, when it is fit a-t once to be put npon the 
 land. 

The Super-Phosphate of Lime is held by intelligent and 
 judicious farmers, both in Europe and America, to be one 
 of the most valuable fertilizers, and when suitably applied 
 is capable of proxlucing the most astonishing results. To 
 the American farmer it is easily accessible, and perfectly 
 available at comparatively low cost. From my own ex- 
 perience in its use, I am warranted in saying that it will 
 repay its cost more than three fold when judiciously used, 
 and at some subsequent time I may furnish you with a detail 
 ©f the results of that experience, which will fully sustain 
 all I have said in its favor.

Mr. Editou:— Yours of the 28th has just come to 
 hand — and in reply to your inquiry relating to my ex- 
 perience and opinion of the double Michigan Plow. I 
 would state that I consider it "the Plow." I used it last 
 spring in ploughing ahout thirty-eight acres for corn and 
 consider it the best I have ever used. During the time I 
 have been engaged in farming, I havt; had in use 
 quite a number of different kinds of plows, but none gave 
 such entire satisfaction as the Michigan plow. 

We did not raise as much corn per acre this season, as 
 last, but considering all things, I think it a very fair crop. 
 On one field of twelve acres and 17 perches, we had 
 96 bushels per acre; and on another field containing a 
 little over twenty-five and three-quarter acres, we had 

70^ bushels per acre, making in all about 3128 bushels 
 on a little less than 38 acres, or 82 bushels to the acre 
 on the whole. Yours very respectfully,

Another error, which is often remarked here and in other 
 sections of the county, in the management of the cultivated 
 parts of the farm, is the shallow and small nmount of plow- 
 ing it receives. Your experience has taught you that the 
 efficiency of soils in producing good crops depends much on 
 the subsoil. "If this," says Allen in his Farm Book, ''con- 
 sists of impervious clay or hard pan, which prevents the 
 drainage of the water, it is evident the accumulation of 
 heavy rains will injure the vegetation above, for it is certain 
 that while nothing teads more to productiveness than an ade- 
 quate supply of moisture for the roots, nothing is more in- 
 jurious than their immersion in standing water." Much of 
 our soil is of this character. As you penetrate the earth, 
 after having gone a few inches below the surface, the soil 
 becomes harder, or, as is commonly said, the clay becomes 
 stiffer, and generally runs into what is called hnrd-pan. 
 This, in its natural compact state, admits neither heat, air 
 nor moisture, to much extent; all of which are indispensa- 
 ble agents to the production of vegetable life. When the 
 earth is rendered /riVfi/e to a point at, or near this harder 
 substance, the water from the surface penetrates thus far 
 and there remains : the roots, too, in seeking moisture and 
 nourishment, reach the same point and then stop. It must 
 be evident that if this point is near the surface, plants will 
 be liable not only to the injury of standing in a bed of 
 stagnant water, but be subject to the still greater liability of 
 being destroyed by being parched in time of a drought A 
 sudden change from wet to excessive dry weather, upon 
 lands thus cultivated, frequently causes the almost total de- 
 struction of the crops. Fields within my own observation 
 have been thus visited, and I have no doubt from the same 
 cause. For these evils there is a certain remedy. It con- 
 sists in simply breaking up this hard earth by means of the 
 sub-soil plow. Once removed from its bed, it will continue 
 to drain off the water not absorbed in the upper soil, and 
 afford a supply of moisture in dry weather without bQJng 
 disturbed again for years. This affords the cheapest and 
 most efficient drains, besides answering the purposes of irri- 
 gation. 

But these, though so highly important, are not the only 
 beneficial results of deep ploughing. Continued cultivation 
 absorbs, or rather exhausts, certain properties of soils which 
 cannot be supplied by the use of the ordinary vegetable 
 manures. The effect of this process of exhaustion depends, 
 of course, upon the depth of the material acted upon. A 
 thin soil will wear out sooner than a deeper one. The de- 
 sign of the sub-soil plow is not to throw out the earth, but 
 simply to break it up in its bed. 

There is, however, a gradual increase in the depth of the 
 of the soil, produced by this practice. The fine and more 
 soluble particles of the richer material above are constantly 
 working down and enriching the loosened earth below ; so 
 that in a short time, the whole becomes a mass of produc- 
 tive matter.
