THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[Jattpaey 

this county except on the bottom lands near the streams), 
 may be much increased with the plough in ordinary use 
 among our farmers. It must, however, be done by judicious 
 management and the application of a knowledge of some of 
 the obvious laws of production. To throw up a mass of cold 
 clay for the first time, in the spring, with the expectation of 
 raising a crop that season, would be as preposterous as to 
 think of maturing a hot-bed plant by exposing it to the 
 chilling winds of March. Yet I have often seen this done, 
 and have caused it to bo done myself, and wondered why 
 nothing grew. The true course to pursue is, at every suc- 
 cessive /rt7Z ploughing, to deepen your furrows « ^iWe / or 
 for some crops, if you have plenty of warm manures, sink 
 them to the full depth desired. This process will, in a short 
 tirne, give you a soil that will wear, and that will not dry up 
 or drown out your crops. So say men who have tried it and 
 who have the aid of science to give additional weight to the 
 testimony of their own observation. The frost in the win- 
 ter will pulverise the soil more perfectly than it can be done 
 in the same time by any artificial process. 

Did you ever think that by shallow plowing you were 
 shijnminrj the land ; and in a little while you would have all 
 the cream tahen off, and what was left would look blue ? 
 How long do you suppose land will produce with three 
 inches depth of cultivation ? — and how much more than that 
 will be the average in this county ? Some, I hope ; too lit- 
 tle, I fear. 

When farmers can be made to understand that the earth 
 which they cultivate is as a thing of life ; — that it has respi- 
 ration ; — that it hreathes : and that to produce a healthy and 
 invigorating action, its pores must be kept open — then we 
 may expect a large increase of crops. It is not the size of 
 the mass of earth which surrounds a plant upon which it 
 depends for its degree of nourishment; but it is the state of 
 preparation that the earth is in ; otherwise a solitary tree, 
 placed in the centre of a field of compact clay, might be ex- 
 pected to flourish more luxuriantly than if planted in the 
 fine mould of the door-yard. It is in the finely pulverized 
 soils, so prepared as to admit heat, moisture and air more 
 freely, that we may expect the largest growth of vegetable 
 products. Prepare j'our fields as the homeopathist does his 
 curatives, by pulverization (trituration) ; but be careful to 
 administer no homeopathic doses of fertilizers or of labor. 

POTATO DISEASE. 

The following from the English Gardeners' Chronicle seems 
 to be opposed to the idea entertained by some that the Po- 
 tato is worn out by continuous planting, and can be restored 
 to health and vigor only by introducing new seed from its 
 native soil: 

The following short account of an experiment upon the 
 growth of Potatoes from South America may perhaps prove 
 interesting to some of your readers. It was undertaken with 
 the view of determining the correctness of at least one of the 
 surmises as to the origin of the Potato disease, namely, 
 that our seed was worn out, and that if fresh stock was ob- 
 tained from the country to which it properly belongs, the 
 disease would not be found to attack it. The tubers that I 
 planted came from Peru in a guano ship, and were forward- 
 ed to the Royal Agricultural Society in March, 1851. I was 
 fortunate enough to obtain one or two, which were planted 
 at once in good garden ground ; they came up healthy look- 
 ing plants, and seemed to prosper until the time at which 
 they were raised, in October ; and were found to yield very 
 well, without any appearance of disease having manifested 
 itself, while other Potatoes in their neighborhood had sufi"er- 
 ed considerably. The following year they were again plant- 
 ed under quite as favorable circumstances, but with a very 
 diff'orent result ; the quantity taken up was small, and fully 
 one-third were badly diseased, indeed from about the mid- 
 dle of August it was evident that they had begun to be at- 
 tacked. However, the sound sets having been carefully pre- 

served, were again sown this year with a similar unfavorable 
 result ; the produce has diminished in size, and more than 
 one-third are destroyed. From this we may conclude, I 
 think, that the disease is due to soil or climate, or to local 
 influences rather than to a degeneration of the plant itself, 
 or at a)iy rate than to its being '" worn out" by cultivation ia 
 this country. — 0. H. 0., Fulham. 

THE FERRET. 

Mr. Editor — Sir: As you requested me to give you what 
 little experience I have in rearing the Ferret, I would reply, 
 by saying that I have often wished I could have seen, in 
 your valuable paper, some interesting facts, relative to this 
 useful animal, written by some one who has had more ex- 
 perience than myself. 

I owned a beautiful little female ferret in England, '^ Jien 
 I was about sixteen years of ago, and used to amuse mj^self 
 by exercising it about my father's barn and stables, hog 
 pens, Ac, with a faithful dog: and was much pleased with 
 its activity in driving rats, and following me about the pre- 
 mises, which it would do invariably until it came in scent of 
 the hen-roost or of some game. Its nature is such that the 
 moment it gets scent of game, it will immediately follow the 
 track. She got so well acquainted with the premises that I 
 left her in the barn one winter day, while I went to shoot 
 ducks. When I came home at night I had forgotten all 
 about my Ferret. The housekeeper questioned me, in a 
 joking manner, about her. I feared she was lost ; but she 
 soon relieved my fears by informing me that she came home 
 in the evening with a robin red breast in her mouth, and re- 
 tired to her box. 

I believe the Ferret to be a native of Africa ; of a whitish 
 color, and red eyes. They are much used in England for 
 ferreting out rats, which are killed generally by well train- 
 ed terrier dogs, or some other good kind of dog. They are 
 also profitably used for the purpose of driving out rabbits 
 from their burrows into nets fur market ; — vast quanti- 
 ties being obtained in this manner. Whilst in this business, 
 there has been occasionally a stray Ferret left behind, and 
 have been found again, when a female, crossed with the 
 English Fitchew, which accounts for the different colors 
 which they now assume ; and are much hardier, and smarter 
 for hunting the rat. 

Understanding that there was probably a million dollars 
 worth of property destroyed annually in Ohio by rats, about 
 seven years ago I took considerable pains to introduce Fer- 
 rets into this country. Since that time I have kept and 
 propagated them, and have now five for sale, four males and 
 one female. Their food has been, principally, coarse, sweet 
 bread and sweet milk ; occasionally a little fresh meat, 
 when I had any, mice, &c., making a point of feeding them 
 a little fresh water daily. They are very fond of their milk, 
 and I have known them to leave any thing else to get it. I 
 have been careful to feed them twice a day, and to see that 
 they left no food. If they did, I gave them less; or if they 
 got too fat, to lessen their feed. In winter or cold weather 
 I always take the chill off the milk in a tin cup. They 
 should have a good, clean bed of straw, with pure air, and 
 be kept in a shady place in summer, and in a temperate or 
 mild and dry situation in winter. 

The Ferret is an animal that will require to be shut up, on 
 account of its disposition to follow its prey ; it i^eing, in this 
 respect, similar to the weasel. It is a great enemy to the rat; 
 consequently, when the premises are clear of game, it would 
 be apt to wander off after it to some other place. They dif- 
 fer somewhat in their dispositions, like other animals. — 
 They are naturally blood-thirsty ; yet generally affectionate 
 to their keeper. They are very neat in their habits, always 
 choosing a remote corner for their evacuations ; so that if 
 they smell bad, it is on account of the sloth and negligence 
 of the owner. 

I am of opinion that the blood could bo improved by a 
 cross with the mink, or some mountain animal of the same 
 species, which would make them better adapted to this cli- 
 mate. But I shall not choose the weasel, they being so wild 
 and subject to climb, mischievous and difiicult to manage. I • 
 think tliat with a little ingenuity, by the use of nets sur- 
 rounding barns and boxes or traps, to confine or cause the ' 
 rats to secrete for shelter, when driven by the Ferret, a suc- 
 cessful crusade could be made against the increase of the 
 rat. 

I have found it necessary to keep the males apart, partic- 
 ularly about the beginning of February and afterwards, in
