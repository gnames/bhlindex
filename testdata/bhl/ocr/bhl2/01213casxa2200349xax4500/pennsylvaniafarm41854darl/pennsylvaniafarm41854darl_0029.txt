Periods of Gestation in. Domestic Animals. 
 It is frequently very important for farmers to know 

how long the different domebiic animals go with yomig. 

The following table is believed to be very nearly exact: 

Mares, 11 months.

The Sod and Subsoil Plow 

One of these plows, from the warehouse of Ruggles, 
 Nourse, Mason & Co., of Boston, was in operation on 
 the farm of H. F. French of Exeter, last Monday. Many 
 of our best farmers were present, and with one voice pro- 
 nounced it a decided improvement on any breaking up 
 plow they had ever seen. It is the same implement known 
 in many places as "the ilichigan Double Plotv." It is 
 like an ordinary sward plow, with another smaller plow 
 set in the beam, forward of the larger. The forward 
 plow cuts a shallow furrow, turning the sod merely, while 
 the other turns tlie rest of the furrow upon the inverted 
 sod. Both plows may be guaged to any desired depth. 
 Upon Mr. French's land, a sandy loam, the forward plow 
 tuimed four inches, and the large plow seven inches, ma- 
 king a clear fiu-row of fully eleven inches in depth, and 
 fifteen inches in width, by repeated measm-ement. The 
 land when plowed had the appearance of finely pulveri- 
 zed old ground, no vestige of sward or grass roots being 
 visible. It is found that no greater strength is required 
 to draw the double plow, than the common plow, the 
 splitting of the furrow-slice lessening very much the 
 friction upon the raouldboard. Four oxen were abun- 
 dantly sufficient to do the work as above stated. The 
 plow used was the Eagle, No. 35. The advantages of 
 such a plow, in effectually subduing witch grass, in 
 lightening the labor of planting and hoeing, and in turn- 
 ing over the meadows in order to lay them down at once 
 to grass, are obvious from the facts already stated. —

ALDERNEY COW. 

"My Alderney Cow, Europa, is eight years old, was 
 imported from the Island of Jersey, in 1851 ; — she 
 calved in October, about two months after she came into 
 my possession ; the average quantity of milk given by 
 lier the next nine months, was nine quarts per day ; the 
 greatest flow in the same time, was 12 (jiiarts per day ; 
 ber milk has not been kept separate from that of other 
 cows, excepting for the purpose of testing its properties 
 for butter. The first trial was in August, 1851, .about 
 two weeks after she arrived in this Y.-inkcc land, and 
 about two mouths before she calved. I found by thi.-< 

trial, that 4 quarts of her miik would produce a pound 
 of butter. The second trial was in February, 1852; we 
 were then using for the family, three pints per day of 
 her milk, and the balance in seven days produced eight 
 pounds of butter. One more trial was had in the last of 
 October of the same year, and the rcsidt was \Z\ pounds 
 of butter in nine days. She hail at this time given milk 
 over one year, her last calf being more than one year old. 
 She dropped her next calf on the 17th of May, 1853 ; 
 the whole quantity given by her since, I am unable to 
 state. The next trial of her milk for butter was made 
 in May, about two weeks after she calved; in seven 
 days she gave 110 quarts of milk, which yielded 17f 
 pounds of butter. The last trial was had within the last 
 two weeks. Slie gave in nine days 85 quarts of milk, 
 and the yield was lOJ pounds of butter, equal to 12J 
 pounds per week. 

Her keeping through the winter was 2 quarts of corn 
 and cob meal, 1 quart of shorts per daj', and good hay ; 
 in summer good pasturing, with the addition of grain, 
 occasionally, through the drought of July and ^V^gnst 
 last, and 2 quarts of meal per day while we were testing 
 the properties of her milk for butter. She has had no 
 meal at any other time during the summer ; her great- 
 est flow of milk the past summer was 17} quarts per 
 day. Elijah M. PiEed.

Preparing Poultry for Market. 

We have received several letters from Ohio and Indi- 
 ana, asking whether it would pay to send poultry by 
 railroad from the West. That question is easily an- 
 swered. It will pay, if those who raise it will be con- 
 tent with h.alf the retail price in our quotations every 
 week. Freight and commission will consume the other 
 half. The hucksters, those who monopolize all the pre 
 duce, and fix the price to the producer and customer, 
 have no conscience, nor care for aught but large pri- 
 ces. 

"How shall I dress and pack my turkey.", geese, ducks, 
 and chickens, to send to the New York market ?" 

That question is also easily answered. 

Hang your turkeys up by the heels and cut the jugu- 
 lar vein. Pick them dry. Remove the intestines, and" 
 wipe the inside dry. If you use water at all, do it ' T 
 holding the bird by the legs, and letting an assistant 
 pour the water through them. Wipe and hang theu_ ;up 
 in a cool place twelve hours, or till thoroughly dry. 
 Serve geese, ducks, and chickens the same way. Do no-c,, 
 scald tliem, unless you would like to have them spoile-^ 
 Take a box that will hold 250 chickens close packed. 
 Put only 200 in it. The remainder of the space, fill 
 with rye straw — clean rye straw — not chaff. Do not use 
 wheat straw, or oat straw if you can avoid it. You mny 
 use coarse, clean, marsh hay. A v/isp of straw in each 
 bird will be advantageous. Nail up your box tight, anul 
 hoop strong, and mark plainly what is in it, and to whom 
 it is sent. Send only in cold weather. — JV. Y. Tribune. 

Strawberry Question. 
 Having learned through a fru'nu that Mr. Prince, in the 
 Pennxylvnnia Farm JuurnaJ, had cluvllcnged any pert-on to 
 produce a perfect fruit on a pistillate variety of strawberry, 
 without staminato influence, I wish to .«!tate that I have at 
 present a jjlant of lUack Prlncr in a pot, with a truss of (to 
 all appearance) jjerfect fruit. Tiiere ha.s not boon any stam- 
 inate in flower here for some nionths; neither do I suppose 
 there are any in this neighborhood At this particular season. 
 There can he no mistake in this iu.<;tanco, for I observed the 
 flowers closely on their first npiiearnnre, as also on their 
 subsequent development, convinced that the opportunity 
 was one to test the matter fairly, not being a season when 
 strawberries generally flower, so that there could bo no 
 chance of jiollen being introduced from any source. I ex- 
 pect, howevL-r. to find the fruit sccdlc'^s — at least, the seeds 
 imperfe.t. V.'illia.m SAUXDKr.s, Baltimore. — llorticxiltu-
