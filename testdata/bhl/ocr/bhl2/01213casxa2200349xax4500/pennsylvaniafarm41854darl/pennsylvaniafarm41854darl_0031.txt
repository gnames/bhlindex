 Cream. 

A is a Frame Yi^ork of any desirable material. 

B B are two Standards or Supporters bolted or screw- 
 ed firmly to the frame A. 

C is a Tub, slightly conical on shape, containing the 
 Fans or Beaters, and so hung to the tops of the Stand- 
 ards B B, that it may be easily swung into the position 
 represented in Figure 2. 

D D is a Diametrical Bar, across the open end of the 
 Tub and supporting the Fans or Beaters and the Gear. 

E is a Box with inside Gear resting upon the Bar D D.

BUTTER W0EIC3E. 

L L are the Fans or Beaters revoMng in opposite di- 
 rections, one within the other, and meeting at different 
 points in the successive revolutions. 

P is a small apertm-e for the escape of the Butter- 
 milk and watery substances after bringing the Tub into 
 a horizontal position and while working the Butter. 

At each end of the Cross Bar D D, is a Thumb-screw, 
 by means of which the Bar is firmly secured to each side 
 of the Tub. These screws can be instantly removed 
 and the Bar with the Fans and Gearing attached taken 
 out—- leaving the Tub entirely open with nothing to ob- 
 struct or hinder in taking out the Butter and cleaning 
 the Tub. 

It is obvious that the Fans of Beaters, from their con- 
 figuration and from their revolving in opposite directions, 
 must agitate the Cream and bring every portion of it in- 
 to contact with the atmospheric air, more efFectually than 
 can be done by any other process. Consequently the 
 operation of Churning is rendered much shorter and easier 
 than by any other Churn ever invented. 

But fiu-thcrmorc, this Churn mil produce a larger 
 weight of Butter from the same amount of Cream than any 
 other Churn — because the Churning is so thoroiighh/ done 
 that every particle of Butter is extracted and not a drop of 
 the Cream is lost. 

After the Batter has come, place any convenient re- 
 ceptacle under the Frame, and having removed the up- 
 per part of the Cover, gently swing the Tub into the po- 
 sition represented in Figure 2 — in which position all the
