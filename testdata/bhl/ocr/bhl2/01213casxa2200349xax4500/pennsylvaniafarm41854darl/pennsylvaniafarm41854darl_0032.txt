Butter-milk and liquid substances will drain oiF through 
 the aperture P. By this arrangement there is a great 
 saving of trouble and labor in lifting and pouring off the 
 Butter-milk. AVith this Churn one person can do, with 
 the greatest ease, what it would require the aid of sev- 
 eral to do if any other Chm-n were used. 

After draining off the Butter-milk, swing the Tub 
 back to its upright position, sprinkle in the requisite 
 amount of salt, and having replaced the upper part of 
 the Cover, again secure the Tub in a horizontal position. 
 Then turn the Crank as in Churning, and in three min- 
 utes time the whole mass of Butter will be more thor- 
 oughly and beautifully kneaded, rolled and worked, than 
 can possibly be done by hand in any length of time — and 
 the Salt Aviil be more thoroughly and equally diffused 
 through the entire mass, than it ever is or can be by any 
 other process of woi-king Butter. 

By the aid of this Chxirn & Butter Worli£r, a single 

woman can easily do all the Churning and Butter ]Mak- 
 ing of a very large Dairy, and that too uithout touching 
 the Butter with her hands. A few minutes aft^* putting 
 the Cream into the Churn, you can take out the Butter 
 all ready for the Table or the Market — and nice, clean, 
 sweet Butter too — without a particle of Butter-milk or 
 other liquid substance in it, and more compact and firm, 
 less liable to become rancid, and which will command a 
 higher j> rice in market, than Butter made by any other 
 process. 

Such is the testimony of all who have tried this great- 
 est improvement in Churns and Butter Workers — and 
 such we are satisfied all will find it. 

This Churn and r>utter Worker took the first premium 
 at the late annual Hartford County Fair.
