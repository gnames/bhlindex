Heaping, mowing and tliresLing macLines, drills, seed 
 planters, hay, straw and vegetable cutters, plows, culti- 
 vators, harrows, and many other agricultural imple- 
 ments, -were in great abundance. Some of these ma- 
 chines ai-e only a "plague to their inventors," while oth- 
 ers not only eni-ich the patentees, but are of incalculable 
 benefit to the farmers who have spirit and discernment 
 enough to procure them. 

The produce exhibited shows what may be done in 
 this State, and it is believed that in a few years, when 
 the farmers more generally give up their antideluvian 
 mode of culture, and adopt the enlightened system of 
 these exhibitors, that the aggregate value of the real es- 
 tate of Maryland will be increased three or four fold. 

Erie County Agricultural Society, 

AVe have only within a few days received any account 
 of the Exhibition of the above society, and which it now 
 gives us pleasure to advert to. 

It was held in the city of Erie, on the Gth and 7th 
 days of October, being the sixth annual Exhibiton. An 
 address was delivered by Henry Ginrick, Esq., a copy of 
 ■which we should be obliged to raiy of our friends in Erie 
 county to forward us. It is spoken of as very able and 
 appropriate to the occasion. 

The premium list is quite a large one, and the contribu- 
 tions appears to have been not only numerous, but of 
 excellent character in nearly all the different departments. 
 A fine display of Horses, was made from Chatauque 
 county. New York, which the Judges say, for size, foim, 
 muscular power, evidence of good blood and good train- 
 ing, liave seldom been exceeded. Durham, Devon and 
 Hereford cattle, Cotswold, Merino and French Merino 
 sheep, were exhibited in considerable mimber, and the 
 best display of Poultry, of improved breeds, which has 
 yet been made in Erie county. 

A premium was aw.'irded to J. SherwLii for the best 
 specimen of basket willow. 

Agricultural imjilements in great variety also, were on 
 the ground, specimens of AVhcat, Barley, Oats and Corn, 
 Fruit, Flowei-s and Green House Plants, vegetables, ar- 
 ticles of household manufacture, and a large number of 
 miscellaneous articles, representing the mechanical skill 
 and ingenuity of the county. The exhibition on the 
 whole appears to have been highly successful. Judges 
 state the contributions exceeded any previous one, and 
 the most salutary effects are being produced in the county 
 from their annual recurrence. 

Will some of our friends there, please forward us a 
 list of the officers of the Erie county Society, and their 
 post office address.

The large number and great success of the differeut county 
 exhibitions thopastfall, have no doubt stimulated the present 
 efl'ort, and which wo hope will bo followed elsewhere till 
 every county in the State, has its own agricultural society. 

Berkshire, Mass., Agricultural Society. 
 We have received from our friend W. H. Dillingham, 
 of Philadelphia, who has been a constant friend of the 
 Farm Journal, some memorials of the above society, 
 (the parent one in Massachusetts,) dating so far back as 
 1817. In contrast with the present times, they are cu- 
 rious and interesting. In om- ucxt number we shall 
 make some extracts from a letter to our friend Dilling- 
 ham from Thomas Gold, one of their early Presidents, 
 an accomplished scholar and able lawyer, dated in 18l!0. 
 He was the father-in-law of Nathan Appleton, one of 
 the merchant princes of Boston. 

Virginia State Agricultural Society. 

The first annual exhibition was hold the week after that 
 of the Maryland Show, and was attended with the most 
 complete success. The President and several other officers 
 of the Maryland State Societ}^ wore present, who expressed 
 themselves highly gratitied at tho spirit and enthusiasm dis- 
 played. $50,000 wore raised by voluntary sul'scrijitions, 
 during the exhibition, and the Society is thus placed on a 
 solid foundation from the very start. The corporate au- 
 thorities of Richmond subscribed $6000. An address was 
 delivered by Ex-Presidout Tyler, at the close of the Ex- 
 hibition. About 20,000 persons visited the grounds on the 
 third day of the Show, when the Ploughing Match took 
 place, for the prize of $100, (given bv,- Madame Sontag,) 
 and elicited much interest. Madame Soutag was escorted 
 over the ground by AV^ni. Boulware, Esq., late Charge to 
 Naples. The Richmond AVhig says : 

"We have never seen so many people in such good 
 humor. Tho best evidence of the enthusiasm, which 
 pervades the farmers, was tl.e subscription for the benefit 
 of the Society, on Wednesday night, of $30,000. Nume- 
 rous other contributions were made on Thursday, and tho 
 amount will probably be swollen to $50,000. Richmond 
 city subscribed $5,000." — Americari Farmer.

 ure in making some extracts from it in another column.

 Our northern exchanges advise us of the recent death 
 of two distinguished individiials, who have filled a prom- 
 inent position before the agricultural and scientific com- 
 munity, and whose loss has excited general and profound 
 regret. AVe allude to John A. Delafield, lately President
