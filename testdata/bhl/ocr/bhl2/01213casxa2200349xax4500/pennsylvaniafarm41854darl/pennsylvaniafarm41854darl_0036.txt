The urea is the matter from which is formed by fermenta- 
 tion the ammonia which we seek to detain, and Sprengel 
 desiring to ascertain how far water would serve the purpose, 
 left one portion of the same urine pure and another portion 
 mixed with an equal quantity of water; both to stand for a 
 month. The result was as follows: — 

Pure Urine.

 "The addition of water," Sprengel remarks, "has this 
 advantage, that the diluted liquid contains nearly four 
 times" (more than three times) "as much ammonia as urine 
 left to putrefy in its natural state, though it retained only 
 0"4 less urea."'-'' He supposes that a cow produces 15,000 
 lbs. of urine yearly, and that by leaving pure urine in a tank 
 wo should thus lose 162 lbs. of ammonia, which, at Mr. 
 Way's estimate of 6d. per lb., would be a yearly loss of four 
 pounds sterling per cow; and this, too, as compared with the 
 mixed urine. 

The loss of ammonia on the mixed urine is severe, amount- 
 ing in fact to one-fifth. Well may Sprengel say, "Whoever 
 is obliged for want of straw to collect the urine separately, 
 whoever, if compelled to do this, mixes no water with it, or 
 fails also to employ some neutralizing substance to combine 
 with the ammonia suffers a loss of manure which exceeds all 
 belief. lean nowhere find how much water is necessary to save 
 all the ammonia. If much, the application is greatly in- 
 creased; but however much water be used, when we consider 
 how slightly even a heavy shower of rain penetrates dry 
 ground, I cannot but think that much of the ammonia after 
 it has been delivered from the cart must be liable to escape. 
 Besides, if the urine be collected separately upon system, 
 what is to bo done with the straw? It cannot bo used sep- 
 arately as dry manure. Are we to cut it all up into chaff as 
 food for stock? I do this myself, but it may bo done, I 
 think, too largely. There is reason to think, as we have 
 seen, that the good effect of straw in supplying carbon as the 
 substance of crops has been too much overlooked lately. 
 Now it is clear that a large part of the straw eaten by stock 
 is literally consumed by them, and is dissipated like smoke 
 through their nostrils in their breath. According to Block, 
 a sheep fed on 100 lbs. of rye-straw with water voids only 
 40 lbs. of excrements sulid and J} u id, so that more than 
 half the carbon is wasted. The same thing, in fact, happens 
 as in the obsolete Lincolnshire practice of threshing the wheat 
 and burning the straw afterwards in the fields. If our stock 
 eat the straw from 100 acres, we have in fact burnt the pro- 
 duce of 60 acres. It is an excellent practice to give chafi' 
 as food; yet if the manure be applied as proposed in a li- 
 quid form, we might burn too much straw. But there is 
 another of the three great manuring subst.iaices, namely, 
 phosphorus, about which wo have to enquire in judging the 
 propriety of employing liquid manure; and when one sees it 
 stated broadly that modern science has decided in favor of 
 liquid m.anure — when one reads, too, that in a Scotch county 
 iron pipes are laid down over a farm of nearly 400 acres, 
 at a cost of towards 21. per acre, in order to distribute the 
 urine of 150 cattle by hose over the entire surface, — how- 
 ever much one must respect enterprise and ingenuity, it be- 
 comes imperative to examine the philosophy of the arrange- 
 ment. Now, it actually appears by the analysis of Bous- 
 singault and of Von Bibra,f that the urine of the ox and 
 the horse contain none of the phosphorus voided by them, 
 which remains exclusively in their solid dropping. The ar- 
 angement, then, really seems opposed to theory as well as 
 to practice, since an expensive and troublesome apparatus is 
 laid down which not only leaves behind carbon, about which 
 some doubt may exist, but actually forgets another element 
 ■ — phosphorus, known positively to be essential for a princi-

pal crop, that of turnips. It may be possible to amend the 
 plan by mixing the solid droppings with the urine, and force 
 both united through those pipes. It maj' be possible to force 
 this puljiy fluid through a long range of pipes without clog- 
 ging them, though I much doubt it. But even then, I ask, 
 what is to become of the straw? Are we prepared to fore- 
 go all use of it upon laud; and if not, in what form is it to 
 bo applied? When the capital of landlords is so much want- 
 ed for undoubted improvements, it becomes a bounden 
 though ungracious task to warn against what appears to the 
 last degree questionable in science as well as novel in prac- 
 tice. We indeed have little or no experience on the subject; 
 but foreign writers who are best acquainted with li(inid ma- 
 nure seem least enamored with it. We have heard Sprengel, 
 a German and a chemist, who says again, speaking of its Ger- 
 man use as mixed largely with water: "The urine tanks are 
 not such excellent arrangements as they are frequently rep- 
 resented to be, and it is in many cases more profitable to 
 pour the urine over the dung in the dung-pit, or to sup- 
 ply so much that the whole of the urine may be absorb- 
 ed." AVhat says our other great authority, Boussingault 
 a French Chemist and farmer? "He is led to adopt the 
 opinion of Mr. Creed respecting them, viz: that the ad- 
 vantages ascribed to them in Switzerland are exaggera- 
 ted." Lord Spencer, I know, had strong objections to the 
 housing of cattle, except of course the fattening beasts. 
 When he first began farming, as he told me, it was the fashion 
 for every gentlem.an who piqued himself on his farming, to 
 soil his cattle; but he had seen the fashion expire. Sir John 
 Sinclair visited a field of a Mr. Ilarley's, manured by an en- 
 gine with cow-house drainage, which had been mown sixteen 
 times in three years." This statement is, I suppose, forty 
 years old, yet one would think it had been written . yester- 
 day. 

This marvellous effect of liquid manure is not indeed due 
 simply to the use of the liquid. The mere mowing would 
 give more grass, because the feet of animals trampling at 
 liberty while they feed at will, checks the growth of the 
 young grass, and this I believe to be the principal reason 
 why folding of sheep, as already mentioned, should afford, 
 so much more keep than allowing them to range at large. 
 The system seems especially suited for cows kept to supply 
 large towns with milk, but even if the use of liquid manure 
 were as desirable as a general pr.ictice, it seem scarcely suit- 
 ed to the health of young animals. Foreign writers always 
 ascribe its adoption to scarcity of litter. In Switzerland, 
 where it has been longest in use, the straw litter of the 
 cattle is twice a week withdrawn from their beds and wash- 
 ed, and replaced but such a scarcity of straw is certainly 
 not the grievance under which our arable farmers labor. 

It has been proposed as a remedy against the escape of 
 liquor to roof iiver the farmyard. But the straw lying loose 
 would be apt, I think to get fire-fanged, as is now the case 
 with horse litter thrown too thickly into the j^ard during 
 dry weather. In this part of England the dung does not 
 get made even in the open yards when our usual scanty al- 
 allowance of rain at all fails. A roof for the dung-heap has 
 been further also suggested. This may perhaps be required 
 in Lancashire, but I would not venture it here. 

Seeing, then, the lack of a remedy, it may be worth while 
 to inquire into the extent of the disorder; and, first, as to 
 the escape of ammonia. The two remedies which Bous- 
 singault, as a chouist, proposes, are the exclusion of air 
 and moisture. "The daily addition of fresh litter from the 
 stables," he says, speaking, indeed, of the dunghill, but the 
 principle applies ecjually to the yard, "powerfully impedes 
 the escai)o of the volatile elements, protecting the inferior 
 layers from the direct contact of air." The German Thaer, 
 indeed, examined chemically the air collected from the sur- 
 face of dung-heaps, and found little or no escape either of 
 carbon or ammonia. Pressure our farmers provide 
 by the trampling of beasts in the yard, and by driving 
 their carts over the dunghills. With plenty of litter there 
 need be no smell, even in a yard where eighty hogs are 
 being fatted at once, as I have often experienced, but the 
 pleasant scent of fresh wheat straw. Dry hot weather is 
 tho time when most waste occurs; and then it would be 
 • be well, certainlj-, to screw a hose on the pump, and distrib- 
 ute water over the yard: for though chemists differ as to 
 I the changes which farmyard dung undergoes, all agree aa 
 I to tlie utility of water in diminishing the volatility of the 
 ammonia. They agree, that the urea in the first place, is 
 a fixed salt, and that it becomes volatile as ammonia, but 
 in what mode they do not agree. They also agree, which
