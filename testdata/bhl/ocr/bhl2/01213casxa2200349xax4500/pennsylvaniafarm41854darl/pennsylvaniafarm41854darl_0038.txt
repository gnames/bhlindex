Dickey's Patent Butter Worker. 

The subscriber is now prepared to furnish his patent 
 Butter Worker to those engaged in dairying, and prefer 
 good butter with little labor to that not so good with 
 much time spent in its preparation. This has been 
 proven to be a good invention, and one much needed. 
 It is warranted to work one hundred pounds of butter 
 in fifteen minutes, and with extreme ease to the opera- 
 tor, thus making the most arduous part of dairy labor 
 easy, and at the same time improving the butter both 
 in appearance and keeping quality. 

The inventor is a practical dairyman, and after many 
 trials has succeeded in getting wp the present machine, 
 which he thinks fulfils the object for which it is intend- 
 ed in as near a perfect manner as a machine can be 
 made to do. 

He adds a few testimonials from persons who have 
 used it, to whom any may refer. For further particu- 
 lars address the subscriber at Hopewell Cotton Works, 
 Chester county. Pa. E. J. DICKEY. 

The above Butter Worker is for sale at Paschall Mor- 
 ris & Co.'s Agricultural Warehouse, 380 Market rtreet, 
 Philadelphia, sole agents for that city. 

NOTICES. 

Hydropathic Quarterly Review. — AVe have received 
 the first number of this new periodical, devoted to the 
 system of curing disease and preserving health by the 
 aid of water only, in its numerously modified forms, and 
 other natural agencies, without the aid of drugs. It is 
 published by Fowler and Wells of New York. Price $2 
 per year. 

Water cure treatment does not imply water only, as is 
 commonly supposed, but perhaps more properly consists 
 in tlie disuse of drugs. Pure air, light, temperatuie, 
 regvilated diet, and exercise, together with water, are 
 made use of as the chief remedi.al agents, and not as 
 auxiliaries, as in the common practice. In certain 
 chronic diseases of long standing we have known water 
 treatment (so called) to be highly beneficial. The work 
 before us, as well as the other publications on the same 
 subject, are well worth perusal. It is illustrated by nu- 
 merous engravings. 

Warders Westers Horticultural Review. — We are 
 pleased to see this valuable periodical, wliich has been 
 discontinued for a short time, owing to ill health in the 
 Editor, is about being resumed, "refreshed, and with 
 recuperated energies from its state of rest." Jas. W. 
 Ward, Esq., will be the assistant editor, and H. M. Der- 
 by, the leading liublislier of the West, has undertaken its 
 publication, to whom business commimications are to be 
 addressed. The 1st number of the new series will be 
 issued on the 1st of Januarj*. Price three dollars a year 
 in advance. 

Farmer & Planter published monthly at Pendleton, 
 South Carolina, and edited by George Seaborn and J. J. 
 Gilmore. Price .$1 per annum in advance. This is a 
 valuable periodical in quarto form, conducted with abil- 
 ity, and deserves a liberal support, which we hope it re- 
 ceives. There are comparatively but few agricultural 
 papers south of the Potomac to represent the important 
 interests there. Those in existence should be patronized 
 and supported by every farmer and planter. 

American Artisan, a large weekly in quarto form, is 
 published in New York City by John Bullock, 208 
 Broadway. It contains numerous illustrations, and is 
 adapted, as its comprehensive name impoi'ts, to the in- 
 terests of farmers, manufacturers and mechanics. It is 
 well posted up in all domestic and foreign inventions, 
 contains the regular proceedings of the farmers' club of 
 the American Institute, a description of articles at the 
 Crystal Palace, New York, as well as that of London, 
 and a large amount of business and nuscellaneous mat- 
 ter, also a business directory. Whatever other papers a 
 person might take, he would gain by taking the Arti- 
 san. 

Durham Bull, 4th Duke of York. 

We regret to learn that this splendid Bull, purchased 
 at the late Earl Ducie's sale for General Cadwallader, of 
 Philadelphia, for 500 guineas, died on his passage from 
 Liverpool to New York, in the ship "Queen of England." 
 This is really a national loss which cannot be replaced, 
 as he was of the best Durham blood of the Duchess 
 familj', which is now so highly prized. The London 
 Farmers' Magazine said of him : "lie is the beau ideal 
 of bovine excellence. His magnificent size and perfec- 
 tion in every point of excellence, entitle him to be con- 
 sidered the brightest gem of Earl Ducie's herd, and if 
 not the best Bull in existence, he certainly cannot be 
 surpassed." 

The thanks of the whole agricultural conmranity are 
 due to his enterprising purchaser for the effort to secure 
 this bull for the United States, and there will be deep 
 and general reo;ret at his loss. 

Taking the last census as the basis of calculation, 
 there are at this time about six hundred million dollars 
 worth of live stock in the United States. Their value 
 exceeds that of all the manufacturing establishments in 
 the country, and .also exceeds the capital employed in 
 commerce, both inland and foreign. 

Three-fourths of the entire labor and cajiital of the 
 United Stales is employed, either directly or indirectly, 
 in dtrricnltv.rc.
