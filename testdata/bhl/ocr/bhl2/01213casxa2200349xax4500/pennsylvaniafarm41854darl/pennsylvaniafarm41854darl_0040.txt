miles; so apt are men to overlook the treasures around them 
 and beneath thoir very feet. 

The explorations of the head-waters of the Red River, 
 however, have developed the most astonishing deposits of 
 this mineral in the world. 

From analysis we learn that sulphur is a constant and ap- 
 parently necessary constituent of the gluten and albumen of 
 the .several varieties of };rain, and of the legumin, which 
 forms the large.st part of the substance of the pe.a, the bean, 
 the vetch, and of the seeds of other leguminous plants, 
 among which the clovers occupy a very important rank in 
 our husbandry. 

This substance must be obtained from the soil, hence the 
 propriety of applying sulphates to all soils that do not con- 
 tain a sufficiency in thoir combinations. So then wo may 
 assume that, in their general action, the sulphates act in this 
 manner, for very dilute sulphuric acid produces similar ef- 
 fects. 

Sulphates, however, exercise a special or specific action 
 upon vegetation, dependent upon their chemical and also 
 upon their physical properties. 

If taken up into the circulation by plants they must be 
 ."Soluble — now gypsum is soluble in a small degree, say J lb. 
 tto a gallon of pure water, still in a country like ours, blessed 
 •with rains and showers, enough will be dissolved to meet the 
 1 exigency. 

If the soil to which gypsum be applied be deficient in 
 Uime, this substance also performs its part in supplying that 
 .element to vegetation, but this is an expensive and small 
 ^way of applying calcareous manure, although, in conse- 
 iquence cf a deficiency of lime, the application of plaster 
 iwill be followed by more marked benefits. 

The effects of the application of this manure are in some 
 I cases absolutely astonishing — while in other cases its use has 
 I not repaid the trouble and expense of applying it. That it 
 is especially applicable to clover and other legumes is a no- 
 torious fact, its efi'ects being much more remarkable upon 
 these than upon grain and other crops, though upon most 
 vegetables it has been used with the greatest advantage. 
 Lampadries, a German writer of eminence, states that by its 
 ;use the clover crop in Germany has been increased one-third, 
 and consequently the amount of stock kept was in the same 
 proportion. 

The soils benefitted by this manure may be indicated by 
 theory when we know their chemical constitution, but exper- 
 iments systematically conducted are of infinite importance, 
 and as the article is accessible at a reasonable rate all are 
 urged to proceed with trials and report the results. 

The fertilizing power of gypsum has been explained by its 
 action upon ammonia in the atmosphere. 

Kollner thinks the action of gypsum depends upon the 

• power possessed by lime to form with oxygen of the at- 
 mosphere compounds which are favorable to vegetation. 

Ruckcrt considers it food. 

Mwyer and Bromn think it improves the constitution of the 
 : soil, or its physical properties. 

Reil looks upon it as an essential constituent of the 
 ' plant. 

Hediuig calls it the gastric juioe and saliva of plants. 
 Humboldt, Gertaner and Albert Thaer, call it a stimulant 
 ■.to the circulation. 

Chaptal thought it supplied water and carbonic acid to 
 ; plants. 

Davy considered; it an essential constituent of plants, be- 
 « cause it acts only where gypsum is deficient in the soil. 
 •■Others suppose it promotes fermentation in the soil. 

Liehig thinks it valuable by fixing the ammonia of the at- 
 'mosphere. (Refer to book.) 

Braconnot and Sprengel say it supplies the sulphur for the 
 legumin of plants. 

Theoretically, it attracts ammonia from the atmosphere 
 .■and retains it for the use of vegetables — it not only is ab- 
 sorbed as food by certain plants, but it performs chemical 
 ' changes of great importance in the soil, by changing the 
 condition of other elements and bringing them into play 
 ;from an impracticable form. Thus it is said to ''fix" the 
 ammonia — note this "fixing"; is forming a solid and soluble 
 ; substance from a volatile and gaseous one. The ammonia 
 of the atmosphere exists as a volatile substance called car- 
 bonate of ammonia, knoivn as-snZ volatile, this is sifted out 

• of the air by the gentle rainsand brought down to the earth, 
 ibut it is liable to be evaporated and lost, as unfortunately it 
 i±oo often is from the manure heaps, to the great injury of 
 Ijthe farmer and annoyance of those who pass by. Now this 

rain water or dew, charged with ammonia, coming in contact 
 with the gypsum, the sulphuric acid of the plaster unites 
 with the ammonia, while the carbonic acid that was com- 
 bined with the latter unites with the lime and forms carbo- 
 nate of lime — here then we have four substances to feed ♦ 
 plants with instead of two, and the ammonia is fixed, | 

Sulphuric acid to furnish Sulphur. ' 

Carbonic acid to give Carbon. 

Lime to be taken up as Lime. 

Ammonia to furnish Nitrogen and Hydrogen. 

Now all these substances are constituents of plants, hence 
 food, but there are other functions to be performed. The 
 Sulphuric acid decomposes the humus, and dissolves other 
 insoluble parts of the soil, and Ammonia is believed to act a 
 very important part as a solvent by combining with certain 
 substances in such a way that they may bo rendered accept- 
 able to the plants into whose composition they must enter, 
 and in which we find them, though from their insolubility in 
 water we had never before understood how they were taken 
 up by the plants, of these is silica or flint, found especially 
 in grains and grasses. If then Ammonia be an important 
 aid to vegetation, directly, by its decomposition and use as 
 food by the plant, furnishing the important elements, Nitro- 
 gen and Hydrogen, and also indirectly by acting the part of 
 a carrier, let us see what an amount may be fixed by the 
 plaster, that we may judge of its viilue in this way. 100 
 lbs. of plaster will fix, or unite with about 20 lbs. of Ammo- 
 nia, and this consists of ICJ lbs. of Nitrogen, which is known 
 to bo an important constituent of vegetable gluten, that ele- 
 ment of plants which forms the animal muscular fibre, but 
 in the carrying trade it may be that the ammonia is sent 
 back for a new supply after having delivered its first load; 
 it may be used continuously while the formation process re- 
 quires its aid. 

Proper Soils. — J. P. Norton, in his prize essay, speaks 
 very favorably of the use of this substance, and refers to in- 
 stances of poor land having been restored to fertility by its 
 use. Of the truth of this, however, there can be no doubt, 
 as a general proposition, after the oft repeated applications 
 of this manure which are familiar to the public. An impor- 
 tant question arises what soils are to be benefitt«d by its use? 
 Here we find the testimony of authors and farmers much at 
 variance, but certain general data may confidently be as- 
 sumed, as supported both by science and practice, which 
 should always tally with one another, and generally do so 
 when read aright. Soils that contain sulphate of lime in 
 sufiicient quantity will not be benefitted by applying more. 
 Soils that contain too much humus (humic acid) or vegeta- 
 ble mould, it has been suggested should not be treated to a 
 large dose of plaster, lest the changes might result in re- 
 moving the lime and combining the sulphuric acid with 
 other bases to form soluble salts prejudicial to vegetation. 

Some persons find it most efficacious upon dry and gravel- 
 ly soils, others upon heavy and loamy fields, but others fur- 
 nish opposing testimonj' to each class. I imagine the effica- 
 cy of the manure depends much more upon the chemical 
 composition of the soil, than upon its state of disintegration 
 or the prevalence of clay or sand, although from recent de- 
 velopments concerning the action of Ammonia, and discov- 
 eries regarding the power possessed by clay of retaining 
 Ammonia in the same curious manner that has been ob- 
 served in charcoal and other carbonaceous matter, the infer- 
 ence would be that, from the absence of alumina, plaster 
 might be most marked in its eflfects in sandy soils, where its 
 presence would be invaluable in fixing the Ammonia. It is 
 valuable upon limestone soils, as well as in those destitute of 
 this material, but mere lime, where that element is deficient 
 in a soil, may be furnished much more cheaply in the form 
 of carbonate or hydrate of lime (chalk, lime dust, or better, 
 slaked lime). 

In soils quite exhausted, and in which there is very little 
 vegetable matter, this manure will not produce marvels, but 
 even here, if barnyard manure be applied, and green crops 
 be plowed in, the most astonishing eflfects may be pro- 
 duced. 

It has been a matter of complaint, very commonly heard 
 in some places where this manure has been extensively, but 
 injudiciously, employed, that it failed to produce the desired 
 effects after repeated applications, it was very good at first, 
 but now "the land is sick of plaster." This was no doubt 
 true, but shrewd, observing farmers, who continued to find its 
 effects beneficial upon their lands, had invented another say- 
 ing, "plaster has made your fathers rich, and now it makes you 
 poor," this is equally a trneism, but may be explained verj
