satiisfaetorily by observing the history of these plaster sick 
 farms, examining the symptoms, and applying common 
 sense reasoning to the subject. In the first place, no one 
 will pretend to say that plaster contains all the elements of 
 plants, that it can act as their only food; such is clearly not 
 the case, and yet the history will show us that the farmer 
 was unreasonable enough to expect such a result, for he too 
 often carried everything off from his land, making it plaster 
 sick, because he returned nothing to compensate for the loss 
 of other elements removed; whereas, the wise neighbor, who 
 did not place the money from his increased plastered crop, 
 all into ins pocket, but returned a large portion of it to the 
 soil in the shape of abundant manures, was able to go on 
 reaping the benefits to be derived from the application. 

Upon wet soils plaster has generally been found to be of 
 less value than upon those of a dryer and more porous char- 
 acter. 

It may bo mentioned hero that a very general impression 
 prevails that hogs and cattle prefer clover grown under the 
 influence of gypsum, passing the whole length of a field 
 over a fair crop to reach that which had been plastered. 

From a late number of the Pennsylvania F.arm Journal, a 
 periodical of great merit, it appears that a Mr. Alexander 
 has reported an important experiment of its application to 
 corn, from which is deduced the inference that it requires a 
 considerable amount of rain to render its use most benefi- 
 cial. His corn, to which it was .applied very early, before 
 the drought of last summer set in, was much benefitted, and 
 withstood tbe dry weather, but that put on just before the 
 commencement of the drought did not produce its effects 
 until the late rains had supervened. This is confirmation of 
 my favorite view of the efficacy of this manure, that ad- 
 vanced by Liebig, and hence the important deduction of Mr. 
 Alexander, which he has carried out in practice, that it is 
 best to apply the plaster as soon as possible, either broadcast 
 over the planted ground, or directly upon the hill ; indeed 
 he gives the preference to the former mode of application. 
 He prefers, however, in practice to scatter it along the drill 
 over the newly planted seed. 

The substance has been applied at the rate of from 1 
 bushel to 20 bushels per acre — the former amount is prefer- 
 red by many farmers. It is generally sown broadcast upon 
 the young clover just as the foliage is developing itself 
 handsomely, or upon the tender blade of grain crops in the 
 spring, and to yellow corn by strewing a portion over the 
 pallid leaves when the young plants look feeble. The appli- 
 cation is best made when the air is still, and the foliage is 
 moist from dew or rain. To potatoes it has been applied 
 with gi>od effect, and by some it is supposed to have checked 
 or prevented the disease. 5 or 6 bushels per acre have been 
 applied to corn anil potatoes, but the usual amount is from 1 
 to 2 bushels. It is not considered best to renew the appli- 
 cation every ye.ar. 

In the barnyard, however, it should always be used ; in- 
 dependently of its ultimate benefit to land, to which the 
 contents of this mine of farmer's gold is to be applied, here 
 is the place to use gypsum ; and its great efficacy hero is to 
 fix the aunnonia that is constantly escaping under the influ- 
 ence of fermentation and decomposition, flying off into the 
 air to annoy your own and your neighbor's olfactories, and 
 perhaps leaving your own crops to be precipitated upon those 
 of others whom you may not care thus to benefit at your ex- 
 pense. 

In the stable, especially during summer, a sprinkling of 
 gypsum acts charmingly as a deodorizer, or purifier, to the 
 great relief and benefit of both horse and man. In the 
 compost heap — if such a thing exists upon any farm within 
 the limits of Ohio — the presence of this substance is invalu- 
 able, for reasons elsewhere set forth. In the State of New 
 York, one of the model farmers, whose name I do not now 
 recollect, keeps all his cattle tied up and soiled with green 
 food during the summer ; the manure is removed twice a 
 day to covered pits, to which plaster is applied, and the sta- 
 bles are dusted with the gypsum, so that from neither is 
 there any smell or disagreeable emanation. 

WINDOW GARDENING. 

We commend to our female readers the following excel- 
 lent article from the English Gardeners' Chronicle. The 
 extreme kindness in daily or twice daily watering of window 
 plants, we so often observe, is certain death, if not speedily 
 to the plant itself, at least to its healthy growth and fine 

blooming. As observed, "the watering should be copious 
 each time, and allowed to run entirely away," so as to pre- 
 vent the plant from being always saturated. 

There are many who have not the convenience of a green- 
 house, who are, nevertheless, fond of flowers, who spend 
 considerable sums yearly in purchasing plants, and bestow a 
 great deal of pains in attending to them. It is not to bo 
 denied, too, that, after all their endeavors, Iheir plants fre- 
 quently look sickly, and finally die. The blame is often laid 
 at the door of the florist who supplied them for not giving 
 healthy plants, when almost in every instance the fault lies 
 with the buyers. The plants, it is true, which come into the 
 market have generally been under a high state of cultiva- 
 tion. They have been regularly watered, potted in soil ac- 
 cording to their different habits, and grown in pots according 
 to their size. The heat, air, and light, have all been ar- 
 ranged and regulated as the utmost skill and experience 
 could suggest. The transition from all this regularity to the 
 tender mercies of the purchaser is soon felt. Drowning or 
 starving, or neglecting altogether, is no uncommon fate. 
 The pots are taken home, put into pans or saucers, deluged 
 with water, and the water left in the saucers, or they are set 
 in some conspicuous place, and left to their fate. In the 
 first case, the leaves turn yellow and drop, the flowers fall, 
 and in a very short time all that can be seen of them is their 
 naked stems, with little tufts of green on the tops or points 
 of the shoots, which a few days before were in perfection; in 
 the latter case, the plants die with all the leaves and bloom 
 upon them. Nearly all the evils attending plants grown in 
 windows are to be traced to these two causes. I will there- 
 fore attempt to lay down a few general rules, which, if pro- 
 perly attended to, will do away with nearly all the c(im- 
 plaints under this head. 1st. Never water but when the 
 plants actually want it. That is easily known by feeling 
 the soil with the finger, or giving the pot a rap on the sides 
 with the knuckles. While it is moist no water is needed; 
 when it feels dry, then water — which latter will not be of- 
 tener than three times a week in autumn and winter, and 
 every day in spring and summer — giving it copiously every 
 time, and allowing it to run away entirely from the iili:ut,so 
 that the pots may never stand in it. The water used should 
 be either rain or river water. If necessarily from the pump 
 or spring, it ought to stand in the air a day or two before 
 using. 2d. Give plenty of air at ever3' possible opportunity, 
 when the weather is mild, either by having the window up, 
 or by removing the plants outside. If, in warm weather, 
 this is done under a bright sun, the pots will have to be 
 shaded, as the sun upon the sides of the pots would prove 
 injurious to the young roots, and would greatly injure the 
 plant: and if in bloom and exposed to the sun, the flowers 
 would soon fade and drop. .3d. Keep the rooms where the 
 plants are of as uniform a temperature as possible, and the 
 plants themselves as near the window as is convenient, ex- 
 cept in severe weather, when they are better near the middle 
 of the room during the night, 4th. Examine them occasion- 
 ally, to see if the pots are full of roots. If this is tbe case 
 and the plants are worth it, get some good soil, and shift them 
 into pots a size larger; or if not shifted, be more careful in 
 supj)lying water, as they will require more when in this state. 
 In summer, water them frequently over the foliage, but not 
 except they also need it at the roots as well. These maj' be 
 adopted as very general rules, though more absolutely neces- 
 sary for some plants than others, but very good for all. There 
 is a good deal to be considered in buying plants, in making 
 the proper choice; for, however gratifying it may be to have 
 those which look best in full bloom, it is most satisfactory to 
 have those which last longest in perfection, especially those 
 which have a succession of bloom, and whose foliage is inter- 
 esting when the bloom is gone. This rule may be deviated 
 from in behalf of Tulips, Crocuses, Hyacinths, and other 
 bulbs, which are valuable when little else is in flower. These 
 will also bloom in the darkest streets of our cities. They 
 ought to be ])urcliased either in the beginning of this month, 
 when the roots are dry for planting yourselves, or in pots 
 when they are beginning to grow; for if delayed till they are 
 in bloom, nine-tenths of their value is lost, because they are 
 interesting in every stage of their growth, from the first for- 
 mation of the leaves to the perfection of the flower. Every 
 day of development has its charm: and therefore they ought 
 to be possessed from the first. If in pots, all these require a 
 plentiful supply of water when in a growing state; and if kept 
 cool after .>;howing flower, their season of blooming is pro- 
 longed. — H.
