process have been in action for some time, and consequently 
 is iui tflf <t, and not the cause of the disease. 

4. That the blight has been in some measure produced by 
 the long-continued and indiscriminate use of animal nitro- 
 genous manure, which has over stimulated the potatoe plant 
 and has thus rendered it more susceptible of disease, and has 
 in fact, produced the same effect upon it that alcoholic drinks 
 when taken in excess, do on the human system ; that is to 
 say, it has injured the stamina of the plant, and rendered the 
 organism more readily affected by atmospheric and other in- 
 fluences. 

5. That animal or highly nitrogenous organic manures 
 should be used with great caution in the cultivation of the 
 potatoe, and indeed in that of all root crops ; the best man- 
 ure for the potatoe plant being the inorganic compounds, 
 such for instance, as those which are, or were at one time 
 used in some parts of the continent. 

6. That the disease having once established itself, has be- 
 come epidemic. 

7. That it is contagious, if not infectious. 

8. That the only mode of eradicating it is to restore the ori- 
 ginal constitution of the plant. 

9. That this desirable result can be only brought about by 
 introducing a complete alteration in the mode of cultivation 
 that is adopted. 

10. That the changes in question should conisist,— Ist, in 
 thoroughly drying the seed potatoes, by the process now fol- 
 lowed in some parts of Germany ; 2ndly, in steeping them 
 for a short time in a dilute solution of the sulphate of copper 
 (blue vitriol or blue stone) of about the same strength as that 
 used for "pickling" wheat ; .3dly.' in planting them in poor 
 well drained land ; 4th, and lastly, in substituting for the 
 farm yard manure, ifcc, now employed, some inorganic com- 
 post similar to those before alluded to. 

In conclusion, I would suggest that the following simple 
 experiment should be tried in storing the potatoe crop dur- 
 ing the present season : — Lot the tubers be stored in the 
 usual way, but in the centre of each heap or sackful let there 
 be placed a quantity of unslacked lime, not in usual contact 
 with the roots, but enclosed in some porous vessel — an old 
 wicker basket, for instance — and covered over with and sur- 
 rounded, by a thick layer of straw or hay. By this means 
 the tubers will be kept dry; and as the presence of humidi- 
 ty in the air is a .great incentive to putrefactive decomposi- 
 tion, one of the main causes of decay will be removed. The 
 lime, so soon as it has become slacked may bo taken away 
 and employed as manure ; and, if practicable, should be re- 
 placed with fresh lime. The experiment I have described, 
 it must be remembered, can be easily tried, and would cost 
 but little even if carried out on a large scale; it cannot be 
 productive of any injurious consequences, and will be doubt- 
 less attended with beneficial results." 

The manure recommended here is that of plaster and such 
 like substances. The experiments mentioned can easily be 
 made and should be instituteil so as to test them thoroughly. 
 The manner recommended of storing potatoes can be easily 
 tried by our farmers this winter and we hope it will be by 
 many. It can do no harm, and will involve no expense 
 worth mentioning. — Scientific American. 

Walks on Hilly Ground. 

In a season like the present, when heavy drenching rains 
 succeed each other in quick succession, the comfort of a good 
 gravel walk can scarce bo over-rated; it is, therefore, a serious 
 drawback when paths are not good ; and there are many that 
 are not so, owing as much to the injudicious manner in which 
 they have been made, as to the indifferent materials of which 
 they are composed; but there are walks likewise with which 
 in ordinary weather no fault can bo found — but which aft«r 
 heavy rains present a guttered and broken appearance; such 
 walks are those on hill sides when the water is sure to break 
 them up into gullies, more or less deep; now to obviate this 
 defect, many walks are provided with outlets at sides, where 
 the water is caught by an earthenware pipe, which conveys 
 it to some subterranean channel. Now these outlets or eyes 
 as they are called, are, to say the least of them, but clumsoy 
 appurtenances to a walk, and they must be pretty numerous, 
 otherwise the accumulation of water does all the mischief 
 they are intended to remedy. Any plan, therefore, that 
 would bind the walk together, so as to resist the flow of 
 w.ate , without, at the same time, rendering it unpieaeant to 
 walk upon, must be an acquisition, provided it be capable of 
 general application. Now, the following, though possibly 

nothing new, will effect this object: — Pound some good 
 lime (not slack it,) and convey some of it to the damaged 
 walks, then mix it with the gravel in something like the 
 proportion of one part lime to four or five of gravel; a small 
 quantity only ought to be mixed at a time with water and 
 then laid on immediately, beating and smoothing according- 
 ly ; then another (juantity, and so on, until the whole is 
 done; the mass by this means becomes so consolidated that 
 it is years before water can have any effect upon it. The 
 process being in fact what builders call "cementing," and 
 one which I certainly like better than asphalte, besides 
 being so much cheaper; for in districts where lime is plenti- 
 ful and good, it may be used less sparingly, but it is not an 
 expensive aflair at any time, and to those who have been 
 suffering from the efi'ects of thunder showers and other 
 heavy rains I advise a trial of a little of it in the most expo- 
 sed place, and I think I may warrant its answering. — The

Importation of Aldemey Cows. 

Mr. JoH.N A. Tai.ntor, of Hartford, Ct., received per 
 ship Ilelvotius, which arrived at this port from Havre, the 
 29th November, two Alderney cows from the Isle of Jer- 
 sey. They are four years old, and are considered the 
 best of their kind. One is the first premium cow of the 
 Isle of Jersey for the present year, and the other of last 
 year. They cost about $200 each, all expenses included, 
 delivered at Hartford. Although the best of Alderneys 
 are thin and angular in the body, nothing can be liner 
 than their heads, horns, eyes, and limbs ; and if they 
 were bred for a round, fat carcass, they would then lose 
 that quality which makes them so desirable, namely the 
 production of milk as yellow and rich as ordinary cream.

The Family Sitting Room. 

In a recent address before one of the county agricultural 
 societies in Ohio, Prof. Fairchild, of Oberlin, argues the im- 
 portance of comfortable and tasteful dwellings. He jjlaces 
 the kitchen first, and claims that it should be furnished with 
 all possible conveniences for making the necessary household 
 labor easy, and then goes on to say: 

Next in order comes the family sitting room — a place 
 where you and the wife and children may enjoy each others' 
 socictj' and help each other in the right pursuits of life after 
 the labors of the day are over. A home is not a home with- 
 out such arrangements. To eat and sleep is not the chief 
 end of man. Even in reference to the present world there 
 are higher enjoyments of which we are capable, and nobler 
 aspirations which claim our regard. There are social affec- 
 tion which, rightly cultivated, give us more elevated nature 
 and wider range of enjoyment. It is for such a culti- 
 vation and for the attainment of such a hajjpiucss that "God 
 hath set the solitary in families." But this object is. to a 
 great extent, lost without arrangements corresponding to thp 
 end to be secured. There must be time and place for quiet and 
 social intercourse — with books and periodicals and olijects of 
 taste at hand which shall aid in the developcniont of the 
 mind and the heart. The place for these associations is 
 the family sitting room. It is in fact the centre of '.lome, 
 the point to which the wanderer looks back with longing 
 heart when far from his father's house. You supply, then, a 
 a great family necessity, when you j)rovide a comfortable, 
 quiet, tasteful room, with suitable furniture, in all particulars 
 inviting as a gotliering place for your family at home. 

Does any one object that such arrangements are too 
 nice and fanciful for a farmer's house! that it is better to 
 spend the evening before the old-fashioned kitchen fire, where 
 apples can be pared, and hickory nuls cracked, and !;xe- 
 helves whittled, without any fear of <K'trin)ent to Ciirpots and 
 and sofas Allow me to suggest, my friend, that you are the 
 very one that needs that sitting room, with its elevating and 
 humanizing influences. Nut« and apples and ai;e-helvcs are 
 all good in their place ; but you and your children hnvc I'C-irts 
 and minds as well as stomachs. Unbend your back a I'Ule, 
 and look up to the blue heavens above you. The view sliall 
 kindle within you the latent spark of iininortality. Look 
 around upon the brutes that perish, and ackowlcdge th.^ you 
 are not like one of them. Drop your axe-belve, then, anrl de- 
 vote the evening hour to your higher nature. The farmer 
 who finds no use for a sitting room is not the man for Nor- 
 thern Ohio, in the latter half of tije nineteenth century.
