but all of them together. If this turns out to be true, 
 the name will then be appropriate. It was thought that 
 the Philadelphia exhibition would be hard to beat. Bar- 
 num, bowever, is a great manager, and time will show 
 what he can do. 

The national exhibition of cattle is already advertised 
 to take place in September at Springfield, and we shall 
 probably have to record before long a national exhibition 
 of pigs, sheep, &c. Young America is fairly in the field. 

PALMER'S IMPROVED SPIKE THRESHER. 

It is well known to all who are familliar with the or- 
 dinary Spike Threshing Machines, that their use is atten- 
 ded with much danger, and that frequently, serious and 
 oftentimes fatal, accidents happen to those operating with 
 them. Not a single season of harvest passes, but that 
 our attention is arrested, from time to time, by the state- 
 ment of their occurrence; and could a full and correct 
 list be exhibited of all those who are each year severe- 
 ly injured and permanently maimed by accidents result- 
 ing from the use of the Common Spike Thesher, whether 
 caused by the bursting of the cylinder or from the spikes 
 being thrown out by centrifugal power, we believe the 
 record would present such a startling and alarming pic- 
 ture, that few would have the courage longer to use 
 a machine so dangerous. Fortunate, however, would 
 it be for the agricultural world if their use was attended 
 with only such accidents as are marked by severe injury 
 or even by loss of limbs. But every harvest adds to 
 the already large number who have fallen victims to 
 their use, whose lives have been sacrificed by them. 

In our own country their use, though constantly liable 
 to be attended by such serious and fatal consequences, 
 has been left free and unrestrained to all; but in Great 
 Britain, (though we presume the fact may not be gener- 
 ally known to our readers), their use has been prohib- 
 ited by two different Acts of Parliament, and for the 
 single, but sufficient, reason that their use was attended 
 with such a great liability to accident, so often termina- 
 ting in loss of limb and life. 

To guard against and prevent this liability to accident 
 has been long a desideratum, but all efforts made to at- 
 tain such an end have proved either wholly unavailing, 
 or nearly so, until the inventions of Dr. Palmer were 
 conceived and matured, whereby the agi'iculturist may 
 now work his Spike Thresher, freed from the fear of 
 serious injury or of sudden death. 

The foregoing is a perspective view of a Spike Jla- 
 chine, with the before referred-to improvements. 

The improvements by which these great ends are at- 
 tained, are as simple in their nature as they are ef- 
 fective in their result. These improvements consist in 
 a change in the construction (ff the feed-board and cylin- 
 der, and in the addition of a Protective Roller, placed 
 between the operator and the cylinder. 

In the lower part of the feed board an aperture or 
 opening (C) is left, through which stones or any similar 
 foreign substances, which may chance to be held in the 
 straw, are discharged from, and are prevented from be- 
 ing carried into the machine ; and from which result, in 
 the ordinarj' Spike Threshers, not only injury to the 
 machine, but oftentimes accident to the operator. This 
 aperture is so contrived that while it allows all such 

substances freely to pass out of the machine, the easy 
 and rapid entrance of the grain into the thresher is not 
 hindered or interfered with. 

The Cylinder is secured against bursting by means of 
 three strong iron bands encircling it at either end and in 
 the middle, while the spikes are prevented from being 
 thrown out by the centrifugal force, by being deeply in- 
 serted in the staves of the cylinder, and with a heavy, 
 deep cut screw. 

Directly in front of the cylinder, and just above the 
 aperture left in the feed-board, is a Protective Roller 
 (D,) its gudgeons moving on helical springs allow the 
 roller to be elevated so as to accommodate itself to the 
 quantity of feed given, but not sufficiently stiff and rigid 
 to counterbalance the natural weight of the roller. This 
 roller, however, is so contrived that it can be elevated 
 only to a certain distance, sufficiently to permit the 
 free entrance of the grain, but, not so far as to al- 
 low the hand or limbs of the operator to be drawn into 
 the machine. This roller is also of the further use to 
 intercede any spikes or teeth, which may, by any pos- 
 sible accident become broken or thown out, and prevent 
 any accident resulting therefrom. 

These improvements may also, at a small expense, be 
 added to the ordinary Spike Threshers, and and will be 
 furnished to all those who holding such Threshers, de- 
 sire to retain them, and wish to have their use made 
 safe. 

By means of these improvements all liability to acci- 
 dent is removed, while at the same time the machine, 
 from having an increased number of teeth in the cylin- 
 der, will accomplish more work in a given time, and 
 with greater perfection. 

Supply of Guano on the Chincha Islands. 

Admiral Moresby, of the British navy, has lately 
 made a report to his government, containing important 
 information as to the quantity of guano remaining on 
 these Islands. It appears that from the principal island 
 one-third is already removed, while of the first quality 
 there remains about 3,500,000 tons, of the second 1,- 
 500,000 tons, and of inferior about 500,000 tons. On 
 the centre island, there may be about 800,000 tons of 
 first and 700,000 tons of second quality. The southern 
 or smallest island has not yet been worked, but the gu- 
 ano is inferior and has no great depth. The whole 
 quantity remaining is believed not to exceed 8,000,000 
 tons. Admiral Moresby states as the result of his data, 
 in which he s.ays he has confidence, that the islands will 
 be exhausted of Guano in eight or nine j-cars. 

Hollow Horn Disease. 
 A writer in the Boston Cultivator gives the following 
 as the symptoms of, and remedy for, the hollow horn 
 disease : "The symptoms are dropping of the head and 
 ears, lying down, turning the head over the back, to- 
 wards the shoulders, as if pain in the head. Tliis I 
 think is a spinal disease, effecting the brains and horns. 
 Cure â€” Take a large table spoonful of sulphur, and lard 
 sufficient when warm to make it soft like paste, pour it 
 on the top of the head at the root of the horns ; take a 
 shovel or fiat piece of iron, heat it, and hold it over the 
 head so as to heat the paste and warm the top of the 
 head, as much as the beast will bear ; repeat once in two
