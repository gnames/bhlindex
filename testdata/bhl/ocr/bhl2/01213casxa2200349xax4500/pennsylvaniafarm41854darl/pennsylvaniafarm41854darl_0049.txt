 ASPARAGUS. 

Dear Sir : — It is a very long time since I promised 
 you my mite of practical knowledge in aid of your val- 
 uable journal. That "strawberry question" has dragged 
 me so often and so unwillingly before your readers, that 
 I have had no opportunity heretofore of redeeming my 
 promise. A temporary lull in the storm warns me to 
 take the opportunity at once, as I observe that another 
 thunder cloud is rising in the west, and it will, I am 
 sure, be a miracle of mercy if I am not swept away by 
 one of these floods some of these days. It is rather 
 hard, however. No sooner does one quietly compose 
 himself to rest, than the door bell rings, and "Monsieur 
 Tonson comes again" in the pure style of Coleman the 
 younger. 

The best way to grow Asparagus is a "question" with 
 the journals just now. I infer the subject interests. I 
 beg to offer a sketch of my practice. 

In the matter of soil I am not over particular. I only 
 care to avoid extremes of wet or di'y. The best is prob- 
 ably a light sandy loam in a cool situation, but not wet. 
 A strong loam on a bed of brick clay is little inferior. 
 Whatever soil be adopted, a foot in depth of half rotten 
 stable manure should be laid on the surface, and the 
 ground trenched up or loosened at least two feet deep, 
 the manure being thoroughly mixed with it. Early in 
 spring, having a stock of three or strong two year old 
 plants at hand, prepare for planting bj' marking off for 
 beds parallel lines of fovir feet, with two feet between 
 each bed for alleys. In these beds set the plants nine 
 inches from each other in two rows, commencing one 
 foot from the edge of the bed, only just covering the 
 roots with soil. This will give two feet between the 
 rows in the beds, more than is usually allowed ; but my 
 object is to grow it well. After the planting is finished, 
 lay a two inch covering of stable manure over the beds, 
 and take the soil from the alleys three inches deep and 
 throw over the manure. 

I differ from most writers in the after treatment of my 
 beds. I cut the second year from planting, but do not 
 take off "all I can get till the middle of June, then leav- 
 ing and encouragirg all the rest to grow." I leave all 
 I can spare of tho earliest shoots ; and, after it has been 
 a month or so in season, cut off all that comes after- 
 wards, provided I have enough shoots in that time to 
 cover the bed without crowding. The shoots of this 
 season have to form the buds of the next; the more time 
 afforded them to grow, and the less they are crowded, 
 the finer in proportion will the shoots from those eyes 
 be. Attention to this will obviate the necessity of 
 "plucking of flowers or young fruit as fast as they ap- 
 pear ;" a recommendation which will probably share the 
 fate of a similar one made to "pluck off potato blossoms" 
 a few years ago. In the winter treatment of my beds I 
 also have my own notions. As soon as the stalks are 
 ripe they are cut off ; the soil raked from over the roots 

into the alleys till the crowns of the roots are nearly 
 visible, when I place on the beds a layer of manure two 
 inches in thickness, and the soil in the alleys is replaced 
 over this in the spring. This I practice every season, 
 and by it any one without any pretensions to chemical 
 knowledge may have, in any common garden ground, 
 asparagus in abundance, averaging each stalk 2i or 3 
 inches in circumference, which I think any reasonable 
 man ought to be pleased with. Salt is an excellent ma- 
 nure for it in dry, sandy soils ; others it renders wet, 
 stiff, cold, and miserable, in which we might as well try 
 to grow cantaloupes as asparagus. There are tons of 
 salt thrown away every year on asparagus.

"James Gowen's Address and Guenon's System." 
 Mr. Editor: — In your last No. a correspondent who 
 signs himself "Science," takes me to task for having 
 placed Guenon's system in the category of "humbug," 
 and propounds certain questions touching my knowledge 
 of that system, which if I deem worthj' of notice, it is 
 because "The Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agri- 
 culture" is made to appear as voucher for the infallibility 
 of Guenon s discovery — a circumstance much to be re- 
 gretted I think, and one which I deprecated at the time 
 the matter was broached. In order however to qualify 
 the sponsorship assumed by the society, I may, without 
 offence, it is to be hoped, explain the manner in which 
 the Society's name got coupled with the pamphlet in 
 question, and in so doing, I am constrained more by the 
 desire to acquit the Society iu general, as to the respon- 
 sibility seemingly incurred, than to place myself in a 
 proper position in regard to it. It happened thus — An 
 elderly man, by the name of Nefilin, was seen on seve- 
 ral occasions at the Society's room, soliciting some favor 
 or attention on account of his knowledge of Guenon's 
 discovery. He was present at the stated meeting in Dec. 
 1852; I was then President, and in the chair — before ad- 
 journment a motion was made for a committee to inves- 
 tigate Mr. Nefilins version of "Guenon's theory." — I took 
 occasion to express my disapprobation of the proceeding, 
 alledging that the theory was sheer nonsense, and that 
 such was the opinion of every man I had conversed with 
 on the matter whose opinion on such a subject was worth 
 regarding. I further said, that if blindfolded and affor- 
 ded the opportunity to handle, I would undertake to se- 
 lect more of the good milkers out of a herd of cattle than 
 one with eyes open, who professed a knowledge of Guen- 
 on's system could, if he should be restricted solely to 
 the escutcheons or "mirrors." I felt reluctant to ap- 
 point a committee, but said that who ever chose to con- 
 cern themselves in the matter might of course do so, on 
 their own account. At this stage of the proceedings, sev- 
 eral names were called out by the meeting, which as it 
 appears, were taken down by the secretary. The next 
 stated meeting was in January, when my term as 
 President expired, the principal business before the 
 meeting was the election of officers; pending the meet- 
 ing it was stated by a member, that the committee on 
 Guenon's system had prepared a report, when without 
 the report having been read, a motion was made that the 
 committee have authority to give such direction to the
