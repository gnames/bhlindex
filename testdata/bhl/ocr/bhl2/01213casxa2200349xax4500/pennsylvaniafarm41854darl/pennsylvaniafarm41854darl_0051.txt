is made to curve to suit the joints, and to curve and form 
 lines outwards and inwards, &c., to carry off the rain 
 and moisture from tender and delicate parts that require 
 to be sheltered and kept cby. Even the disposition 
 of the hairs near and and around the two spots under 
 the tail, named in the "discovery," though some of them 
 point upwards, have undoubtely their special uses in min- 
 istering to these private parts. That the hair on the strip 
 downwards, under the tail, should be thin and otherwise 
 affected by moisture and warmth of the tail, is a natural 
 consequence of the covering and rubbing by the tail; 
 that those on either side of the tail should curve on 
 either side from the tail, is also natural and proper, 
 for were they thick and coarse pointing inwards they 
 would convey rain and moisture into the strip or space 
 producing discomfort, and interfering with the stretch- 
 ing and creasing, which this part is subjected to while 
 the animal is at rest or walking. The same remark 
 will apply to the hairs inside the thighs on either side 
 of the udder, which should be soft and modified to suit 
 this locality; so of the creases and folds under and along 
 the back of the udder, which open and close as the ud- 
 der distends when filled and emptied, and, that the spa- 
 ces between these folds must be obviously marked, es- 
 pecially on the bottom of the udder, "between the four 
 teats," where the greatest distension takes place when 
 the udder is full, and the largest folds occur when it is 
 empty. 

As to the variety that is perceptible in the form of 
 these strips, cfilled "mirrors," it is natural they should 
 vary, as the size and symmetry of the animals them- 
 selves differ, but indicate nothing, not as much as to the 
 property of the milking of the cows, as the shape and 
 size of their udders, or even the thickness and fineness 
 of their tails. Who has not seen hairless, ill shaped ud- 
 ders carried most awkwardly by great milkers, and well 
 formed udders, with well put on teats, covered with fine 
 soft hair, under bad milkers ? Besides, there are many 
 contingencies that may operate against the uniformity of 
 "mirrors," traceable to causes different from constitu- 
 tional defects, affecting the milking properties of those 
 Tvhich have the misfortune to carry bad escutcheons; for 
 instance, the breadth and narrowness of the tails, the 
 setting of some in advance on the back, causing the 
 ■whip part to fit closer in its place than those that start 
 from the extreme end, which hang more perpendicular, 
 and will make less of a mark or impression than the 
 close fitting ones. Some tails are longer and more 
 bushy than others ; the heat, shade and friction of the 
 long tails will cause the hairs on the back of the udders 
 to exhibit a different appearance from those less covered 
 and interfered with by the short tails. The restlessness 
 of the tails in whipping off flies will also affect the lines 
 of the hairs that mark the "mirrors ;" to these may be 
 added the staleing and excremental discharges of the an- 
 imals, which, if unhealthy, acrid or acid will scald the 
 shute down to the back of the udder — the scouring, 
 when a calf or heifer, will sometimes mark that part, 
 "the mirror," so strangely that it would ever after defy 
 the greatest adept in mirrorism to classify it. I shall 
 mention but one other, cause, though I could suggest 
 many more, of derangement that diversify or disfigure 
 the posteriors of cattle, and that is their being permitted 

to lay in their own filth mitil they are so encased in it 
 that it sticks to them like barnacles to the bottom of a 
 vessel, and when removed carries much of the hair with 
 it, leaving bald places ; the new growth of hair on the 
 places thus denuded is likely to be irregular and different 
 from the original hair, causing marks that will add to the 
 variety of the "mirrors," embracing the system your 
 correspondent, "Science," seems to appreciate so highly. 

If I have failed to account for all the forms set forth 
 in the system of mirrorism, it is because that my ima- 
 gination has so little of the kaleidescope cast in it, that 
 it cannot conjure up at every turn shapes, lines and fig- 
 ures to dazzle and bewilder, and hence I cannot make 
 the same thing appear in transition, now a lyre, then a 
 fork, again a hill, a club, a shield, a wedge or selvage, 
 &c., like the philosophic Polonius, who fancied a thing 
 to be "a weasel," and anon, "very like a whale !" But 
 with all this defect, "I can tell a hawk from a handsaw 
 when the wind is southerly ;" and to prove my acumen I 
 shall attempt to show how a good judge would pro'-eed 
 to find out the properties of a cow. The first part lat 
 would claim his attention would be the head, which ft m 
 the muzzle to the horn is a study — the eye itself, in form 
 and expression, will tell a tale of the utmost importance. 
 If there be one spot above another in the cow entitled 
 to be called the mirrow, it is the eye, for it will reflect in 
 a considerable degree what blood and properties she is 
 endowed with. The neck, the shoulder, arm, brisket 
 and chest will each be duly regarded, thence the ribs, 
 back and loins, handling occasionally as he proceeds. 
 He will then look at tho depth of flank, and in tliat quar- 
 ter note particularly the udder, its shape and flexibility, 
 not forgeting the teats. The very last place a good 
 judge will be found to look at the animal will be in her 
 rear, when there he will take the line of her back, her 
 frame and size, and will perhaps cast a glance at her 
 tail as to how it sits and tapers, but he will never look 
 under the tail, knowing there is nothing there but the 
 two spots that were not placed there to be looked at, but 
 to fulfil certain indispensible functions, in no wise rela- 
 ting to the milking properties of the animal. 

I have tried, Mr. Editor, to treat this matter, to which 
 I was somewhat rudely challenged by your eorrespon- 
 dent "Science," in a manner as free from the ridicule it 
 provoked as I possibly could, and with a view of making 
 my remarks profitable to yoiir readers. It is surprising 
 at this day, such a system of tests as "Guenon's" should 
 find favor with any of them. I have likewise to say 
 that if time will permit I will respond to the strictures 
 I also observed in your last edition on my remarks on 
 the Alderneys. I have in addition a long score to set- 
 tle in relation to lime. Very respectfully, j'ours,

Editors of Farm Journal : — J. K. E.'s communication 
 on the Osier Willow in the December number is of much 
 interest, and it is hoped that he will next (as he promi- 
 ses) let us know the operation of cutting, peeling, &c. 

At the same time I shall be under obligations to that 
 gentlemen to receive some of the best varieties of willow
