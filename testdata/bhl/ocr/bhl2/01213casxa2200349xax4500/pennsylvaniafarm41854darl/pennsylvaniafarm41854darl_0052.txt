for the purpose of planting. I am under the impression 
 that on moist patches of ground on some of our Penn- 
 sylvania farms, nothing more profitable could be raised 
 with less trouble and expense. I am always ready to 
 make experiments so far as my favorite branch of indus- 
 try goes. If Mr. J. K. E. thinks proper to favor me he 
 can send by means of the Philadelphia, Reading and 
 Pottsville Railroad. J. S. KELLER. 

BOOK FAEMING. 

Mr. Editor: — A strong prejudice exists in many 
 parts of the country against agricultural publications, 
 and their teachings are contemputously styled "book 
 farming." Some farmers are so wise in their own eyes, 
 as to believe their system of culture perfect, inasmuch 
 as it is hallowed by time, and the experience of their 
 fathers, grand fathers and great grand fathers from the 
 first settlement of the country. These refuse to read 
 even the agricultural articles in their newspapers, con- 
 sidering it time thrown away. 

I know whole neighborhoods in this county where im- 
 proved stock — save horses — is unknoAvn, — the hogs in 
 highest repute are the slabsided, lop-eared, long legged, 
 race horse breed, and cows are counted first-rate that 
 •will make five pounds of butter a week ; where the old 
 fashioned barshare plow, with its attendant heavy annual 
 blacksmith's bill, is the only one in use ; when the grain 
 drill is looked upon as a yankee — or worse — invention ; 
 where reaping and mowing machines are regarded as 
 chimerical attempts to compass an impossibility ; where 
 even the common scythe is not used, but the first sound 
 that breaks upon the morning of June, are the mower's 
 harvesters sharpening their German scythes, reminding 
 one of the Roman harvesters two thousand years ago. 

The people in these neighboi'hoods arc industrious, 
 they work hard, but seldom get rich. They have little 
 or no labor saving machinery of modern invention, and 
 as a consequence, the amount paid for labor swallows up 
 most of their gains. They do not seem to know that 
 cattle warmly housed, in winter, require much less food 
 than when exposed to the weather. Large portions of 
 their manure is suffered to be washed away, or evapor- 
 ated. In a word, they are many years "behind the 
 times;" and with their present notions and prejudices, 
 they are likely to continue so. 

Nor is this state of things confined to portions of this 
 county. With some modifications, it will apply to dis- 
 tricts of considerable extent, in most counties of this 
 State; and wherever it does apply, I venture the asser- 
 tion, that agricultural publications are comparatively un- 
 known. After long and careful observation, I have been 
 led to believe that, neighborhoods where these periodi- 
 cals are common, are remarkable for the general spirit of 
 improvement and determination to excel, which animates 
 their inhabitants. The land produces better ; and while 
 the people do network harder than in the places above al- 
 luded to, they make more money. This is a general ben- 
 efit. I could give several instances oi special advantage, 
 that I have either known personally, or learned upon 
 good authority ; but rather than extend this communi- 
 to an unreadable length, I will append but two. 

Last winter I prevailed upon a friend whose farm is 
 poor, and indifferently cultivated, to subscribe for the 

Farm Journal. Some time after he called on me to ask my 
 ojjinion of the merits of guano ! He stated that he saw 
 it highly spoken of in the Journal, and that the field he 
 intended to cultivate with corn was very poor, and he 
 could not spare manure for it, as he would want all that 
 for his wheat. I advised him to use it, but as his means 
 were limited and he had but little confidence in its doing 
 much good, he concluded to buy but five hundred pounds. 
 This he put upon two acres of a ten acre field, and cul- 
 tivated the whole field alike. I saw him recently, and 
 he informed me that he thought the corn on the guano 
 part would average forty bushels to, the acre, while he 
 would not get twenty bushels per acre from the remain- 
 der. Now the only additional labor expended on these 
 two acres was the putting on the guano, which added 
 to the cost, and trouble of getting it, would not amount 
 to eighteen dollars. The increase on the two acres was 
 forty bushels — worth thirty dollars — leaving a balance of 
 twelve dollars clear money, on a single crop of two 
 acres. Add to this the increased value of the land, and 
 of the fodder, and, he has a very handsome return in- 
 deed for the money expended, the interest of which will 
 more than pay his subscription to the Journal in all com- 
 ing time. 

The other case I will mention is that of a gentleman 
 engaged in the milk business, who subscribed to the 
 Journal out of compliment to his friend its then publish- 
 er. Col. Spangler, when that gentleman sold the estab- 
 lishment, he concluded, as his business was onlj' keeping 
 cows and selling the milk, it could be of little use to him, 
 and that whenthe time paid for expired, he would stop 
 it. In the mean time, however, an essay on abortion in 
 cows appeared in the Farm Journal. The information 
 derivedfrom this essay, coming as it did very appropos, 
 he considers saved the life of a valuable cow. He deter- 
 mined at once to continue his subscription.

FATTENING POULTRY. 

Mr. Editor : — As Poultry management is now en- 
 gaging considerable attention, and is a source of much 
 profit if rightly attended to, I conclude to drop a few 
 hints from my own experience to your valuable journal. 
 It is by the collection in the Farm Journal of facts and 
 experiments by Pennsylvania farmers, that it can be 
 made available for the greatest amount of good. 

There are two or three general rules in fattening all 
 animals, and which apply to poultry as well as to other 
 stock : 

They must have an ample supply of food. They must 
 be kept in comfortable quarters, where they will not 
 suffer from cold and have to expend their food in sus- 
 taining the animal heat. They must have some variety 
 in their food, and ih^ fattening process after being once 
 begun must be pushed forward as rapidhj as possible, 
 and finally they should be kept quiet and contented. 
 With poultry I find apartments moderately dark promote 
 this latter object. The house should front the south, 
 with sash in front, which can be opened or darkened by 
 shutters on the outside. These shutters between the in- 
 tervals of feeding I keep closed, which promotes their 
 quiet. After feeding at certain intervals during the 
 diiv, they soon retire to their roosts and the digestive
