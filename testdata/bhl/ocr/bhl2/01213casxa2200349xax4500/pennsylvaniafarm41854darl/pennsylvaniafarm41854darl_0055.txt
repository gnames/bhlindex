MEXICAN GUANO. 

We have received from Messrs. S. & M. Pennoek & Co., a 
 sample of Me.xican Giuano they are now receiving and have 
 for sale at their warehouse, in Wilmington, Del. Having no 
 personiil knowledge of the fertilizing properties of this Gu- 
 ano, we can only say, upon the testimony of others, that it 
 was tried pretty extensively, last spring, in the neighbor- 
 hood of Baltimore, and the results wore highly favorable to 
 its reputation. 

The analysis of this Guano by Dr. Higgin.'!, State Agri- 
 cultural Chemist, Maryland, shows that it is very rich in 
 Phosphate of Lime. He therefore recommends the mixing 
 of it with Peruvian, in the proportion of two parts of Mex- 
 ican to one of Peruvian, by which means a cheaper and 
 more efficient manure is procured. The Peruvian Guano 
 ■wanting Phosphate of Lime, and the Mexican wanting Am- 
 monia, it is very evident that both must be materially im- 
 proved by the admixture, whilst the cost is considerably re- 
 duced. 

As the supply of Peruvian Guano for the coming spring 
 trade is likely to prove short of the demand, we don't know 
 that wo can give our Delaware friends better advice than to 
 call at the Messrs. Ponnock's warehouse, and make a trial 
 of the Mexican Guano side by side with the Peruvian, and 
 report the result to the Farm Journal. 

THE PECAN NUT. 

The coiumunication of "W. D.," in our last number, upon 
 the cultivation of the Pecan Nut, has caused many of our 
 readers to wonder why this desirable fruit has been so 
 generally overlooked, as well by amateur cultivators as by 
 those who have an eye, in such matters, to profit and useful- 
 ness. That the Pecan Nut icill come to perfection in this 
 latitude, we have ample evidence now before us in some 
 full grown and perfect nuts from Moses Pennoek, of East 
 Marlborough, in this county. Our friend Pennoek informs 
 us that he planted a nut in his garden in the spring of 1S33. 
 The following spring he transplanted the young tree, then 
 three inches high, with a root much longer than the stem. 
 The first blossoms appeared in the spring of 1S50 ; the fol- 
 lowing year it bloomed more freelj', but no fruit till 1852, 
 when the produce was about 30 nuts, none of which were 
 perfect. The past season the tree yielded some 40 full 
 grown and perfect nuts. 

At this time the tree measures 31 inches in circumference 
 at 6 inches above the ground, and is 29 feet high, which 
 would indicate its growth to be quite as rapid as that of our 
 native hickories. 

As these nuts sell readily in our markets at four to five 
 dollars per bushel, they are certainly worth attending to. 

Cure for Crack in Horses' Hoofs. 

Our friend, Martin Lell, Esij., of llliiir county, sends us 
 the following remedy for hoof crack : 

"When the crack opens and makes the horse lame, take a 
 piece of light hoop iron, si.\ or seven inches long, and punch 
 ■six or eight holes in it, so that three or four may come on 
 each side of the crack, and fit it to the hoof as near the hair 
 a,s the solid p.art of the hoof will permit. Have the oppo- 
 site foot held up by an a.'-sistant, and fiisten the plate to its 
 place in a workmanlike manner, with good screws about 
 three-sixteenths of nn inch in length. The holes for the 
 screws should be made in the hoof with a small sprigging 
 awl. If properly done the horse can bo either ridden or 
 worked without limping. But to make the cure perfect, 
 a sore must be made at the top of the hoof where the hair 
 commences, which may be done with an inch chisel, guard- 
 ed so as not to cut too deep. A little poke root or souiething 
 4 

else should bo inserted in the wound to make a sore and it is 
 done. I have seen the plate remain on two or three months, 
 and know from experience that it is much preferable to any 
 other mode I have ever seen tried where the horse has to bo 
 used." 

CORN AND COB MEAL. 

In Chester county many farmers attach considerable value 
 to the cobs of Indian corn for grinding with the grain, and 
 feeding to cattle, but we observe in many places they are 
 rejected as worthless, and used for kindling fires or thrown 
 away to rot. We think, however, the use of them for feed 
 is gaining ground, and, with the present prices of grain, it 
 is of importance to h.ave the question settled, what theii- 
 real value is, if any. Prudent economy requires every 
 source of profit to be made use of, and farmers are not tho 
 men to reject any if they know it. We shall be pleased to 
 have any experiments in feeding corn cobs, from any of our 
 readers, communicated for the Farm Journal. There are 
 two ways in which corn cobs njay be useful : first, directly, 
 by any nutritive property they contain, and, secondly, in 
 connection with corn, oats, or other concentrated food, by 
 acting mechanically in producing the necessary distension 
 of the stomach, and thus promoting easy digestion. 

It should bo recollected that food varies much in its na- 
 ture, and performs different ofiices in the animal economy. 
 Oil goes to form fat; starch, gum, sugar, to support animal 
 heat and respiration; and the nitrogenous compounds, such 
 as gluten, albumen, casein, to convey nourishment and 
 furnish the materials of the living tissue. It must also con- 
 tain of inorganic constituents, phosphate of lime to supply 
 the material of the bones, and saline substances which 
 abound in tho blood and other fluids. In other words, the 
 food must be of a mixed character, and no kind, however 
 nutritive it may be in some respects, will give growth and 
 vigor to the whole frame, if deficient in the above chemical 
 ingredients. Starch and sugar will never be a substitute for 
 gluten and albumen or the phosphates. In the beautiful 
 economy of nature each performs its own office. 

It is found that 1000 parts of ears of Indian corn, con- 
 tains about 800 lbs. of grain and 200 lbs. of cob, anil 
 analysis has shown these 200 lbs. of cob t<> consist of 134 
 lbs. of sugar and extract, 12'ri lbs. of fibre, 45i lbs. of mat- 
 ter separated from fibre by potash, IJ lbs. of albumen, a 
 small amount of casein, 2.31 lbs. of gum or dextrine, l.S 
 lbs. of resin, and 7.4 lbs. of glutinous matter. The ash of 
 100 parts also j-ields a large per centage of pota.sh, lime, 13 
 per cent, of phosphoric acid, some soda, carbonic ."^nd silicic 
 aeid, &c. It would thus appear that cobs contain very 
 much the same elements of nutrition as groin, but in less 
 quantity and not so concentrated. From their extreme light- 
 ness a large number would be required to convey anj' con- 
 siderable amount of nutriment if fed alone, but apart from 
 their mechanical action, aualj'sis indicates too much vahi& 
 to permit them to be thrown away as worthless. 

11. L. Ellsworth, formerly Commissioner of the Patent 
 Office, made an experiment with cob meal alone, and says 
 hogs will both live and thrive on it if well ground. Ha 
 gives the opinion that 25 lbs. of corn meal, added to one 
 hundred lbs. of cob meal, is more valualde for groxcinQ stock 
 than seventy-five pounds of corn meal alone. 

We have hoard of other experiments where they have been 
 fed to both cattle and horses with great advantage, not by 
 themselves, but in connection with grain, ground corn and 
 oats, to the great saving of the latter and also of haj'. Wo 
 have used corn and cob meal, ground fine, for horses, and 
 kept them in much better condition than with either corn ot ■ 
 oats by themselves.
