close to the line, theu put in the plants one foot apart, fol- 
 low on in this way until the entire row is completed; then 
 remove the lino six or eight inches from the former row, pro- 
 ceed as before, putting the plants also a foot apart; observing 
 to put the plants in this row opposite the intervening space 
 in the other. When the plants are set out, they must be cut 
 down to within three or for four inches of the ground, and

 well worked and clear of weeds and grass.

The following seasonable remai'ks from an esteemed 
 correspondent will meet with a hcai'ty i-esponse from the 
 fiiir readei's of the Journal. In case it should be over- 
 looked by the male part of the family, we advise the 
 ladies to read it to them : 

SHEEP SKIN MATS 

Are prepared by taking a fresh skin, stretch it (wool 
 side down) on a board, tacking it carefully round the 
 edges, then take equ.al parts of fine salt and alum, pow- 
 dered and thoroughly mixed — rub the skin three times 
 well with t!ie powder, leaving 12 hours or more between 
 each time — keep it out of the sun, but in the air. 

AVhile on the subject of mats allow me to remark there 
 are few farmers who do not feel a decided choice in hav- 
 ing clean houses, yards, &c.; and also in having the wo- 
 men about them, especially their wives and their daugh- 
 ters, nice and cleanly in their persons and habits ; but if 
 they expect to be gratified in this respect they must be 
 willing to do their parts. They must liave a proper 
 care to keep plenty of good scrapers and mats about all 
 their outside doors, brick, stone or board walks leading 
 to the barn and out houses, and to avoid the habit of 
 entering the house at any time with dirty shoes ; also 
 whittling or spitting upon the floor and against the 
 walls. Such care should be obsei'vcd, not only for pres- 
 ent comfort, but as a most commendable habit to be 
 transmitted to children and grand children in future 
 generations. 

There is not enough of tender regard to the feelings 
 of our wives and daughters on these accounts. In trav- 
 elling recently to the west, while sitting in the large bar 
 room at Crestline, I observed a man standing in the out- 
 door and leaning with his back against the door frame. 
 When he had occasion to spit, instead of turning his 
 head and spitting out at the door, he turned it the other 
 way and spit upon the floor. Such was the force of 
 habit that he appeared not fully to relish his tobacco 
 unless he spit on the floor. 

The comfort and happiness, and the affection, too, of 
 rural life, is much promoted by care in very little things. 
 A fi-iend of mine, who, in the summer season, was in 
 the habit of sitting near his window to shave, when he 
 was done would throw his shaving paper into the yard. 
 He observed his aflfectionate and dutiful daughter was 
 tried with this, and without complaining would careful- 
 ly gather them up and remove them. He hail too much 
 regard for his daughter to suffer this to continue, and as 
 it was some distance to the kitchen fire, he fell upon the 
 plan of putting his paper hack into tlie cup, so that the 
 servant, when she brought him liot water the following 
 morning or at a future time, could throw the paper into 
 the fire. This may seem a small matter to mention, but 

it is chiefly intended to show in what very small mat- 
 ters a thoughtful man may spare the feelings, and lessen 
 the toil, and strengthen the attachment of wife and chil- 
 dren. There is every probability that if a family of 
 daughters are obliged to submit to slovenly habits du- 
 ring their minority, that they will never acquire those 
 feelings in relation to cleanliness so becoming to their 
 sex, and so admired by all refined society. With these 
 remarks, therefore, I would respectfully encourage our 
 farmers, especially, to provide for the comfort and relief 
 of their wives and daughters, an ample supply of good 
 scrapers and mats at all their oiit doors, and to require 
 of all the family to use them before they enter, and they 
 will find it not long before the habit of cleaning and 
 scraping will become so fixed, that the scrapers and mats 
 will be used whether needed or not. 

I presume there is no mat so cheap for the farmer, 
 considering its durability, as a good lamb skin. 

Taste of Turnips in Butter. 

It will be well for farmers, who are feeding roots to 
 their cows through the winter, to remember that any un- 
 pleasant taste may be avoided by milking them always 
 previously to feeding the roots. We have also known the 
 taste of garlic to be entirely avoided by turning the cows 
 out of the field containing it a few hours previous to 
 milking, say at noon. They may be pastured on fields 
 abounding in it in first half of the day, after being milk- 
 ed, with impunity. 

Devon Bull FayasM. 
 We hope ere long to be able to present our readers 
 with a likeness of this bull, bred by A. Bidermann, Esq., 
 of New Castle county, Delaware, and owned by C. Har- 
 vey, Esq., of Delaware county. He is about two j'ears 
 and nine months old, and was selected by Mr. Harvey 
 on account of his superior "marks." Mr. H. informs 
 us that when he first saw him he determined to purchase 
 him "at any price." His escutcheon is a curve line of 
 the first class, Avith a very heavy coating of yellow dan- 
 druff on the skin. His dam' and grand dam are supe- 
 rior butter cows. Farmei's in the vicinity desirous of 
 raising good milkers should avail themselves of the op- 
 portunity. 

Markets, cost of Fruit. 
 It would be a very interesting in(iuiry to ascertain the ac- 
 tual amount of money paid out by the people of the I'nited 
 States for fruit, in those regions where jilanting and cultiva- 
 tion woidd bo the only requisites for a plentiful supply at all 
 times, and a surplus for market. And it would also be worth 
 while, during this investigation, to make a careful estimate 
 of the amount that would be likely to he used, if all could 
 obtain cheaply in market, or by their own raising, whatever 
 the.v might need — would it not be twenty fold at least the 
 present (juantity? In a single new State, (Wisconsin,) pos- 
 sessing cuinpiiratively a small population, and whose people 
 do not probably feel disposed t<> jiiiy heavy sums of money 
 for luxuries, it is estimated by F. K. Pha:nix of that State, 
 a gentleman very competent to the ta^k, th«t "the dirfict ta.x, 
 self imposed, ff>r greiMi and dried fruit, cannot be less an- 
 nually, than .$;iOO,()(lO. wliich even then jirdcures not une- 
 twcntiffh part of a sujiply." AVe hear eonlinucd predictions 
 of a glutted market of fiuit — /(//t'li. we ask cinpiiiiticaily, v.-ill 
 it come? At the present rate, with the millions ol trees set 
 out annually, it seems on the contrary, to be constiuitly re- 
 ceding from us, the supply increasing uclunlly less than the 
 still more ni)iidly incri'a>ing and enormous d<,ni;.iid in every 
 direction. — Albimi/ CuUivp.toi:
