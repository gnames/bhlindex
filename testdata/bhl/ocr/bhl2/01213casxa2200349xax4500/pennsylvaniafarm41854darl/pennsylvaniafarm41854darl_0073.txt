Allen's Improved Mowing MaoMne, Patented Nov. 8, 1853. 

The above machine is similar in many respecU to Ketch- 
 um's Mowing Machine, and from its simplicitj' and cheap- 
 ness is believed to be one of the best and mosi efficient 
 implements now out. Among its advantages are, the 
 easy draught for the team and not being liable to choke or 
 clog, and facility for running over the fields, or road as 
 well as a common horso cart. The side wheel and jointed 
 axle, and spring, save the necessity of loading when moved, 
 and allow the machine to vibr.'.te to suit uneven ground. 

The cutters need but little grinding, sixty acres having 
 been cut with it in the best manner, without grinding. This 
 is principally owing to the stationary blade, which the vi- 
 brating blades work against. 

Some of Allen's Mowers have mowed two to throe hun- 
 dred acres, without a wheel having given way or a cog be- 
 ing broken so far as heard from. 

One of the machines can be seen at Paschall Morris & 
 Go's. Agricultural Warehouse, and Seed Store, north east 
 corner of 7th and Market sts., Philadelphia, who are agents 
 for the sale of them.
