large, three and five-eij^hths inches long, by three and five- 
 eighths broad; /orm, (thlong-trunuate; color, rod in Ftripes, 
 with occasionally, russet markings; stem, half an inch long, 
 sometimes very thick and fleshy, often rather slender with a 
 fleshy appendage one side, inserted in a narrow, not very deep 
 cavity; cah/.r, medium, partially reflexed, set in arather shal- 
 low, plaited basin; need, small, dark brown, ovate , eo)-c large; 
 fe^h, rather dry and mealy, perhaps from being over-rii)e; 
 flavor, pleasant: qualiti/ '•f/ood." This variety is unknown 
 to us. Whether it is of Western origin, or an Eastern kind 
 so altered by the soil and climnte of the West as not to 
 be recognized by us, we arc unable to say. The forthcom- 
 ing pomologieal work of F. R. Elliott, Esq., which wo are 
 anxiously looking for, will no donbt furnish us with much 
 valuable information respecting the fruits of the West, and 
 relieve us of no little of the uncertainty and perplexity that 
 now embarrass us. 

From Dr. James S. Biimne;/, Fishkill Landing, Duchess 
 county. New York — A Penr and two rarieties of Apples. 

1. The Pear resembles the Martin Sec, and is probably 
 that variety. Formerly the Martin Sec was much esteemed 
 for drying and other culinary uses, but is now seldom cul- 
 tivated. 

2. Bueh Favorite, sometimes called Spotted or Grey Pip- 
 pin, grown by Dr. Rumsey from a seiou obtained in Albany. 
 Size, full medium, two and a half inches long by three and 
 one-eighth broad : /or;ii, roundish, color, greenish yellow, 
 with a faint fawn cheek; stem, three-fourths of an inch long, 
 and slender, inserted in a deep, accuminato, russeted cavity: 
 tabjx. medium, set in a deep, moderately wide, furrowed ba- 
 sin ; fiesh, a little tough owingprobably to the specimen being 
 a. little shrivelled: //aro?', partakes somewhat of that of the 
 Newtown Pippin, though in an inferior degree; qunlity 
 *'fjfood." The shrivelled comlition of the fruit may have 
 caused us to give this variety less merit than it deserves. 

3. An exceed iiKjli) beautiful Apple, grown by H. W. Sar- 
 gent, Esq., Wodenethe, Fishkill Landing. Size, large, three 
 inches long by three and .a half in width -.form, broadly con- 
 ical, obscurely ribbed: color, waxen yellow, with a brilliant 
 vermilion cheek; stem, three-fourths of an inch long, and 
 slender, inserted in a wide, deep cavity; cali/.r, small, closed, 
 set in a narrow, ratherdeep, furrowed basin; core, largo; seed. 
 light brown, very small, roundish, terminating abruptly in 
 an acute point -.flesh, pale yellow, fine texture, tender mod- 
 erately juicy ;^ai'dr, mild and pleasant: qiLalitif "very fjood." 
 The tree which bore this fruit is small, has just come into 
 bearing, and is supposed to be some known kind. It is not 
 the White Callville. The fruit bears a considerable resem- 
 blance to the Belmont, which, however is rarely so conical. 
 If some friend would have the kindness to send us spoei- 
 mens of the Belmont, we might, possibly, be able to do'-ide 
 whether it is identical with the kind just described. The 
 seed of the latter are peculiar, few apples of its si/.e have 
 so small ai seed, and still fewer of its form possess seed so 
 short and roundish. Be it what variety it may, its "very 
 good" quality, fine size, handsome, form and lirilliant color- 
 ing, appropriately adapt it to the table, and render it emi- 
 nently worthy of extensive cultivation, if it should succeed 
 as well in other localities as at Wodenethe Scions, we tnist, 
 will be freely disseminated by Mr. Sargent and Dr. Rumsey. 

Bell's Hi/brid. — In noticing this interesting nut in our last 
 report, we stated, from information we had received, that 
 Mr. Joshua Pierce, a skillful nurseryman of Washington, 
 had "succeeded in tiro instances, in (/raftinf/ this rarieti/ of 
 the English Walnnf." Mr. Peirce has since informed us 
 that this statement is partially incorrect. It is true, he suc- 
 ceeded in two instances in grafting the Hybrid not, however, 
 on the English Walnut, but on the Butternut. Scions were 
 inserted, in various ways, by him, on about a dozen stocks 
 of the English Walnut witiiout union taking place in .a sin- 
 gle instance. These stocks having been transplanted once 
 a mcmth previously, may, as he intimates, in some measure 
 account for the failure of the ojjeration. In tlie two cases 
 in which he was successful in working the Hybrid on the 
 Butternut, his mode of grafting dittered from any of those in 
 ordinary use, and requires speci.-il notice. In our preceding 
 report we alluded to the great want of success experienced 
 by horticulturists in grafting the AValnut, and recommen- 
 ded two ways of obviating the difheulty. Mr. Peirce de- 
 serves our cordial thanks for comnnmicating to us a third 
 one, which in his hands has been attended liy ]ironiis- 
 ing result^s. And that we might clearly comprehend it, 
 he very kindly tent to a member of the Committee one 

of the two trees he had successfully worked. His mode, 
 which is a species of inarching or grafting by approach, 
 is performed in the following manner : A portion of the 
 scion, at a point about two-thirds of the distance from its 
 lower end, is p.ared away, well down into the alburnum, twu 
 inches in length; a corresponding portion of the stock, near 
 its crown, is also removed. The scion and the stock, after 
 being both tongued, are to be accurately adjusted, so that 
 Uio inner bark of the two siiall be in exact apposition. 
 He then binds them firmly together, with a strip of bass mat- 
 ting, and applies a covering of grafting clay ; after which 
 the earth is heaped up around it. Bef<irc proceeding to the 
 operation, it is of course necessary to remove the earth from 
 about the root of the stock sufficiently far to enable the 
 hocl of the scion to penetrate some distance below the sur- 
 face. Mr. Peirce thinks he removed the top of the stock at 
 the time the graft was inserted, but suggests the propriety of 
 allowing it to remain until complete union between the scion 
 and the stock is firmly established, and then cutting it off 
 close down to the point of connection. The theoretical ad- 
 viiiitages of the mode of grafting now described, in cases of 
 unusual difficulty, are obvious: and its practical utility is 
 strikingly exemplified in the worked si)ccimen very kindly 
 forwarded to us by Mr. Peirce. Although not entirely novel, 
 the plan had probably never before been resorted to in the 
 case of the Walnut. A proceeding somewhat unalagous has 
 been employed in propagating the Cainelia, in which case, 
 however the heel of the scion is immersed in a vessel of wa- 
 ter, instead of being inserted in the earth. 

Beurre Clair</eau. — This large and valuable new foreign 
 Pear, received froia Hon. B. V. French, was noticed, and an 
 exterior description of it given in our October ad interim 
 report. The specimen, not being sufficiently mature at th:it 
 time for testing, was laid aside, and was not cut till the 9th 
 of December, when it was somewhat shrivelled. We now 
 com]ilete the description commenced in Octolier — Core, un- 
 der medium ; Kecd, dark brown, small for the size of the fruit, 
 elongated, narrow, plump, with a prominent angle at the ob- 
 tuse end; y?es/i, yellow-white, buttery, melting; //«!-or, per- 
 fumed, and delicious; qnalili/ '-Ijest." The Beurre Clairgesiu 
 has been d(-scribed and figured both in the Horticulturist 
 and in Hovcy's JIagazine; and its period of maturity is 
 represeuted to be October and November. The advauce<l 
 sea'-'on of the year, Deceoiber 9th when our specimen was 
 eaten, may have enabled it to develop more completely its 
 fine qnalities. To this or to some other auspicious eircuni-. 
 stiince, may perliaps be attributed the somewhat higher es- 
 timate expressed by us of its quality, than that entertained 
 by some other pomologisfs quite as competent as ourselves 
 to judge of its merits. At any rate, we are fully pursuaded 
 that the specimen examined by us was, in all respects, justly 
 entitled to tho highest grade of excellence. 

From (he Hon. Geo. It'. WooJtrard, Wilkesbarre, Pa. — 
 Blacherrie.s. — Having learned from v:;rious ^ources, that the 
 blackberry grown in the valley of the AVyouiing was of un- 
 usual size, we were anxious to see specimens of the fruit. 
 This, the kind attention of Judge AVoodward, enabled us to 
 do, about sixteen months iigo. Tho specimens then forward- 
 ed to us, though in a dried state, were remarkably large: and 
 wchoped, by plan ting the seed, to obtain varieties still finer but 
 unfortunately none of the see<l vegetsited. The specimens now 
 received were gathered during the summer of the jiresent 
 year at their usual time of ripening, and put into a bottle ofiil- 
 cohol. Thebottlo havingbeenplacedon its side, the cork came 
 out and the alcohtd escaped. The berries, therefore, did not 
 retain their full size, and yet some of them measured one- 
 and one-eighth inches in length. The number of jiips con- 
 tained in each is unusually great: in one berry we counted 
 ll.S, in another l!(j. In form, the fruit resembles thiit of 
 the cultivated high bush variety of Boston. The Blackber- 
 ry is, no doubt, capable of considerable iniiirovemenl in 
 size and quality. With a view of ascertaining to what ex- 
 tent this can be nccomplished by cultivation, by crossing, 
 and by raising seedlings, we are desirous of obtaining some 
 of the most remarkable kinds from different sections of our 
 country. .Judge Woodward has very kir;<lly promised us 
 plants of the one grown in the vicinity id' Wilkesbarre. To 
 Mr. C. M. Hovcy we are already indebted for the Jiouton 
 Improred Hir/h llnsh variety; and to Mr. Wm. K. Prince 
 for tho lt7(/r<, and the i'urshy-knyed. The A'cir Bo- 
 rhelle from Westchester county New York, we have not yet 
 received; will Mr. Dawson ple:ise send us a good-si/.cd 
 plant by express of this variety? The blaekberrj-, like tho
