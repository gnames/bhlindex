From Persifer F. Frazer, of this city, through ,1. J. Van- 
 derkemp. — Seed of the Salmon Berri/, from Bodega, Califor- 
 nia, and dried Raspberries from Sitka, in Russian America, 
 near the fifty-seventh degree of north latitude. More than 

a year ago we learned from a reliable quarter that a Rasp- 
 berry of very large size and fine flavor had boon found 
 growing in California. Repeated attempts were made by us 
 to obtain the variety, without, however, succeeding in ac- 
 complishing our object. We were, therefore, highly gratifi- 
 ed at the unexpected receipt, through Mr. Vanderkemp, not 
 only of the seed of the California Raspberry, but also the 
 dried berries of a variety from the island of Sitka, high up 
 on the Pacific coast, and upwards of nine hundred miles 
 northwest of the mouth of the Columbia river. In an in- 
 teresting letter to one of the committee, Mr. Frazer gives us 
 the following information in regard to them : — "The dried 
 Raspberries in the package marked "Sitka" were brought 
 from the Russian colony of that name on the northwest 
 coast of America, by ray friend .James C. Ward, of San 
 Francisco. He procured them while on a visit there, this 
 last summer, and sent them to me with the hope that the 
 plants might possibly be raised from them. I know nothing 
 of them except that they are the Raspberry of the place. 
 The seeds, in the other package, are those of a large buS'- 
 colorod Raspberry, known in the country as the Salmon 
 Berry. I found it growing, apparently wild, among nettles 
 at Bodega, a small seaport about fifty miles northwest from 
 San Francisco. Bodega is the port of a tract of country, 
 which was (for a length of time proviovis to the taking pos- 
 session of the country by the United States) in the occupa- 
 tion of the Russians, who leased it for the purpose of sup- 
 plying their colonies with grain. The Raspberries were 
 found on the shore of the harbor, under the projection of 
 high cliflfs, which sheltered them from the northwest winds. 
 As they were in the immediate vicinity of the company's 
 warehouses, it is very possible that they had been planted 
 there by the Russians, though I could not perceive any 
 traces of cultivation. They grow, if I recollect aright, on 
 the talus of the cliff's, and so completely mixed in with high 
 nettles that I found it very difficult to procure them. The 
 plants were from five to six feet in height, and the berries of 
 at least twice the volume of the Antwerp, and between a 
 buflf and a salmon color, with a very delicate flavor, which 
 reminded mo of that of our carnation cherries. An attempt 
 was made by General Persifer F. Smith to send the cuttings 
 home, but they died on the passage across the Isthmus of 
 Panama. On speaking on the subject to Mrs. Dr. Rhea 
 Barton, she gave me directions for having the seeds pre- 
 pared, and requested that I would procure some for her. 
 These directions were forwarded to my friend Mr. Ward, 
 and a few days since I received the packages which Mr. 
 Vanderkemp placed in your hands. * * •■■' "•■■ * * 
 In case of success I shall ask for some of the plants for Mrs. 
 Barton, General Persifer F. Smith and Mr. Vanderkemp — 
 the two former are absent from the city, and both desired me 
 to procure the seed for them." The berries from Sitka, 
 though thoroughly dried, were quite large ; we counted the 
 seeds in two of them, and found si.xty-eight in one, and 
 seventy-two in the other.
