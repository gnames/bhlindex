Farmers' Wives in England. 

We copy the following from C. P. Holcomb's address at the 
 exhibition of the Maryland State Agricultural Society : 

As showing the interest English Ladies take in Agricul- 
 ture, I cannot but relate a casual interview I chanced to have 
 with an English lady, in going up in the express train from 
 London to York. Her husband had bought a book at the 
 stand as we wore about starting, and remarked to her that "it 
 was one of her favorite American authors — Hawthorn." I 
 casually observed, "I was pleased to see young American au- 
 thors found admirers with English ladies," when the conver- 
 sation turned on books and authors. But I said to myself 
 pretty soon, "this is a literary lady — jiroliably her husband is 
 an Editor or Reviewer, and she handles the "scissors" for 
 him; at all events I must retreat from this discussion about 
 authors, modern poets, .and poetry. What should a farmer 
 know critically of such things. If I was only in those fields 
 — if the conversation could be made to turn on crops, or cat- 
 tle, then I should feel quite at home." I finally pointed out a 
 field of wheat, and remarked it was very fine. The lady care- 
 fully observing it, said : "Sir, I think it is too thin — a com- 
 mon fault this season, as the seeding was late ; those drills," 
 she added, turning to her husband for his confirmation, "can- 
 not bo more than ten inches apart, and you see, sir, the ground 
 is not completely covered — tvrelve, and even fifteen inches is 
 now preferred for the width of drills, and two bushels of seed 
 to the acre will then entirely cover the ground, on good land, 
 so you can hardly distinguish the drills." 

If the Goddess of Ceres had appeared with her sheaf, or 
 her cornucopi.a, I could not have been taken more by sur- 
 prise. A lady descanting on the width of wheat drilln, and 
 the quantity of seed ! 

"1 will try her again," said I, "this may be a chance shot," 
 and remarked in reference to a field of ploughed ground we 
 ■were passing, that it broke up in great lumps, and could hard- 
 ly be put in good tilth. "We have much clay land like this," 
 she replied, "and formerly it was difKcult to cultivate it in a 
 tillage crop, but since the introduction of Croskill's Patent 
 Clod Crusher, they will make the most beautiful tilth on these 
 lands, and which are now regarded as among our best wheat 
 lands." 

The conversation turned on cattle ; she spoke of the best 
 breeds of cows for the pail, (the A3'rshires and Devons,) told 
 me where the best cheese was made — Cheshire — the best but- 
 ter — Ireland — where the best milk-maids were to be found- 
 Wales. "Oh !" said I, "I was mistaken: this charming, in- 
 telligent woman, acting so natural .and unafi"ected, dressed so 
 neat and so very plain, must be a farmer's wife, and what a 
 help-mate he has in her? She is not an extravagant wife 
 either, not an ornament about her — yes, a single bracelet 
 clasps a fair rounded .arm — -that's all." The train stopped at 
 York, no sooner had my travelling companions stepped upon 
 the platform, than I noticed tliey were surrounded by half a 
 dozen servants — men and women — the men in full livery. It 
 turned out to be Sir John and Lady H. This gentlem.an I 
 learned was one of the largest handed proprietors in Berk- 
 shire, and his lady the daughter of a nobleman, a Peeress in 
 her own right ; but her title added nothing to her, she was a 
 noble woman without it. 

It is a part of our task to excel in Horticulture, in which 
 female taste and skill must aid us. We must embellish our 
 homes ; we must make them sweet and pleasant homes. The 
 brave old oaks must be there ; the spacious lawn with its 
 green sward — and the fruit orchard, and the shrubbery, and 
 the roses, the vines festooned and trained about the walls and 
 balconies — even the birds will think that a sweet home, and 
 will come and sing and make melody, as though they would 
 "teach the art to imitative man." 

Such a home will be entailed to our children, and to their 
 children — not by statute laws of entail, but by a higher law, 
 the law of nature — through the force of sympathy — the asso- 
 ciations of childhood. 

"The Orchard, the Meadow, the deep tangled wild wood, 

And every loved spot which our infancy knew." 
 These will hold them to it — these early memories, which we 
 should take care to deepen with a binding and indissoluble tie. 

The Doom of the Plow. 

The following extraordinary article from the London Times 
 and coming from such a source as Mr. Mechi, at least de- 
 mands silence for a time, until the invention is farly tested: 

Sir: — A calm and rigid investigation and computation, 
 have convinced me that the doom of the plow, as an instru- 
 ment of culture is sealed, and that the rotary forking, or as it 
 is wrongly called, digging machine is the only profitable 
 cultivator. Even with six or eight horses, it is cheaper and 
 infinitely more eflectivo than the plow. . 

Since the trial of implements at my "gathering," I have 
 received from one of our North American colonies, the model 
 of a newly-invented machine, which, by a happy and most 
 simple combination of horse and steam power, will — and I 
 pledge my agricultural reputation for it — not only deeply 
 occupy, and efficiently cultivate and pulverize soil, but at 
 the same time sow the seed and leave all in a finished condi- 
 tion. It will also, by a simple inversion, cut and gather the 
 corn, without any rake or other complication ; while both in 
 cultivation and harvesting its operation will be continuous 
 and without stoppage. 

The inventor and his machine have, by the government of 
 the district been placed under my charge and guidance. I 
 have, therefore, on public grounds, and considering the vast 
 importance of the invention in a national point of view, ad- 
 vised the inventor to grant licences for its manufacture at a 
 very moderate royalty, to the most eminent agricultural im- 
 plement makers in various parts of the kingdom, so that our 
 agriculturists may be secured by competition against monopo- 
 ly or inferiority, while the inventor will benefit in proportion 
 to the appreciating of its merits. I shall call together a 
 meeting of the various implement-makers, and in duo time 
 my practical friends of the old school — who must now con- 
 sider me quite insane — will have an opportunity on my 
 farm of forming their own conclusions. 

1 may venture to state generally that the implement, when 
 completed, will weigh 20 to 25 cwt., will require a pair of 
 horses, and will represent the power of about 8 to 12, or more, 
 real horses. 

1 trust I need hardly say that I shall have no pecuniary 
 interest in this matter. The invention has been duly secured. 
 I am, Sir, your obedient servant, 

J. J. Mechi.

The implement for digging will require one man and a boy 
 only including the management of the steam engine; in reap- 
 ing the same, with the addition of three men to bind as the 
 corn falls into their arms. The men will be carried on the 
 machine. 

A friend at our elbow, who has just read the above, re- 
 minds us of Horace Greeley's declaration on witnessing the 
 operation of the Erricson hot air engine, that "the age of 
 steam has passed." It has not nevertheless. 

Winter Feed of Breeding Ewes. — Until two or three 
 weeks preceding lambing, it is only necessary that breeding 
 ewes, like other store sheep, be kept in good plump ordina- 
 ry condition. Nor are any separate arrangements neces- 
 sary for them, after that period, in a climate where they ob- 
 tain succulent food to provide for a proper secretion of milk. 
 In backward seasons in the north, where the grass does not 
 start prior to the lambing time, careful flock miisters feed 
 their ewes chopped roots, or roots mixed with oat or pea 
 meal. This is, in my judgment, excellent economy. For 
 the effect of the various esculents on the quantity and qual- 
 ity of the milk, see Liebig's Animal Chemistry. — Sheep 
 Hushandry.

A New Manure. — Robert Brj'son, Esq., of Cumber- 
 land county, about eight miles from Ilarrisburg, Pa., 
 has been expeiimentiug for the l.ast ten years to make 
 exhausted tan bai-k available and valuable as manure, 
 besides his magnificent farm, he likewise carries on the 
 tanning business. Finally, after a great deal of expense, 
 and many failures, he has succeeded in discovering a 
 method of producing from the tan an efficient manure, 
 This is his plan: He has his tan wheeled out on a level 
 piece of ground, and levelled oflF two or three feet thick. 
 Over this he spreads a layer of two or three inches of 
 lime, and over that again a strata of tan — then a layer 
 of lime, and so on. He lets the bed so prepared remain 
 for two years ; at the end of that time lie finds a bed of 
 manure, the effects of which upon the land can hardly 
 be surpassed by the richness of its product, and the du- 
 rable fertility which it imparts.
