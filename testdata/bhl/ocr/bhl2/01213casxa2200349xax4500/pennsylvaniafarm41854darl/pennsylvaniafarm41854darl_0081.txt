Prize Essay on the Hereditary Diseases of Horses. 
 By FiNLAY Dun, Jun., V. S., Lecturer on Materia Medica, 

itc, at the Edinburgh Veterinary College. 

We commence in present number another of the very 
 valuable prize essays, from the Journal of the Iloyal 
 Agi'icultural Society of England, several of which have, 
 from time to time, appeared in the Farm Journal. 

When bound with the volume, so as to be convenient 
 for reference, we consider them alone worth the amount 
 of the annual subscription. Farming in Great Britain is 
 as much a science as an art, and has attracted the atten-^ 
 tion of some of her most scientific and cultivated intel- 
 lects. Circumstances not so operative in the United 
 States have compelled them to abandon slothful and ne- 
 gligent culture, and in the raising of crops, no less than 
 in the rearing and treatment of animals, an amount of 
 laborious mental effort and close, long continued observa- 
 tion have been bestowed, which have brought their sys- 
 tems to a high degree of perfection, and resulted in great 
 benefits to the working farmer. From the high price cf 
 land there, enormous rents and taxes, English farmers 
 cannot afford to receive less from the land than good 
 management would make it 3'ield. While "they bleed the 
 soil most freely,'' great care is also taken to give back 
 such supplies as the crops may require. 

The present essay on the "Hereditary Diseases of 
 Horses," will be found equally valuable with any which 
 have preceded it. It will be concluded in our next. A 
 regular veterinary college, for the education of persons 
 skilled in the diseases of domestic animals, was estab- 
 lished near London in 1792. Here they are instructed 
 like the pupils in our medical schools, by a thorough 
 course of reading, lectures and anatomical demonstra- 
 tions. We believe there are no such institutions at pres- 
 ent in the United States, and we havr; consequently had 
 to depend on England for our cattle doctors as well as i 
 cattle. 

Our every day c.vperienco of the production and develop- 
 ment of plants iind animals at once suggest.^ the existenceof 
 the great natural law embodied in the familiar saying, "like 
 produce.'; like.'' In accordance with this law the peculiar 
 properties, characters, and qualities of the parent— whether 
 good or l)iid, healthy or diseased, external or internal — are 
 transmitted to the ofi^pring, or, in a word, are hereditary. 
 To ilUistnito this natural law of hereditary transmission, 
 with especial reference to the disease of horses and cattle, is 
 the object of this report, and, in treating of the subject, wo 
 shall notice — 

I. General hereditary characters, both healthy and dis- 
 eased. 

XL The hereditary diseases of horses. 

III. The heredit^iry diseases of cattle. 

I. Many interesting and valuable facts have been record- 

ed which prove, beyond all doubt, the hereditary tendency 
 of many of the physical, mental, and moral qualities of man. 
 Parents transmit to their children their own — cr, at ail 
 events, similar — external forms, similar intellectual capaci- 
 ties, tciuporamentfl, dispositions, virtues, and vices, as well 
 as similar tendencies to particular diseases. Certain fami- 
 lies are remarkable, during many centuries, for tall ami 
 handsome figures, and for a striking similarity of features; 
 whilst others perpetuate a less perfect form, the peculiar de- 
 formities of the parent reappearing in the children of each 
 successive generation. For example, the thick upper lip of 
 the members of the imperial house of Austria lias been a 
 characteristic of the family for centuries ; and every one is 
 familiar with the curious case of the Yorkshire family with 
 their six fingers and toes, which remarkable conformation 
 has continued for several generations ; and other analogoofl 
 cases are recorded. But the hereditary transmission of ex- 
 ternal form is exemplified, on a more extended scale, by the 
 striking resemblance often observed among the diff'crent in- 
 dividuals of a community or race, even where those are ex- 
 posed to difi"erent external agencies. The cases of the Jews 
 and the Gypsies will suggest themselves to every one as most 
 appo.?ite examples. Although exposed for centuries to the 
 powerfully modifying influences of external circuinstiinc«» 
 of climate, country, association with nations of very differ- 
 ent customs and habits, these remarkable races still retain 
 their identity, and remain distinct and peculiar people. Bnt 
 it is not alone their face or figure that remains unaltere^r 
 their manners, habits, and customs are also uniform and per- 
 manent : a most striking proof of the hereditary transmis- 
 sion of almost every bodily and mental character and quaJ- 
 ity. 

As regards intellectual .ability, it is observed that cert^B 
 races are remarkable for intelligence and aptitude in the ac- 
 quirement of knowledge, and others for stupidity and ntw- 
 rowness of capacity ; that the children of such races, al- 
 though roared and educated with equal care, nhv:«ys .«ho\r 
 much difference in intellectual attainments ; and tliat it is 
 only after educating several generations of the less-gifted 
 race that they attain the natural capacity of the more gift- 
 ed. Both ancient and modern history atford many striking: 
 instances of analogous temperaments and dispositions being 
 transmitted from father to son through many gentrationa-; 
 of some families remarkable during centuries for virtue, 
 honor, and liberality, and of others notorious during an 
 equally long period for every sort of wickedness, vice, aud' 
 oppression. 

But diseases, as well as physical and mental qualities, de- 
 scend from parent to children. Many of the ni<i«t wide- 
 spread and fatal maladies afTecting the human si;l jict are 
 hereditary. Under this category we may include piihiionary 
 consumption, which destroys so many of the inhalMtanta of 
 these islnnds, frequently decimating, and sf'nH"tinn>< con>- 
 plctely sweeping away entire families; scrofula, goi.t. irravel, 
 and rheumatism, wliich, like consumption, occur cliiofly ia 
 predisjiosed subjects, and in the progeny of those who have 
 themselves suffered from them ; most nervous disca.'-cF, es- 
 pecially palsy, epilep.sy, and insanity, which rarely iittAok 
 any individual without also affecting mniiy of the s,;iiie faro- 
 ily ; and many imperfections of the external scnsi'^, as deaf. 
 ness and blindnecs. These are the most comm.m hereditary 
 diseases incident to man ; must of them have iheir analo- 
 gies in the lower animals, in which thiy are also hor^di- 
 (ary.
