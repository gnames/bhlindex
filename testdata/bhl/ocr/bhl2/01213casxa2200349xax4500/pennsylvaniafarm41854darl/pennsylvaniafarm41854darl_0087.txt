always taken great interest in birds, I noticed their progress 
 in nest building. Tliey early finish their nests and lay 
 from one to four eggs; but I never knew one of the first 
 round of nests to produce young birds. At the same time 
 from four to six robins raised families in perfect security on 
 thri fruit and shade trees in the house yard ; the crows well 
 knowing, from woful experience, they were protected by a gun 
 in the hands of one trained to its use. When the season 
 was more advanced, the nests were concealed by the leaves, 
 and poultry eggs and young corn in abundance, a few birds 
 were raised in the orchard. And I observed if a bird only 
 got so far as to commence incubation they were seldom do- 
 Btroyed, one of the old birds being mostly on the watch, 
 raised such an outcry on the appearance of the crow, and 
 collecting all the inhabitants of the orchard to her assistance, 
 attacked him with so much vigor, that the cowardly burglar 
 was glad to make his escape. Aly love for other birds only 
 increases my detestation of the crow, as my admiration of 
 the honey bee only strengthens my dislike to their cowardly 
 destroyer, the wax moth, although they are both beautiful 
 insects, as the former are all birds. 

But this is not all. Naturalists have spoken in terms of 
 admiration of that instinct of squirrels which directs them 
 to bury or plant all their spare nuts, thus continuing and in- 
 creasing our forests, as they never find half their planted 
 treasure. But if they do not the crows do, or at least the 
 greater part of it. I once planted an acre of ground with 
 chesnuts ; they came up and formed two leaves. I planted 
 about a peck of nuts and the crows left but seven trees. 
 They were all taken just as they take corn : just pull up the 
 stalk, and if the nut does not come dig down to it. A mouse 
 or squirrel always digs a hole by the side of the plant, and 
 generally takes the nut without destroying the stalk. 

But some may ask what crows were created for ? I an- 
 swer, perhaps for the same purpose that hawks, weasels, 
 minks and foxes were created : to keep the innocent and 
 useful within proper bounds. And the God of nature may 
 not look with more anger on one of his agents than anoth- 
 er ; the crow's bill, the hawk's claws, the fox's teeth, or the 
 boy's gun. "Pro Bono Publico" may drive away the boys 
 until he thinks he has too many birds, and I will destroy 
 crows, hawks, weasels, and foxes, until I think I have too 
 much corn and poultry. 

But my strongest objection to "Pro Bono Publico's" com- 
 munication is the yoking my much loved and fondly pro- 
 tected friend, the robin, (turdus migratorius,) to that cow- 
 ardly robber and murderer, the crow, (corvus corone.) lie 
 says, "The crow, the black bird and the robin do take up 
 corn." If he ever saw a robin take up corn, "something 
 new under the sun" has "come to pass" in spite of Solomon, 
 for from the creation to the days of P. C P. their food has 
 been caterpillars, worms and berries. Poor robin ! you may 
 well exclaim save me from my friends, and I will try to keep 
 out of gun shot of my enemies." For this very slander, if un- 
 contradicted, would do more for his destruction than all the 
 air lines and other scare crows in the world; for only con- 
 vince most farmers that a V)ird takes up corn, and you maj* 
 preach about the sin and cruelty of destroying it in vain. 

We hear much about farmers studying chemistry, but in 
 my humble opinion a little natural history would be quite as 
 useful. Last spring a friend saw a neighbor's son shooting 
 all the house wrens he could see. On being remonstrated 
 with, he defended himself by saying that they were "the 
 worst birds on corn he ever saw." And to prove it ho took 
 him to some hills of corn that had been partially injured by 
 the field mice, having a small, clean hole by the side of the 
 stock, and as the corn was young a few plants had been 
 pulled up with the grain. It was early in the morning and 

looked fresh, being done in the night, (the mouse seldom 
 quitting his subteranean retreat in the day time.) It wa« 
 near the house, the wren was seen in the vicinity, the real 
 culprit safe in his hole, the poor bird had to suffer ; a yicUm 
 to circumstantial evidence, or rather to gross ignorance. 

I have lived on a farm all my life, and been a, close ob- 
 server of the habits of birds most of the time, but I never 
 saw corn much injured by any of the feathered tribe, ex- 
 cepting barnyard fowls and crows. 

The red-wing starling (swamp black bird) which commits 
 such havock in the Delaware peninsula, is quite harmless in 
 Chester county, though I have known them to injure a fow 
 hills. I have not had to replant more than a few hills since 
 I have used the much abused air lines, although, as I hare 
 already said, small birtls do not stand in the leu«t fear erf. 
 them. V. W. L 

P. S. — In looking over Wilson's description of the crow a 
 few minutes after I sent my communication, I discoTorc«l 
 that I had unaccountably overlooked the following: "In 
 spring when he makes his appearance among the woods and 
 thickets, the whole feathered songsters are instantly alarm- 
 ed, well knowing the depredations and murders he commits 
 on their nests, eggs and young." I am, therefore, hapi)y l« 
 acknowledge that the history of the crow has been written. 
 Wilson's only omission is their destruction of young forest 
 trees, and only mistake accusing them with taking up corn 
 before it vegetates — a strange error for so close an observer 
 of nature, as birds are guided by sight alone. The hog is 
 the only animal with olfactory organs sufficient for such a 

purpose. V. W. L

Ouenon's System and Mr. James Go wen. 

I feel my inability, Mr. Editor, in every way, to wield 
 the pen in opposition to a gentleman of the distinguished 
 attainments of Mr. Gowen, not only of large experience in 
 agricultural matters, but also long accustomed to both 
 speaking and writing for the public. 

I have never attained his position as a skillful breeder of 
 stock, or been able to exhibit such enormous profits, on pa- 
 per, of skillful farm management, as he published some 
 years ago in the Farmers' Cabinet. Neither could I be in- 
 duced to any controversy with him now on any other 
 subject than "Guenon's System of Choosing a Milch Cow." 
 Here I feel at home; have been studying and practising H 
 for the last five years, at great expense and loss of time; 
 have been far and near to see all the good cows I could hear 
 of; and allow me to say I doubt very much whether Mr. 
 Gowen knoica ant/ thiii^ about the system on which he hat, 
 been commenting so severely, and with such unnecessary 
 vulgarity. I am, Mr. Editor, more a. practical man than a 
 deeply read or erudite one. Mr. Gowen, in this particular, 
 has also greatly the advantage of me, but in res)>ect to tii« 
 niodc of argument he has chosen to adopt in relation to Gu- 
 enon's system, I may remark that I have a faint recollection 
 that there once lived a person called Lord Bacon. lie wa« 
 said to be the father of the inductive philosophi/, or reason- 
 ing from facts. Instead of attempting to controvert th« 
 system, because we can't understant its theory, would it not. 
 have been better for Mr. G. to have examined into the exis- 
 tence of the alleged facts in the case. It is said that a skep- 
 tic was once conversing with the celebrated Dr. Parr, and 
 told him "he was not bound to believe any thing bo did n >i 
 understand." Then says the Dr., "your creed will be the 
 shortest of any man I know." Apply Mr. Gowen"? mode of 
 reasoning to Dr. Franklin's experiments on electricity. He 
 proved by the igni«=on "f a spark, in the experiment o*" »he 
 kite, that it and lightning were identical. What manerou
