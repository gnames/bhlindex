THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[March 

We commend the following communication to the at- 
 tention of our readers. The manufacture of "fertili- 
 zers" has become a regular speculation ; a dozen or more 
 kinds are now in the market, and not more than one out 
 of the dozen, perhaps, is worth the labor required to sow 
 it on the land. Unless the farmer believes that 

"The pleasure is as great 

In being cheated as to cheat," — 
 he will do well to purchase no fertilizer that has not 
 been repeatedly tested, and given positive and satisfactory 
 evidence of its real worth. 

CHEATING THE FARMER. 

Mr. Editor : — Under the above caption I wish to 
 make a few remarks for your Journal. There is no class 
 of the community so much imposed upon as the poor 
 farmer. He is looked upon by ever^ variety of sharpers 
 as fair game, and they make game of him with a ven- 
 geance. Merchant, lawyer, doctor and pauper, alike 
 take his money and return him humbug. 

One of the most glaring impositions he has to submit 
 to is from that class of men — I was going to call them 
 something else — who manufacture improved fertilizers, 
 which are in fact a little superphosphate of lime, a good 
 deal of dirt, a good deal of ashes, and a little something 
 to give them a bad smell. They serve to take away the 
 hard earned money of the farmer — excite hopes which 
 are not to be realized iu the coming harvest. I do not 
 wish to make a sweep and denounce all the fertilizers in 
 the market, but I say that the many use the reputation 
 of the few ; some are good but a great many worse than 
 worthless. Some of the latter have come under my own 
 observation. A year ago when Peruvian Guano was not 
 to be had, one of my neighbors heard that a cargo of 
 Chillian guano had just arrived, and a quantity of it was 
 for sale at a neighboring depot ; he hurried ofiF and se- 
 cured what he wanted, and some of his neighbors fol- 
 lowed his example. It was a queer looking article — no 
 one had ever seen any thing like it before — a black, dir- 
 ty looking stuff, and quite heavy ; withall the smell was 
 quite rank enough for a good article. On examination 
 it was discovered to be 66 per cent, common salt, a little 
 guano and the rest dirt. This stuif was sold at $45 per 
 ton. It was sowed with great care, but that was the 
 last of it, and the money too. 

The farmers have no idea of the fraud practised in the 
 article of manures. I may say that hundreds of thou- 
 sands of dollars are taken from them annually for which 
 they receive no return except dirt. 

An article called chemical salts is manufactured in 
 Baltimoi'e, which has been quite extensively used in this 
 part of Chester county. I have used a good deal of it 
 myself, and was the first to introduce it here. My first 
 experiments with it were quite successful ; I was led to 
 believe that it was a first rate article, and recommended 
 it to my neighbors, who have used largely of it with va- 
 rious results, but the chemical salts of '49 are not the 
 salts of '53. Soon after it was introduced the demand 
 exceeded the supply, for it was good; but if it does not 
 contain less ashes and coal dust, the demand will not be 
 hard to supply ere long. Why could not Mr. Chnppell 
 have called the article he manufactured last year "ashes 
 mixed with a little superphosphate of lime ;" then it 
 would have had its right name. 1 know that was its 

composition from two circumstances : 1st. Its gener- 
 al appearance and the quantity of fragments of burnt 
 iron, old nails, &c., found in it. 2d. From the fact that 
 it will volatilize the ammonia of guano. This salts 
 purports to be bones dissolved in sulphuric acid ; be- 
 lieving this to be the case, and knowing that sulphuric 
 acid and its components, or phosphoric acid, would fix 
 the ammonia, I thought salts and guano would make a 
 good mixture for a top dressing for grass, and I had a 
 quantity mixed for that purpose. After it had stood 
 awhile I found that the ammonia was passing off rapidly, 
 and I lost by the experiment. The potash of the ashes 
 done the mischief. It acted as lime does when mixed 
 with guano. 

The adulteration of guano is carried on as extensively 
 as the manufacture of bogus fertilizers, and with as 
 much success. I have been told, and on good authority, 
 that one of the most extensive dealers in guano in Bal- 
 timore is in the habit of taking his guano, which he pur- 
 chases from the agent of the Peruvian government, to a 
 warehouse he has on the Point, there unbags and mixes 
 it with — what? you may well ask what — but he man- 
 ages to make with dii-t and water an increase of one ton 
 in ten, when he rebags it. And he is not alone in his 
 rascality. This is done after the inspection, which is 
 but a farce at best. 

Guano, when it can be had pure, is a good manure, 
 and will repay the outlay, but mixed with superphos- 
 phate of lime it is better, which latter every farmer 
 should manufacture for himself. The mode of manu- 
 facture and my own experience with it, I will give you 
 again. E. V. D.

SOMETHING ABOUT PLOWING. 

Mr. Editor : — It has now become a very common 
 thing with writers whose communications appear in agri- 
 cultural journals, whenever they speak about plowing up 
 ground that has lain with grass, strongly to recommend 
 to the attention of farmers the importance they consider 
 belongs to a deep and thorough plowing. The idea thus 
 promulgated so extensively, it would seem, must be pre- 
 valent ; and it is put forward so confidently, and derived 
 from such high authority, as to give the common people 
 reason to think the matter was fairly and conclusively 
 settled ; that the same must be adopted as a uniform 
 rule of action ; and that it has become an established 
 maxim in the progress of agricultural improvement, 
 which should not be departed from, that a deep penetra- 
 tion of sward land is absolutely necessary in pi-actice to 
 promote the fertility of the soil and increase the ratio of 
 production, and that farmers who would reap tlie utmost 
 benefits from tillage must alwaj'S bear in mind that which 
 is thus laid down as a criterion for them to go by. But 
 whether this opinion is derived (if I may be allowed to 
 use the expression) wholly from actual observation and 
 practical results; whether all manner of soils have been 
 tried under all circumstances ; and whether the thing has 
 been thoroughly tested to the satisfaction of every un- 
 prejudiced mind, is somcthirg which has not been so 
 completely canvassed as the nature of it seems to re- 
 quire.
