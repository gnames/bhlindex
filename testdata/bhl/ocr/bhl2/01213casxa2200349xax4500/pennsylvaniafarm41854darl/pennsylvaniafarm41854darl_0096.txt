dust, when interfered with, is to bo expected, but it should 
 bo understood that it will only be dust, which, though it 
 may afitH't tlio eyes of a few, will, in the 7nain, prove harm- 
 less till some friendly drizzle shall have laid it for over. 

These reflections lead mo to explain my position at Mer- 
 cer, and the remarks which have been questioned in your 
 Journal, but permit mo first to say that it would have seem- 
 ed fairer, before animadverting upon them, to have placed 
 these remarks more fully before j'onr readers, than to have 
 singled out a passage so well calculated to provoke opposi- 
 tion at hand, from the circumstance of so many Aldernoys 
 being owned by the fashionables in our vicinity. But where 
 or however placed upon trial, or whatever bo the bias or 
 competency of my judges, I sh.all not shrink from the ordeal, 
 if allowed, as is my due, a hearing. 

It would have been easy to have constructed a discourse 
 different from that which I delivered at Mercer, and which 
 no doubt would have been applauded to the echo by those, 
 whose praise is always in proportion as the subject matter in 
 vapidness and vacuity approximates to the condition of 
 their own minds — such praise as no right minded m.an 
 would covet. I might have begun with Adam and Eve, in 
 or out of the garden, t^ikon up Noah with his broad, alluvial 
 fields, teeming with the fertilizing debris of the flood from 
 rocky disintegrations and vegetjible decompositions, thrown 
 in an interesting episode, which could not fail of being pop- 
 ular in these intemperate days, of how Noah cultivated the 
 vine, and how, weak man, he made too free with the j»?'cc of 
 the (ji-'tpc ! From Noah thence to the Patriarchs, affording 
 another interesting incident edifying to breeders, who would 
 desire to produce special results, in the experiments of young 
 Jacob upon the flocks and herds of his fair dealing father- 
 in-law, Laban. Pass from the pastoral patriarchs to the 
 Gentiles, and here Rome would supply a Ciucinnatus, a Vir- 
 gil, &c.; thence to the great farmers of modern times, espe- 
 cially our President farmers, from him of ever blessed mem- 
 ory that sleeps at Mount Vernon, down to the astute cab- 
 bage grower of Kinderhook. Thus a frame work of an- 
 tiquity, universality, glory and patriotism, having unity of 
 purpose, might serve, if the filling up was well managed, to 
 place agriculture in the zenith, and the orator in the ascen- 
 dant too, provided there should not be too many hard-fisted, 
 sound-headed, matter of fiict farmers of the audience. I 
 once was doomed to the infliction of having to sit out a 
 lengthy dissertation, delivered before fin Agricultural Socie- 
 ty on the origin, use, improvement, &g., of tho plow, which 
 began by describing the plow used by Homer, and ending — 
 no matter how. Now when I was called to Mercer to de- 
 liver an agricultural address, I neither thought of appearing 
 learned or eloquent; other thoughts possessed me, such as 
 how I might benefit agriculture in general and the farmers 
 of western Pennsj'lvania in particular ; hence I took occa- 
 sion to caution them against empiricism, and essayed to 
 teach them how to fill the meal bag, the milk pail, and tho 
 beef barrel; these were the leading objects of my mission. 
 Have I succeeded ? The copious extracts taken from the 
 address by the press in diff'erent quarters, favorable com- 
 ments by editors, and numerous private letters from able 
 and distinguished men thanking me for the service I had 
 rendered, will attest that I did not labor in vain. There is 
 only wanting the open opposition to my effort of the corps 
 charlatan ical, to make my cup of gratulation to overflow,and 
 tempt me to be vain indeed. ' 

In pursuance of my object, I spoke decidedly against Al- 
 derney cattle as being unfit for farmers, and to this opinion 
 I still adhere ; the farmers I thought should select profita- 
 ble cattle, such as are of good size, healthy, hardy, and of 
 good milking and feeding properties. The milking proper- 

ty claimed for them by some I attempted to refute, and 
 could it be established, in any general sense, as superior to 
 the common or native cattle, it would leave the Aldernoys 
 destitute of one of the most profitable properties, size and 
 easy feeding — to make a good carcass of beef when the ani- 
 mal comes to bo fed off. How these cattle may suit their 
 native Islands, Alderney, Guernsey and Jersey, in the Brit- 
 ish Channel, with their equable, humid, mild climate, I 
 shall not pretend to question, but sure I am that they are of 
 such delicate habits as unfit them to withstand the scorching 
 heat and intcnsocoldof thiscontincnt. In England, where the 
 climate is more congenial, they are found in Noblomens' 
 parks, by waj' of contrast, I presuino, to the larger breeds, 
 as trees of different shapes and sizes are found in tho same 
 enclosures, to relieve each other and give effect. It is also 
 true that the Duchess, Marchioness, Countess, Ac, have 
 their Alderneys, but this is "the freak of fashion" I alluded 
 to in the address ; so far as the noblesse of this country may 
 choose to imitate the nobility of Great Britain, is not a 
 matter for a farmer like me to presume to enquire into. 

The correspondent of the "Country Gentleman," on Brit- 
 ish agriculture, under date from London, last October, treats 
 of tho different breeds of cattle, but with more discretion 
 than applies to my valor. Ho says, "Were I to express a 
 preference for other than the Durhams, those stately animals 
 would look down upon mo with unutterable contempt : or if 
 I were to prefer them to all others, the Hcrefords might push 
 me to the wall, the Devons run their long horns through mo, 
 the Ayrshires exult in my fall, and even tho little Alderneys 
 paw dirt in my face." In the same letter he gives a con- 
 versation he had with a Wiltshire farmer, who keeps a large 
 stock, and turns off ton head of cattle yearly for beef; he 
 compares the Durhams and Alderneys thus, "The Durham 
 turns off 1400 pounds of beef each, the Alderneys are little 
 better than goats." It is but fair to state that the man of 
 Wilts also said that if he were to keep cattle for the dairy, 
 "he would prefer tho Alderneys, as they give more buttor 
 and cheese ;" but if his practice is to be weighed against the 
 assertion, his prefering Alderneys for the dairy may bo ta- 
 ken for the popular cry and goes for nothing, for though he 
 is a dairyman to the extent, as is stated, of making 22,400 
 pounds of cheese and 4,000 pounds of butter annually, he 
 keeps no Alderneys, "his 60 milch cows are nearly thorough 
 bred Durhams." 

I must now turn to your correspondent "Rusticus," who, 
 from his propensity to quote French and Latin, might, with 
 more propriety, have signed himself "Pedanticus." I like 
 things to be called by their right nnmos. A farmer should 
 write as a farmer, with tho earnest desire of promoting the 
 prosperity of his calling, and a rustic, as such, with sim- 
 plicity and truth. But I presume your correspondent is 
 neither farmer nor rustic, but one of tho fashionables, and 
 therefore, as he belongs to that hornet's nest, I must take 
 such stings as any of the hive miiy be able to inflict, for 
 having dared to thrust my head into it. "Rusticus," how- 
 ever, is stingless, he h.as mistaken his genus as well as his 
 name, for though he shows a disposition to sting, he does 
 not carry the weapon; he is more of a butter-fly than a hor- 
 net. 

Now as to facts — I never said as "Rusticus" woald hare 
 it to appear I did, that butter should be the "color of a 
 rose ;" I said, "tho straw color of the butter of the Alder- 
 neys, so much boasted, is no proof of its excellence — the 
 yellow, tinged with rose, is a more inviting and desirable 
 color, evincing delicacy of flavor and giving assurance of the 
 good health of the cow ;" and I said right, but that was not 
 saying that butter should be, the "color of a rose." The 
 yellow, ti^ngod with rose, gives rise to what is called "rose
