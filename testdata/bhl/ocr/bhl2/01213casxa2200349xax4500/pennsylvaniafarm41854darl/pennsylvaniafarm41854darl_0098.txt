Btandard work. Mr. Youatt approaches the Aldorneys with withiu this range, or in tho United States, were collected to- 
 caution, owing no doubt to his lear of giving offence to the gother and exhibited to the contractors for supplying the 
 nobility, but nevertheless he is decidedly against them, he navy and army with beef, and these gentlemen should be 
 Bays: "The Alderney, considering its vuraciaus ajipetitc—ior told that they roust rely upon such cattle for luliiUing their 
 it devours almost as much as a Short Horn — yields very lit- j contracts, even allowing a reasonable time for feeding oflf, 
 tie milk ; that milk, however, is of extraordinarily excellent j what would they think ? Why it would drive them into ut- 
 quality, and gives more butter" (just what I remarked of all ter despair, for they could not but think that there would be 
 cows that give little milk,) "than can bo obtained" (for the but few carcasses, if any, that would produce one barrel of 
 quantity,) "from any other cow." Ho adds: "Some writers | mess beef to pass inspection. On tho other hand what pru- 

on agriculture have, however, denied It." To carry out his 
 views he quotes Mr. Parkinson, with the remark that Mr. 
 Parkinson "seems to have a determined prejudice against 
 them." Mr. Parkinson is made to say, "their size is small, 
 and they are of as bad a form as can possibly be described ; 
 the bellies of many of them mo four-fifths of their weight; 
 the neck is very thin and hollow ; the shoulders stand up, 
 and is the highest part; they are hollow and narrow behind 
 the shoulders ; the chine is nearly without flesh; the bucks 
 are narrow and sharp at the ends; the rump is short, and 
 they are narrow and light in the brisket." Youatt adds: 
 "This is about as bad a form as can possibly bo described, 
 and the picture is very little exaggerated." 

And I may add that this and Mr. Coleman's description 
 will apply in the main to all that I have seen of them within 
 the last few years up to the present day, and my opportuni- 
 ties, in this regard, in New York, Pennsylvania and Mary- 
 land, have not been few. Suppose all the pure Alderneys 

dent dairyman would venture upon a herd of some 20 to 30 
 pureAldorneysonly, under the expectation of being adequately 
 remunerated for their cost, feed, <tc.? Let any one an- 
 swer. When, therefore, I had witnessed tho lack of pro- 
 fitable cattle on the farn\s of Pennsylvania, and counted the 
 drain upon our coifers by other States, which supply us with 
 beef, butter and cheese to so large an amount, could I do 
 otherwise than, when at Mercer, on the confines of Ohio, to 
 recommend to farmers, as I honestly did, the raising and 
 keeping well sized, profitable cattle, and caution them against 
 feeding such stock as the xMdernoys. In conclusion I am 
 free to say that I am ready to sustain any thing that may be 
 objected to in my Mercer address, if questioned under a re- 
 sponsible name, as frankly as I have responded to your anon- 
 ymous correspondents, "Science" and "Ptusticus," upon efc- 
 cutcheons and Alderneys. Ptospectfully,
