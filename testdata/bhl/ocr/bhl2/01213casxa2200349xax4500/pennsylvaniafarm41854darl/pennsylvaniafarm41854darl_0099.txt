i^S^ 

These engravings are jllustvations of an improved Ci- 
 der Mill and Vegetable Cutter, patented on the 26th of 
 Jxily last, by F. B. Hunt, whose present address is Rich- 
 mond, Indianss 

Figure 1 prospective, and figure 2 a plain view of the 
 machine, with the casing removed. The same letters in 
 each figure refer to corresponding parts. 

This machine is, as exhibited in the engraving, for 
 grinding and pressing apples, but it is also so construct- 
 ed that it m.ay be changed into a straw or vegetable cut- 
 ter, as will be hereafter described. 

When used for grinding and pressing apples, the fruit 
 is poured into the hopper, N ; it is then crushed by the 
 serrated plates on the cylinder; G'' (fig. 2), which is upon 
 the shaft, G, and is rotated by the pinion, D', gearing 
 with D, which is turned by tlie crank, C. The ground 
 apples (pumace) fall from this hopper into the tub, K, 
 and the juice is expressed by the follower, .J, forced 
 downward by the screw, H, working through the ci'oss- 
 piece, I. 

When used as a vegetable or sti-aw cutter, the cylin- 
 der, G'', is removed, and the knives, S (fig. 2), are fas- 
 tened with set screws upon the shaft in its stead. The 
 straw is then placed in the box, M (fig. 1), and is fed up 
 by the cogged roller, E'' (fig. 1), the wheel, E, on the 
 end of the shaft of this roller receiving its motion from 
 the driver, F, on the shaft, P. 

Potatoes, turnips, and other vegetables, can be sliced 
 in a similar manner. The object of the invention is to 
 furnish a machine which shall be convertible into a va- 
 riety of uses, thus saving to the farmer the expense of 

providing several machines for these purposes. As a ci- 
 der mill alone, we should think it a convenient imple- 
 ment, enabling eaoh farmer to make his own cider, in- 
 stead of carting off his apples to a mill at some miles 
 distance, and as it is portable, it can be carried readily 
 from one orchard to another, more easily than the apples 
 and cider carted back and forth. 

But the great merit of the machine is, that after being 
 used through the season of cider making as a dill, it 
 can then be converted into a straw and vegetable cutter 
 for the winter. 

For any further information address the inventor as 
 above. 

THE NIXT STATE FAIR. 
 Public opinion, (and which we presume the committee 
 having charge of the location of our next State Fair, 
 will be guided by to some extent at least,) seems to have 
 settled down in favor of Philadelphia as the place for the 
 next exhibition. This is altogether proper. Two exhi- 
 bitions have been held in the interior, one at our ex- 
 treme western county, and the fourth should of course 
 come to the eastern section of the State. Not only has 
 it been ascertained that the requisite funds, whatever 
 amount is necessary, will be forthcoming, but a highly 
 favorable location, on what was formerly the Powelton 
 estate, and immediately over the Schuylkill, with the 
 river and railro.ad for easy access on either side, has 
 been offered, and will no doubt be accepted. We predict 
 an exhibition, whicli will eclipse all which have preceded 
 it. There is probably more improved stock of different
