aUENON'S SYSTEM. 

Mi*! James Gowen's allusion to the action of tho Phil- 
 adelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture, and the ap- 
 pointment of a committee to make test of Guenon's sys- 
 tem, which he has chosen to denominate "sheer 
 nonsense," has excited some feeling, as might have been 
 expected, on the part of the very intelligent committee 
 ■who subjected it to examination. 

The report was published at the time in the Farm 
 Journal, and as the committee are made by Mr. Gowen 
 to give the weight of their names to "sheer nonsense," 
 one of them has furnished us with the following abstract 
 of the appointment and action of the committee. 

We wish particularly to avoid bringing any personal 
 issues before the readers of the Farm Journal. Our 
 aim for it is to be a practical Work, devoted entirely to 
 the interests of the farming community, and we would 
 be greatly obliged if our correspondents, all of whom we 
 are anxious to give a hearing, would confine themselves 
 as far as possible to the real points in question, without 
 personal allusions or inuendoes. The great cause we are 
 all anxious to promote requires this, and this only. Dif- 
 ferences of opinion of course will exist, and their fair 
 and candid discussion will be advantageous all around in 
 eliciting truth. We have no ambition to make the Farm 
 Journal a medium for angry and intemperate disputa- 
 tion. 

Having ourselves firm faith, from our own observa- 
 tion, in Guenon's system, we much regretted on reading 
 •the Mercer address to find it stigmatised as it was, and 
 ■which we consider to have arisen only from the want of 
 the necessary close examination and study, and without 
 ■which it will only mislead. If the mode adopted by the 
 'Committee of the Philadelphia Society, and by the vari- 
 ous committees in France, to put Guenon's system to the 
 test and to prove its correctness, be not the right plan, we 
 •should really like to know how stronger evidence could 
 be brought to bear on it. The continued incredulity of 
 •one or of several persons is not sufficient to outweigh 
 their reports, and the practice of hundreds of our very 
 best dairymen, who purchase their cows by this rule. 
 If Mr. Gowen is open to con^viction, we hope he may pay 
 a visit to West Chester, when we promise to convince 
 him by positive demonstration. The system, if true, is 
 of sufficient importance to the interests of the farmer, 
 which we know Mr. Gowen is desirous to promote, to in- 
 duce him to spare a day or two in its investigation. 

One of the committee of the Philadelphia Society 
 "Writes us as follows, in reference to the plan they pur- 
 sued and their appointment : 

"The appointment of the committee to examine the 
 probability of Guenon's system being correct and well 
 founded, was made by the chairman, Mr. Gowen, in the 
 usual and in an entirely regular manner. The gentle- 
 man who made the motion, Dr. Elwyn, was not in any 
 way a convert to the system, neither then or now being 

familiar with the details (jf Guenon's theory, but as Mr, 
 Nefflin, the German farmer, stated that he was a profici- 
 ent in the system, from fifteen years study and practical 
 experience, it was thought an excellent opportunity to 
 test its truth, and as far as pos.sible do away with all 
 doubt. A large committee was formed, and all the So- 
 ciety were requested to attend and witness the examina- 
 tion. A phonographic reporter was engaged, and evei-y 
 question that was asked, and every answer that was 
 made, was produced ; after this, as Mr. Nefflin did not 
 understand English, his remarks were read to the own- 
 ers of the cows, so as, in the most thorough way, to test 
 his assertions. In all the cases Mr. Nefflin's remarks 
 were substantiated by the proprietors of the cows. 
 Several of the committee were first rate judges of the 
 animal, and not to be deceived by any one. They were 
 astonished at the result, and reported to the Society the 
 whole proceeding. How a course so entirely regular 
 and so perfectly impartial can be open to the unbecom- 
 ing charge made by the Ex-President, it is impossible to 
 imagine." 

At our request, the gentleman who has been ■writing 
 in the Journal on this subject, over the signature of "Sci- 
 ence," has authorised us to mention his name, Eusebiua 
 H. Townsend, of West Chester. He has for several 
 years given close attention to the subject, is often called 
 on by farmers to buy their cows, and we have had our- 
 selves repeated opportunities to prove his successful ap- 
 plication of Guenon's rules. 

We should be pleased if all our correspondents would 
 be ■willing to write over their own names. Communica- 
 tions in this way go with more effect before the public, 
 and particularly in cases where there are differences of 
 opinion, and in discussion it seems proper that the one 
 party, writing over his name, should know whose opin- 
 ions he is combating. We think it also occasions a more 
 moderate tone of language, and is on several accounts 
 much better. 

In relation to Guenon's system, in addition to other 
 prominent farmers who have proved the system cor- 
 rect and have confidence in it, we are pleased to be 
 able to add that of C. P. Holcomb, the distinguished 
 farmer of Delaware, and favorably kno^wn throughout 
 the country. 

We have also lately seen a letter from Col. M. P. Wil- 
 der, of Massachusetts, to a gentleman in Philadelphia, 
 in which he says : 

"In answer to your enquiry whether the opinions 
 formerly expressed by me, in relation to "Guenon's Sys- 
 tem of Judging Milch Cows," remain xinchanged, I have 
 to say, that I have reason to place great confidence in 
 this theory. I have conversed frequently with the most 
 intelligent and experienced breeders and dairymen of 
 New England and other parts of our country, and have 
 uniformly found the opinions of these gentlemen to co- 
 incide with those of Guenon — in fact, I have not yet met 
 the farmer that has carefully examined this subject, and 
 who does not agree with these views. 

Respectfully yours, 
 MARSHALL P. WILDER." 

This is additional testimony, from a quarter -well 
 known as good authority, both on agricultural and hor- 
 ticultural topics.
