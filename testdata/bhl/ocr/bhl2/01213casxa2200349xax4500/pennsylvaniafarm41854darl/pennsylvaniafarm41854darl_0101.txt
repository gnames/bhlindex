PENNSYLVANIA FAEM SCHOOL. 

AVe have been much disappointed that the project of a 
 Farm School for Pennsj'lvania, to be incorporated by our 
 Legislature, has been reported adversely upon by the 
 committee to whom it was referred, and that there is 
 some fear of its being defeated the present session. For 
 the credit of the State, no less than its substantial inter- 
 ests, we hope this may not be the case. 

We understand the principal cause of the adverse re- 
 port was, that the bill provides for an appropriation of a 
 few thousand dollars in aid of the project. AVe would 
 advise the friends of the measure to waive this point al- 
 together, so as to procure its passage, if this has really 
 been the difficulty. Let us have the incorporation at all 
 events, and that speedily. If the assembled wisdom of 
 the Legislature do not perceive the great advantages, 
 which will result from such an appropriation, (and we 
 entertain no doubt whatever of it,) we hope they will be 
 kind enough to give us a chance to help ourselves. Give 
 us the opportunity, with the aid of the funds of the 
 State Society, and what can certainly be collected by in- 
 dividual subscriptions through the State, to start the 
 Pennsylvania Farm School, to commence the good work, 
 which is really called for by the progress of the age and 
 the example of States, both north and south of us. In- 
 cluding what has been already offered, and the funds of 
 the State Society, an amount not much short of $20,000 
 is on hand to begin with. This will suffice to purchase 
 the land, alter or erect plain buildings, which may be 
 extended hereafter, and when once commenced in the 
 proper spirit, we have no fears but that it will attract 
 and secure by its beneficial influence the confidence of 
 the whole people of the State, and that it will eventually 
 become an object of real State pride, and its happy in- 
 fluences be felt in every quarter. 

We really feel indisposed to argue the subject of the 
 propriety of a Pennsylvania Farm School, where our 
 young men can obtain, in addition to a sound education, 
 a practical and scientific knowledge of that business on 
 which all others hinge, and which lies at the very basis 
 of our strength and progress. It seems almost a slur on 
 popular intelligence to say that such a measure is at all 
 doubtful. 

There is one supposition, and one only, on which we 
 should suppose any objection can be made to a 
 State Farm School, and that is, that the practice of agri- 
 culture in Pennsylvania is now perfect ; that the land is 
 cultivated all over the State to its most productive limit; 
 that the nature of soils, their geological formation, ca- 
 pacities and requirements, are thoroughly understood ; 
 that agricultural machinery has attained the climax of 
 perfection, and is in general use, and that the improved 
 breeds of stock, adapted to each section, are fully dis- 
 seminated. Are these things so ? If not, there is some- 
 thing yet to be learned, and we consider it the duty of 
 our Legislature to aid the accomplishment of these re- 
 sults by every means in their power. The proposed 
 school will be laying broad the very foundations of all 
 true wealth, which depends on productive industry, and 
 the abundant supply of raw materials. Will any politi- 
 cal economist, or even any school boy, say that the pro- 
 duce of land in Pennsylvania cannot be doubled, trebled, 
 quadrupled, by superceding the wasteful practices of 

even our best farming districts with improved and more 
 rational systems of culture ? Look at the average pro- 
 duce of wheat, corn or oats to the acre all over Pennsyl- 
 vania, the average produce in milk and butter of the 
 dairies, and we should like to see the man who would 
 say there is no room for improvement. 

The plan of a Farm School, which was sketched out a 
 year ago by the committee of the State Society, so very 
 full and comprehensive in its details, if carried out, as 
 we have no doubt it would be if placed in the proper 
 hands, would do more for the real prosperity of Pennsyl- 
 vania than any legislative measure which has been enac- 
 ted for years. It would make a permanent central point 
 of attraction, not where the mere theory of agriculture 
 would be taught, but where the true theory would be 
 proved ! It would be the source of knowledge, and in- 
 struction to the intelligent and inquiring farmer outside 
 of it, as well as the young pupil within. Here would he 
 resort to see the improved and various breeds of cattle, 
 to investigate and become acquainted with their habits, 
 peculiarities and diseases ; here he would see, not mere- 
 ly the highly polished and finished implements of inter- 
 ested patentees, bvii the, practical working and advantages 
 of the best and most approved labor saving machinery, 
 and by which he would be guided in his own purchases ; 
 he would learn something of the analysis of soils, the 
 nature of manures and their correct and appropriate ap- 
 plication, and in every department of farm management 
 he would be able to see the application of correct and 
 scientific principles. In the annual reports of such an 
 institution, under a competent superintendent, would b€ 
 found a real treasury of knowledge to the practical far- 
 mer, the benefits of which to our great and gi'owing 
 State, can hardly be too highly estimated. 

Give us the law, and if you will not aid us vrith your 
 (our) money, let us at least have the chance of making 
 the effort to help ourselves. Save Pennsylvania from 
 the disgrace of letting such a measure as this sleep for 
 another year, or perhaps die altogether. Now is the 
 time for action. 

Journal of the United States Agricultural Society 
 Through the politeness of the editor of the above 
 work, W. S. King, we have received a copy containing 
 Nos. 3 and 4. It purports to be a quarterly issue. The 
 present is one of the most valuable compendiums of stan- 
 dard articles we have seen for a long time. Several 
 subjects of great interest to the farmer are very ably 
 treated, and we shall take the opportunity to make copi- 
 ous extracts hereafter for the Farm Journal. We copy 
 one article in the present number by Dr. Brincklfe, "on the 
 Duration of Varieties," and about which there is much 
 difference of opinion. Like every thing else from the 
 Dr.'s pen, it is handled with marked ability. There is 
 an article also on Aldemeys, which we commend to the 
 attention of Mr. Gowen.

 A FEW WORDS ABOUT ROSES. 
 Mr. Editor : — As the season is approaching when 
 farmers and owners of gardens generally are about fix- 
 ing them up for the summer, I have thought a few words 
 about roses would not be out of place at this time.
