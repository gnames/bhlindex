[March 

I place roses first in connectiou with a flower garden, 
 for this reason, that no garden can be perfect without 
 them, and the more of them the better, with colors from 
 pure white to the deepest crimson ; and the great length 
 of their blooming season, from May to November, has 
 obtained for them the enviable reputation of the Queen 
 of flowers. 

I was handed a catalogue of roses by one of our en- 
 terprising nurserymen a short time since, which contain- 
 ed a list of between five and six hundred varieties. To 
 the uninitiated in rose culture this seems perfectly 
 alarming, but one can breath more freely when he ^ows 
 that six to eight can be selected from a hundred and yet 
 have a very good selection. I love roses and grow a 
 good many of them, and the object of these few remarks 
 is to name, for those who want, a small selection of roses 
 which I have proved to be good. 

I will begin with the Bengal or daily roses ; Archduke 
 Charles, crimson, pink centre; Indian, or pink daily; 
 Cels, blush; Aggripina, brilliant crimson; Lady War- 
 render, blush white; Madame Breon, deep rose. The 
 above are all good bloomers, and with me are perfectly 
 hardy. 

I admire the Boui'bons as a class more than any other. 
 With their fine double flowers and beautiful foliage they 
 are hard to be excelled. Here are half a dozen Bourbons: 
 Souvenir de la Malmaison, blush, very large ; Hermosa, 
 pink ; Dupetit Thouars, crimson ; Leveson Gower, bright 
 rose; Mrs. Bosanquet, blush, changing to white; Lady 
 Canning, dark rose. 

The two follo-vving varieties I have found to make ex- 
 cellent pillar roses: Triomphe de la Duchere, bright 
 rose, pale centre; Souvenir d'Anselme, bright red. 

The Noisette roses are mostly runners ; some of them 
 are not as hardy as others. Here are six Noisettes : Chro- 
 matella, or cloth of gold, yellow, the finest yellow rose I 
 have ever seen; Jaune Desprez, rose buff; Fellenberg, 
 bright red ; Ophire, yellow, tinged with red ; Lamarque, 
 white, yellow centre; Superbus, pink, large clusters. 

The Hybrid Perpetuals, commonly called monthly 
 roses, do not generally give satisfaction ; the complaint 
 is they only bloom once a year. Here is a few that may 
 be exempted from that fault : Amanda Patenot, pale 
 rose ; Giant of the Battle, brilliant crimson ; La Reine, 
 rosy lilac; Marquise Bocella, pale pink; Pius 9th, deep 
 crimson ; Rivers, crimson. 

I do not wish to be understood to say that the roses I 
 have noticed are the best of the diffei'ent classes, but 
 that they are a good selection for those who want only a 
 few. 

Moss roses are deservedly great favorites in their sea- 
 son, but of all I have seen none equals the old red for its 
 mossy bud. The perpetual white makes a pretty bud, 
 but the flower, like the red, when expanded is trifling. 
 The crested moss is very distinct, and like moss. Ade- 
 laides, when expanded, are good flowers of a pink 
 color. 

There are several other classes of roses, which are of 
 little use in small gardens. I will mention a few varie- 
 ties that are distinct and good : Persian Yellow, the best 
 hardy yellow rose ; White Mycrophylla, white, with yel- 
 low centre ; Prairie Queen, pink, fine for covering ar- 
 bors. 

The best Multiflora roses I have seen are Laure De- 
 voust, pink, and Grevillia, or seven sisters, white to deep 
 red. 

Roses to do well must have deep rich soils. What 
 miserable specimens we oftentimes see in the gardens 
 around our town houses, and yet we are told there was 
 plenty of manure put in the hole, and the soU is loosen- 
 ed very often, and they are watered with soap suds once 
 week, but all to no purpose. But a little examination 
 tells the tale, which, in nine cases out of ten, is this : — 
 When the house is being built, the garden or lot is not 
 exactly to the grade of the street ; the consequence is a 
 lot of cellar dirt, with the aid of a few brickbats sup- 
 plying the deficiency, and the bushes are planted in it 
 according to the rule described. The remedy is evident 
 — take out the poor soil, and replace with good loam or 
 soil from the woods, or any place where it is good, and I 
 will venture to say you will have plenty of roses from 
 May to November. ROSA.

SUBSOIL PLOWING AND PENNOCK'S COEN DRILL, 

Oakland Farm, 2d mo. 17, 1854. 

J. L. Darlington : — Thinking the result of my ex- 
 periments with the subsoil plow the past season, which I 
 procured partly at your suggestion, miglit interest some 
 of the readers of your Journal, I am induced to offer a 
 few facts in relation thereto. 

The field, containing fifteen acres, intended for com, 
 was partly flat, the soil being a stiff clay, slightly inter- 
 mixed with silicious gravel, the balance being high and 
 loose. The former never yielding over 30 to 35 bushels; 
 the latter was considered the best corn ground on the 
 farm, yielding from 70 to 80 bushels per acre in good 
 seasons. 

It was the first of these portions, containing 7 acres, 
 that we concluded to subsoil. It was first plowed seven 
 inches deep with one of White's iron plows, Rodgers' 
 subsoil following, loosening the earth about eight inches, 
 making the whole depth fifteen inches. After plowing, 
 the ground was well harrowed, and the corn drilled 
 in with Pennock's corn drill, the rows being four 
 feet apart, and one to two grains. 15 to 18 inches distant 
 in the drills. There was no manure applied, either 
 broadcast or in the rows, and the yield was estimated by 
 several experienced corn growers at from 75 to 80 bush- 
 els per acre — an equal, if not gi-eater yield, than the 
 other half the field, which, as I before remarked, was 
 good corn land. Had it not been for the subsoiling, the 
 season being unfavorable, I do not think the amount pro- 
 duced would have exceeded one-third. I had thought 
 the subsoil plow would have required a stronger team, 
 but it proved to be the reverse, as one yoke of cattle 
 drew the subsoil with greater ease than two yoke of 
 equal size and strength did the barshare. 

I was so much pleased with the effect on my corn, that 
 I subsoiled the wheat ground, and from present appear- 
 ances it bids fair to equal expectations, as it has pre- 
 served its rich green appearance all winter, and looks 
 now like a watered meadow. The result can't be got at 
 till harvest, and as my neighbor has his wheat adjoining 
 on the same kind of soil, equally well manured and put
