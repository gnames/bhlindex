in in the best manner, as he is noted for doing things 
 nicely and skillfully, a comparison can be had when har- 
 vested and threshed. 

To our valley soils I think subsoiling peculiarly adap- 
 ted, more so perhaps than on the porous, light soils of 
 the more hilly portions of the county. I anticipate great 
 benefit to the grass crop, more especially to the clover, 
 which even now, shallow as our soil is, in times of 
 drought proves to be our main dependance, owing to its 
 long roots running deep enough to be out of reach of the 
 sun's powerful rays, and in winter it will be less liable 
 to be thrown out by frost. Thinking its introduction 
 would prove of more value, in our section particularly, 
 than any improvement of recent date, I should be pleas- 
 ed to see it more generally adopted, believing from my 
 own slight experience that stiff clayey ground, thorough- 
 ly subsoiled and the after preparation duly attended to, 
 will yield a much better return than the usual mode of 
 shallow plowing, even with the addition of a coat of ma- 
 nure. 

While on this subject I must speak a word in favor of 
 the drill, as it is a novelty in these parts. It did the 
 work well — a man and boy planting the field (15 acres) 
 in a day and half — a great saving of labor, without men- 
 tioning other advantages, which is a desideratum now 
 farm laborers are so scarce. Yours truly,

FARMING IN SUSSEX. 

Mk. Editor : — In glancing over some back numbers 
 of the Farm Journal recently, I noticed a communication 
 from a "Delawai'O Farmer," hailing from New Castle 
 county, and "running his rigs" upon "sandy Sussex," as 
 he is pleased to style our county. If it is not tresspass- 
 ing too much upon your good nature, I would like to say 
 a word or two in this matter, and give you a brief out- 
 line of our manner of farming. 

We consider Sussex county as well adapted to agricul- 
 tural purposes as any part of Delaware, and susceptible 
 of as high a state of cultivation. There is a vein of 
 land running through our county, and, indeed, extend- 
 ing across the peninsula, that is very sandy. This tract 
 is known by the name of the "sand hills," and is alto- 
 gether made land, having been at no very distant period 
 a strait or bay, connecting the Atlantic Ocean with Ches- 
 apeake Bay. With this exception Sussex county is gen- 
 erally a clay bottom. 

In manuring our land we use both guano and liipe lib- 
 erallj-, but principally the latter, as we find lime to be a 
 better fertilizer with us than guano. The guano gener- 
 ally makes one good crop, and paj's very well on corn 
 and potatoes. With three hundred pounds to the acre, 
 we can average four hundred bushels of Irish potatoes, 
 or about fifty bushels of corn. But our second crop 
 finds the land very little better from the application of 
 the guano. 

We generally put from fifty to one hundred bushels of 
 lime to the acre, during July or August, if possible to 
 get it at that time, having learned from experience that 
 lime spread, at that season of the year, upon a good 
 crop of clover, or other vegetable matter, will pay the 
 fanner twice the amount, in the first crop, that it will if 

spread on the ground in the spring, and immediately 
 turned under for seeding. 

Our land is not so well adapted to growing wheat, and 
 we pay less attention to it than our friends in New Cas- 
 tle county. Some of our farmers, however, raise very 
 good wheat crops, equally as good as New Castle county 
 can do with the same expense. One of your correspon- 
 dents from that county, tells us that he harrows his 
 ground three times, puts four hundred pounds of guano 
 to the acre, drills it twice and rolls it, and raises from 
 thirty to forty-seven bushels per acre. We harrow our 
 ground once, and drill it but one way, seeding two bush- 
 els per acre, and realise from thirty to fifty bushels per 
 acre, (I mean on such land as we have suitable for wheat.) 
 But there is a large portion of our land, too low and wet 
 for wheat, that will produce every year, without any 
 rest, from fifty to seventy-five bushels of corn to the 
 acre. 

With this brief and hasty sketch of the state of agri- 
 culture "down in Sandy Sussex, where the farmers have 
 to hang up their plows at night to keep them from being 
 lost in the sand by morning," according to the account 
 given of us by your New Castle correspondent, I would 
 tender him our thanks for the interest manifested in our 
 behalf. Nevertheless the most of us down here are so 
 wrapped up in the "dai-kness that covers the land," that 
 for the life of us we cannot take in the idea that New 
 Castle county is "the bright particular star" in the agri- 
 cultural firmament of our little State. I have lived 
 neighbor to that county for half a century, visited their 
 farm houses, schools, churches, &c., and returned home 
 with the impressions I started with, viz : that there was 
 "room for improvement" in New Castle as well as in 
 Sussex ! 

But we must "own up" that New Castle is ahead of 

us in some things, for instance, the Sheriff' 's Office is 

worth five times as much as it is in Sussex ! With less 

pretensions to greatness, we eat our pork and beans, 

smoke our pipes, and read the Farm Journal, without 

his sheriffship coming to "molest us or make us afraid." 

But I am tresspassing on your time, Mr. Editor 

Yours, &c.,

SMOKY CHIMNEYS. 

Mr. Editor : — I observe an article in your Journal, 
 taken from the Scientific American, entitled "a remedy 
 for smoky chimneys," which may be calculated to 
 strengthen the already prevailing opinion of the mason, 
 that the draught of chimneys depends primarily upon 
 the conformation of the flue. 

This is an error that has led to much injury in the 
 erection of chimneys. Draught in chimneys depends al- 
 together on scientific principles, and the laws bj- which 
 it is governed is as invai-iable as any other of the laws 
 of nature. That a chimney may draw well, the flue 
 must be perfectly air tight, that is, it must be "tcell 
 parged;'' 2d, it must be of suflBcient heighth. 18 feet is 
 sufficient, to give draught to a close stove, and may an- 
 swer for a fire-place in many situations where there are 
 no eddies of the atmosphere occasioned by high adjacent 
 walls, and where the area of the opening of the fire- 
 place is not too large.
