It must be remembered that smoke and heated atmos- 
 phere is of lighter specific gravity than common air, and 
 arises in the flue, occupying the whole spiice of the flue, 
 hence if cold air is permitted to enter the flue, either at 
 the fire-place, or in any part of the flue, the draft will 
 be diminished, and the chimney will smoke, especially if 
 the situation of the chimney is such as to be liable to a 
 downward current of wind from without, or in stormy 
 weather. In situations where the stove pipe or chimney 
 blows down, the best remedy is a cone on the pipe, or a 
 flat plate over the top of the flue, sufficiently high, say 
 15 inches, above the top of the flue or pipe to let the 
 smoke have a free passage out in every direction, and 
 wide enough to pi'event the current of air from blowing 
 down, say 4 inches wider than the flue on all sides.

 THE KEPORT ON DAIRIES. 

Mk. Editor : — A writer in your February number 
 complains of the imperfect report of the Committee on 
 Dairies of the Chester County Agricultural Society, as 
 being calculated to mislead, rather than benefit, the 
 public. So far as came to the knowledge of that com- 
 mittee, the account as published is correct. They stated 
 the amount of butter made, the price sold for, the 
 amount received for calves, the worth of the refuse milk 
 in pork, the expenses of manufacturing the butter and 
 getting it to market, the interest on cows, fixtures, &c. 
 Does "J. B. G." suppose that the Messrs. Dickey paid 
 $179 70 for merely making the butter and preparing it 
 for market, that he enquires after the salaries paid for 
 help to feed, milk, &c. ? 

Had the committee attempted to estimate the wear and 
 tear of fixtures, and the depreciation of the cows by 
 sickness, death, or old age, they would most likely have 
 made a very imperfect one, and calculated to mislead 
 the public, as they confess their inability to figure out 
 how long cows will be likely to live, or what will be the 
 wear and tear of crockery and milk pails in a year's 
 time. In regard to the depreciatiou of stock, however, 
 the committee stated that the Messrs. Dickey, by their 
 judicious management in introducing improved breeds, 
 will add yearly a large per centage to the value of their 
 dairy stock. For facts in regard to this matter we need 
 only refer to our townsman, A. Bolmar, Esq., who com- 
 menced his dairy a few years ago with selected common 
 stock, and by the introduction of the Durham has now 
 one of the finest dairies in the State. Instead of its de- 
 creasing in value, it has increased more than one hun- 
 dred per cent. So it will be with every rightly managed 
 dairy — instead of depreciating, the stock will be contin- 
 ually improving and becoming more valuable. 

ONE OF THE COMMITTEE. 

Centre County Agricultural Society. 

Extracts from the minutes of the annual meeting ol 
 the Society, held at Bellefonte, Jan. 24th, 1854. 

The President, Hon. Geo. Boal, in the chair. The sub- 
 ject under discussion being the "Improvement of Stock," 
 Mr. Samuel Gilleland presented the following preamble 
 and resolutions : 

Whereas, it is an admitted truth among farmers that 
 an improvement of their common breeds of stock would 

prove highly advantageous to their interests, and can by 
 proper eflbrts be readily introduced among them, and 
 whereas, from the fact that so many inferior, worthless 
 and scrubby seed animals run at large throughout our 
 State, it is impossible for those who are desirous oi 
 improving their stock to secure so praiseworthy an object; 

Therefore, resolved, that in our opinion, the levying 
 of a suitable and reasonable tax by the State on all 
 stallions, bulls, boars and rams, would have the efi"ect of 
 soon replacing inferior animals by those of a superior 
 breed and quality, and thus prove of essential advan- 
 tage to the farming interests and to the breeder of stock, 
 and also secure to the treasury a handsome fund to be ap- 
 plied towards the liquidation of our State debt. 

Resolved, that a copy of the foregoing be forwarded 
 by the President and Secretary to our Senator and Re- 
 presentative at Ilarrisburg, and request them to lay the 
 same before their respective Houses, and also urge the 
 passage of an act of Assembly in compliance therewith. 

Mr. Gilleland addressed the Society at length, urging 
 the adoption of the resolutions, and producing calcula- 
 tions showing the amount to be derived throughout the 
 State by the passage of such an act of Assembly. 

The resolutions were unanimously concurred in.

SEED POTATOES. 

One of our friends, a very close and intelligent obser- 
 ver as well as good practical farmer, has been in the 
 habit for many years of selecting the largest and finest 
 potatoes for seed. Those who have pui-chased of him 
 have long remarked one peculiarity about them not found 
 elsewhere, that they are nearly all of a uniform size, with 
 no small ones mixed through them. His neighbors have 
 observed this without knowing the reason, which our 
 friend attributes entirely to selecting the seed as above 
 for a course of years, and thus establishing the size as a 
 permanent characteristic. That like produces like is 
 the foundation of all improvement in both vegetable and 
 animal life. The advantages respectively of large or 
 small potatoes for seed, have long been before the pub- 
 lic, and the question has generally been decided after 
 the trial of a single season, or two seasons, when the ef- 
 fect would not be so perceptible. Here, on the other 
 hand, are the results from continued care for a course of 
 years, and we consider them highly interesting and im- 
 portant. 

Since penning the above, we have received the follow- 
 ing communication from our friend Wm. Jackson, which 
 throws further light on this important subject: 

IMPROVEMENT OF THE POTATOE, 

By a proper selection of Tubers for planting. 
 My attention was particularly attracted to this sub- 
 ject about forty years ago, by frequently observing a 
 marked difference between the potatoes raised by my 
 brother (since deceased) and those which we raised at 
 the homestead, where I resided. His were almost uni- 
 formly large and finely formed, and when viewed in 
 mass were much superior to ours in appearance. They 
 were, however, from the same stock, and the two farms 
 were adjoining, and were very similar in soil and state
