NATIONAL POULTRY EXHIBITION. 

We are pleased to learn that at the National Poultry 
 Show, held at Barnum's Museum, New York, last month, 
 the noble specimens of Cochin Chinas, imported by Wm. C. 
 RuDMAN, Esq., Philadelphia, and figured in Farm Jour- 
 nal of last May, took the first premium — a silver cup, 
 value $20. These same fowls took the first premium at 
 the New York State Exhibition, held at Albany last 
 month, also. The Black Spanish Foxvls of our friend 
 Rudman, figured in last volume of Farm Journal, also 
 took the first premium at the Albany Exhibition. 

We pi'onounced these fowls the finest specimens of the 
 kind we had ever seen, at tlie time of publishing their 
 portraits in the Journal, and we are happy to be thus 
 confirmed in our good opinion of them. 

SOUTHDOWN SHEEP. 
 This Buck (see plate) is an excellent portrait of 
 a superior Southdown Buck, which has taken the first 
 premium at two of our State Exhibitions, (the last one 
 at Pittsburg,) and is probably the best buck of this breed 
 south of New York. The engraving is highly creditable 
 7 

to the skill of the artist, Edward Clarkson, of Philadel- 
 phia, and also to Dr. Charles Carpenter, of Marshalton, 
 a few miles from West Chester, who drew him from life, 
 and has been very fortunate in catching his true form 
 and character. To draw correctly an animal portrait is 
 an attainment possessed by the very few, and from other 
 specimens we have seen from Dr. Carpenter's pencil, we 
 think he only needs practice to make him eminent in this 
 line. The buck before us developes finely the valuable 
 points of the Southdown sheep, in the round, barrel 
 shaped, compact carcass, full and heavy hind quarter, 
 with a slight rising on the loin, which are the parts of 
 most value to the butcher and consumer. 

This breed of sheep have of late been attracting much 
 of public favor, and for attaining weight, within a cer- 
 tain compass or size, we believe they are unsurpassed. 
 The fine and delicate flavor of the mutton is also every- 
 where esteemed. They are extremely liardy, will thrive 
 where other breeds would hardly live, and either on the 
 thin and chalky hills of Devonshire, or on rich pastures, 
 they seem equally at home. In this neigliborhood the 
 flocks of Joseph Cope and John Worth have been bred 
 with great care, and contain some beautiful animals, 
 which have been sent at different times to various parts 
 of the Union. J. Cope visited England some years ago, 
 and brought home some valuable specimens from Messrs. 
 Grantham and Ellman's flocks, and they have also ob- 
 tained valuable crosses from some of the best breeders 
 of Downs in New York State. In this vicinity, on our 
 rich and strong pastures, many of their animals have at- 
 tained a size and perfection not often met with elsewhere, 
 and which has been the admiration of strangers. The 
 fleece of the Southdown is of a medium quality between 
 the coarse and fine wools. 

Jonas Webb, of Babraham, Cambridgeshire, is the most 
 distinguished breeder of Downs at present in England, 
 and has taken most of the prizes of latter years at their 
 exhibitions. Colman, in his European agriculture, 
 speaks of being present at one of his annual lettings, 
 when 177 of his bucks were lei for one season, at public
