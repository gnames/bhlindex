auction, to the highest bidder, at prices from £7 to £50 
 each ; a large proportion between £20 and £40. This 
 will give some idea of the way they are estimated in 
 England. To those who wish to purchase Downs, we

 Worth with entire confidence. 

WORK FOR THE MONTH. 

Farm. — Sow clover seed on wheat fields, before the 
 ground gets settled, at the rate of 5 or 6 quarts per 
 acre. Timothy, Italian rye, green grass, &c., may also 
 now be sown, if not done in the fall. Use none but 
 clean seed. Plough ground and put in oats crop as soon 
 as the weather will admit, sowing not less than from 2 to 
 3 bushels per acre. Pass a roller over after harrowing. 
 Roll mowing and recent pasture ground. This settles 
 such roots as have been heaved up by winter. Sow plas- 
 ter, one bushel per acre, over all the grass fields. This 
 should be done this month, so as to have the benefit of 
 moisture in the soil, and spring rains. The ammonia in 
 rain water, by combination with plaster, forms the non- 
 volatile sulphate of ammonia. The effects of plaster are 
 not so observable in a very dry season. Guano mixed 
 with plaster may also be sown with advantage as a top 
 dressing to grass lands, in a damp spell of weather, or 
 just previous to rain ; but superphosphate of lime for 
 this purpose is preferable. Haul out manure from the 
 barnyard for corn and potatoe crops, which are gross 
 feeders, and require it ; using for the wheat crop in fall 
 guano and superphosphate of lime, thus making ?7iore 
 corn and more tvheat. Hire an extra hand or two for a 
 few weeks, to accomplish this in season. The fermenta- 
 tion of the manure in the soil stimulates the early growth, 
 and affords food for the maturing of the crop. Plough 
 deeply and subsoil corn ground. Top dress winter grain 
 which was not manured last fall. Plant potatoes for 
 early crop, as soon as ground will admit. Give particu- 
 lar attention to cows which have calved, and ewes having 
 lambed. Succulent food, such as turnips, carrots, beets, 
 increases the flow of milk, and should always be given 
 in addition to grain and hay. Feed the mothers well, is 
 the true plan to make good lambs. Have a piece of ear- 
 ly pasture ground to turn them on. Give extra feeding 
 to working cattle. At leisure times, clean out thorough- 
 ly and whitewash poultry houses inside. Pick stones off 
 mowing fields. Open the mouths of drains. 

Fruit Orchard. — Attend to directions of last month, 
 and perform what was omitted. Planting of trees in this 
 section can be done during this month. Select the best 
 varieties of fruit trees, and plant apple trees from 35 to 
 40 feet apart ; peach, pear, plum and cherry trees 20 
 feet apart ; dwarf pears from 10 to 12 feet apart. 
 Grafting may be done this month. Prepare grafting 
 wax by mixing three parts of bees wax, three parts of 
 rosin, and two of tallow. Plant out gooseberry and cur- 
 rant cuttings, first removing all the lower eyes. Trench 
 and prepare the ground thoroughly with short manure. 
 Grape vine cuttings should be planted with two eyes out 
 of the ground, and in a soil rather sandy and moist. 
 Trim grape vines at once, if not already done, and dig 
 in around the roots well rotted manure. Strip off of all 
 trees cocoons and larvse of insects, and apply wash be- 
 fore recommended. Apply salt to quince trees. Manure 
 and clear up strawberry and raspberry beds, and make 

new plantations of each. Uncover such of the latter as 
 were laid down last fall for protection. 

Vegetable Garden. — The operations of the garden 
 for this month must depend on the weather, and the con- 
 dition of the ground. Seeds not easily injured by frosts 
 should be sown, such as peas, beets, paranips, lettuce, 
 radish seed, onion seed and sets, early carrots, aspara- 
 gus seeds for new beds ; and plant out two year old roots, 
 cabbage seed, &c. If the weather is suitable, cabbage, 
 lettuce and cauliflowers may be planted out from frames. 
 Uncover spinach, parsley, lettuce, &c. Trench ground 
 for horse-radish, and set out pieces of old roots in rich 
 soil. Dress up rhubarb, and manure thoroughly if not 
 already done. Give close attention to frames, &c., and 
 cover on cold nights. Give air on fine days. Tomato, 
 pepper and egg plants, which have grown thickly, should 
 be pricked out into other frames. Start Lima beans in 
 sods inverted, within doors, so as to be ready for plant- 
 ing out for early crops, so soon as the weather is settled. 
 Set out beds of sage, sweet marjoram, winter savory, 
 pennyroyal, and other perennial herbs, by dividing the 
 roots of old plants. Plant sweet potatoes in hot beds for 
 sprouting, and cucumbers in frames for forcing. As a 
 general rule in gardening, make deep soil, manure heav- 
 ily, and use plenty of seed. Better to thin out than 
 have to re-sow. 

Flower Garden — This is a busy month in the Flow- 
 er Garden. Remove the covering from the roses, and all 
 half hardy things. Loosen the fastenings of junipers, 
 Irish yews, &c., by which they had been secured against 
 winter storms. Prune roses and flowering shrubs. To 
 prime roses, observe in the running varieties, to cut as 
 much old wood as possible, leaving only shoots of the 
 previous summer's growth ; shorten them one-third, and 
 secure them firmly to the trellis or stake. Daily roses 
 treat as above, only shorten their shoots two-thirds. 
 The Hybrid perpetuals and hardy garden roses should be 
 pruned back to three or four eyes of the old wood. 
 Roses will give more satisfaction by being closely pruned 
 than otherwise. In pruning shrubs, cut out any dead 
 wood ; thin out the branches where they crowd each oth- 
 er ; shorten any straggling branches ; by this means 
 they will assume a good shape. Secure honeysuckles, 
 clematises and other running vines firmly to their trelli- 
 ses. Manure liberally roses and flowering shrubs. This 
 is a good time to plant all kinds of shrubbery and ever- 
 greens, and all kinds of hardy biennals and perennials. 
 All such as have grown too large should be taken up, 
 separated and replanted immediately. Remove the cov- 
 ering of leaves or litter from the tulip beds, or other ar- 
 ticles which had been protected by them during the win- 
 ter. Tulips, hyacinths, and all other hardy bulbs, may 
 be planted early this month. Trim and replant box- 
 edging. Manure and dig flower beds. Sweep clean and 
 roll well lawns and grass plats. Laying sod should be 
 attended to this month. Clean and roll gravel walks, 
 and make every thing look neat and clean. Now is the 
 time to raise annuals from seed for early planting. 
 Plants in windows which have done blooming, should be 
 removed to a cooler place, and their shoots shortened 
 considerably. Plants in cellars should have air admit- 
 ted to them freely in mild weather, and be watered more 
 liberally than during winter.
