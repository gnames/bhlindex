Etseemed Friend : — The chilling blast of winter howls 
 around this inland town, and all the beauty of the foliage 
 and verdure in its suburbs, are exchanged for the glistening 
 snow that covers the ground, and hangs in icy wreaths up- 
 on the trees, There is little at this season of the year, to 
 be seen in this part of the country that will be of much im- 
 portance to the farmer. One who like your correspondent, 
 has been habituated, to the scenes of rural life, will on chang- 
 ing his residence for that of the city ever long to stroll by 
 times amongst the more fumilar objects of the country. 
 Leipsic presents excellent opportunities for the gratification 
 of this desire. No town that I have ever seen in the United 
 States affords an equal opportunity for enjoying all the 
 beauties of the countrj', so very close to the town. Indeed 
 I might say we have the country, with even its lonely forest, 
 almost dirbctly in the town. In half an hour's walk from the 
 center of this town of 65,000 inhabitants one can find him- 
 self in the silent depths of a dense forest, whore no sound 
 strikes the ear, save that of the squirels, the birds and other 
 things that pertain to untamed nature. It is needless to say 
 that I have sought repose from the busy scenes of the city 
 in this quiet forest; but now that the cold blast of winter 
 howls through the naked trees, their enchanting solitude is 
 gone. 

But there is not much in either town or country, that is 
 calculated to remind the traveller of the scenes of home. The 
 reccollection of fences, will fast fade from his memory, as 
 he roams over the plains of Germany, where no fence meets 
 the eye. At first it appeared odd to see roads leading off 
 across the fields with grain on either side, and no fence to 
 protect it. But this grows familar, and even now, I think a 
 glance over a land where hills and vallies are marked with 
 fences, would present quite an interesting spectacle. The 
 forest I spoke of, is on the western side of the city. A 
 short time since, while the sheep yet nipped the green herbage 
 of the meadows, and the sun shone more pleasantly upon 
 them, I took a walk into the country in the direction of this 
 forest. The road leading to it passes off through meadow 
 land, much of which is now overflowed, and to render it pas- 
 sable during wot weather the road is raised a few feet above 
 the meadow land. Being thus elevated it renders the traveller 
 quite conspicuous, as he rides his horse, pulls his little wag- 
 on to market, or drives a delapidated two horse wagon with 
 onlj' one horse to it, attached to one side of the tongue, (this 
 being a very frequontway of going to market.) This meadow 
 land can be used only for pasture, except at great expense 
 in preparing it for the plow. The river runs on one side of it, 
 and on the banks of the latter in one place I observed a nur- 
 sery of young trees designed for ornamental purposes in part, 
 but more particularly to set out in the low swampy ground 
 to raise timber from. The center ground of the nursery, em- 
 br.acing three or four acres was raised about four feet above 
 the level of the meadow and surrounded by a ditch to keep 
 the water drained off. 

Beside the nursery were several very large compost heaps. 
 Every possible resource is made available to supply mater- 
 ial to the soil. The land is a black clay ; being used in 
 large quantity to make brick, though the latter are as black 
 as though thoy were made of Chester county swamp mud, 
 still they are burnt, when they become red. This clay ex- 
 tends to the depth of about 7 or 8 feet, and rests on gravel. 
 The river washes this gravel from beneath the clay, and the 
 latter falls in, carrying with it bushes, weeds, roots and oth- 
 er organic matter, which mingles with the loose sand thrown 

up by the floods. This sand is just what the clayey land 
 wants ; and so much organic matter as might be contained 
 in an arm load of roots, would be entirely too much to lose 
 where labor is as cheap as it is here, and accordingly these 
 marshes of clay, sand, gravel, roots, <tc., are thrown out in 
 large quantities and mixed with various materials, such as 
 street scrapings from the town. 

These piles after standing long enough to allow decompo- 
 sition of the organic matter to some extent, are thrown upon 
 the cultivated land. The theory of this mixing immense 
 quantites of sand with clayey land, to bring it to a proper 
 mechanical condition, is a good one, ))ut for practical purpo- 
 ses it requires rather much labor for a country like ours, ex- 
 cept in the neighborhood of large towns, or where the farm- 
 er has .sandy earth that must be removed for other purposes. 

Crossing the river on an old bridge I entered the forest. 
 By selecting the least frequented paths a few moments found 
 mo in the silent woods, with the (luiet inmates of the forests, 
 Avith huge stumps that looked as though they had stood the 
 blasts of centuries, around mo. To stand in the solitude of 
 the w(>odp, with the stately trees arching over head and shut- 
 ing out the sunlight, and the thick under brush filling up tho 
 interval beneath I could almost forget that <atown was near. 
 The large trees are principally left untouched by the axe, 
 while such of the smaller ones, as would interfere with each 
 others growth above are selected by the woodman. Ileuce, 
 instead of seeing the havoc of the backwoods-man who falls 
 the large trees upon the small ones and brings all down to- 
 gether in one general crash, we see only hero and there and 
 close to the ground, the stump of a little tree, that has been 
 deemed an intruder upon tho means for proper develop- 
 ment in the others around it. Following a narrow path 
 for half an hour, I met a hunter with his dog and gun. 
 (This will give an idea of the extent of the woods.) It 
 is a great addition to the health and comfort of the inhabi- 
 tants of a town, thus to have some place to ramble in the 
 pure fresh air, away from the bustle of the street. Leipsic 
 is well supplied with such places and who ever sees them 
 and contemplates their worth must feel that too little pains 
 are taken to secure such things to our American Towns, 
 while they are yet in their infancy. On the meadows I 
 noticed several flocks of sheep that in the absence of fences 
 were guarded by a boy who watches them during the day ; 
 and as the evening comes on, he steps out before them and 
 calls, they all flock around him, and he moves off towards 
 the sheep pen, which sometimes is in the town. Tho sheep 
 seem to have become so familar with the boy that they 
 crowd around him, more as though he was one of their 
 number, than their driver. He comes into tho town with 
 them crowding before and behind him, from one side of the 
 street to the other. 

The sheep are of about an ordinary quality. Tho same re- 
 mark is applicable to their cattlo, while their horses are rath- 
 er inferior, many of them in connection with their old wag- 
 ons, not much unlike some that may be seen in the spring 
 of the year in the southern part of Chester county, attach- 
 ed to *'fish-wagons." 

Their wagon beds are very roughly made, consisting of a 
 rough frame such as is often used on wagon wheels to haul 
 in hay. The axletree extends about 5 inches through the 
 hub, making an excellent affair to pull down bar posts had 
 they any fences ; and what makes it look still more odd, is a 
 brace that slips on tho end of the axletree outside the wheel 
 and is returned in its place at the lower end of tho linch 
 pin, while the other end extends up, and is attached to the 
 railing of the wugon bed, to keep the latter from spreading 
 when loaded. 

They have no determinate size for their wagon wheels,
