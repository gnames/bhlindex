bushels of Carrots for horse food; besides at least a dozen 
 other things, this garden contains fiv^ or six grass plats, 11 
 standard Pear Trees, 36 Dwarf Pears, 12 Dwarf Apple, 4 
 Plums, 3 Filberts, 10 Cherries, 3 Orange Quinces, a small 
 nursery of Shade Trees, raised from tho seed, 20 large Arbor 
 Vitaes, a Graperj', a Pigeon House, a large Fish Pond, a 
 Flower Pit or Green House, 8 Hot Beds, 6 varieties of Rasp- 
 berries, several varieties of currants and goosberries ; do- 
 mesticated Blackberries, a variety of Flowers on either 
 side of tho main avenue, and yet this little plot of ground 
 is not crowded. 

Tho other part of this said farm of two acres, not occupied 
 by buildings, contains about an acre, which is divided 
 into two fields, which produced about 3 tons of prime Timo- 
 thy Hay. 

His jjlan of gardening is this — -first of all ho makes a list 
 of everything he intends to plant during the whole season, 
 placing the seeds or plants in regular succession as they 
 may be wanted, with the date at about which it is necessary 
 to sow or plant them. As it is almost impossible for a per- 
 son engaged in other business to think of a particular thing 
 he wishes planted at a particular time, this plan is very ad- 
 vantageous. 

The remarks of Mr. Freas, upon the cultivation of sun- 
 dry vegetables are so practical, and calculated to bo useful, 
 that I report them in full. 

The Carrot, he says, requires more than common 
 attention, whether in the garden or field. As horse food 
 he regards bushel for bushel to be worth much more than 
 oats. They keep his horse in fine condition and his health 
 is excellent. He makes it a rule to deprive bis horse of 
 half a peck of oatd per daj', and substitute half a peck of 
 carrots ; they should be fed without washing, and the half 
 of this quantity at a mess. The carrot should of course be 
 buried, and take from the pit only a sufficiency for three or 
 four days, or a week. 

The ground intended for carrots, should be loosened as 
 deeply as possible by the spade and if plowed, it should be 
 subsoiled. It should be particularly well manured and pulver- 
 ized, the seed is very small and must come in close contact 
 with the soil, to cause it to vegetate. Plenty of seed must 
 be sown, of course in rows; if in the garden, 15 inches apart 
 is enough, but in the field 30 inches. Care must be taken to 
 cover the seed but slightly, and press the earth upon it, 
 when two or three inches high the plant should be thinned 
 out so that they will stand six or eight inches from each 
 other. They must be well cultivated and kept clear of weeds 
 until they reach a certain height, when they will take care 
 of themselves. As a field crop they are troublesome, requi- 
 ring much labor, yet I venture to say, that what their real 
 value is, is not properly understood. For instance, in the 
 city of Philadelphia, where they command a ready sale and 
 a good price, a more, or perhaps an equally profitable crop 
 cannot be produced on the farm. The variety for culinary 
 purposes, is known as the Horn carrot, those for field cul- 
 ture as the Orange Carrot. 

Okra or GtJMBO, is cultivated in the same way as corn, 
 when the grains are dropped a foot apart, instead of in hills. 
 This Okra is, however, sometimes difficult to vegetate, es- 
 pecially when the seed is purchased, and it is not known how 
 old it is. I have always been successful when I planted seed 
 of my own raising. 

Egg Plants should not be set out before the first of June, 
 and the ground should be made as rich as the best barn-yard 
 manure can make it. This plant having short roots and pro- 
 ducing large fruit, requires strong soil. The best plants 
 should be set out, and they should be protected from the sun 
 during the heat of the day by conical shaped boxes 12 or 14 
 inches high, made of rough boards, and open at the top, these 
 boxes can also bo used as a protection at night in the event 
 of cold weather. This is one of the most delicate of plants, 
 and if it should be overtaken by a couple of cold nights, it 

will be put back for at least two weeks. Properly cultivated 
 it produces, abundantly, one of the very best vegetables to 
 be found in the garden, and with which none of the many sub- 
 stitutes, such as the vegetable squash, and others, are at 
 all to bo compared. 

The Frigole or Black Mexican Beak, I have raised 
 for a number of years. I regard it the best of all beans foi" 
 winter. It is a universal dish in Mexico, and is also largely 
 cultivated in Texas. Itis a small black bunch bean, likes a 
 light soil, if a little sandy the better; a southern hillside 
 would perhaps suit it well. It is planted in rows and two 
 hoeings at most is all that is required. It is sometimes called 
 the Turtle Soup Bean, from the richness of the soup made 
 from it. When first introduced into this country, it sold at a 
 dollar a pint. I would readily p.ay that for the seed rather 
 do without it for a single year. There is a single objection to 
 this bean on the part of the house-keeper, which is, that it 
 makes the soup as black as ink, as well as any thing boiled 
 with it ; but this only afFects appearances, and has nothing 
 to do with the intrinsic value of the bean; we must there- 
 fore regard it, as I hope we all would an individual — not ac- 
 cording to his external appearance, but his merit. 

Cantelopes.~I presume that most of you raise your own 
 Cantelopes. If any of you should not, I hope j'ou will com- 
 mence tho next season. They are grown with as much cer- 
 tainty as the cucumber, and without any more trouble. The 
 character of the soil has little to do with it, provided the hills 
 are prepared properly. My garden lies low and is but poorly 
 adapted to the cantelope. 1 overcome this by hauling a few 
 wheelbarrow loads of turnpike dirt from the gutters, but pure 
 sand would be preferable. The hills are made about eight 
 feet apart, the ground is dug out about 8 or 10 inches deep, 
 2 feet in diameter ; when the bole ie half filled with this dirt 
 and the other half filled with fine manure and soil, all well 
 mixed together ; but the hill is made no high(?r than the 
 surrounding soil, as it retains the moisture much longer on a 
 level surface, six or eight seeds are put at equal distances in 
 each hill, reduced to three or four when the plants are two or 
 three inches high when I add to the hill a top dressing of 
 turnpike dirt or sand to the depth of an inch, removing the 
 weeds once or twice, and until the vines extend 2 or 3 feet 
 from the hill, After that there will be no injury from weeds 
 and the work is done. As fine, richly flavored melons as 
 can be raised in the sands of Jersey, are by this method pi"o- 
 in my garden every year. I obtained the past season, at 
 least 75 cantelopes, from a bed about 30 by 16 feet. It is ad- 
 visable to change the seed about every other year. Where 
 you have alight soil on a hill side, with a. Southern expo- 
 sure j-ou may raise them in perfection, with no more labor or 
 expense than a crop of pumpkins. 

Watermelons also, upon such soil, equal to tho best id 
 tho Philadelphia market, can be produced in any quantities. 
 For two years I had superior Watermelons, but owing to the 
 increase of shade and want of room I reluctantly abandoned 
 their cultivation. The first year I grew 22 edible melons 
 from three hills, one of them weighing 29 pounds; and there 
 is no reason why our farmers should not supply all ^boir 
 wants in this respect. There is no mystery about it at all, as 
 tho farmers in my neighborhood used to suppose until they 
 were convinced to the contrary. The best variety of Cante- 
 lope to cultivate is the Citron— of Watermelons, the Moun- 
 tain Sweets are to be preferred, both from their excellent 
 quality and productiveness. 

Mr. Freas then spoke respecting Currants, Raspberries, 
 Gooseberries, Cherries, Pears ; spoke very highly of the 
 dwarf pears; thinks them much the most profitable kind, 
 <te. ; spoke of hot-beds, and the necessity of each farmer 
 having them ; gave considerable valuable instruction re- 
 specting them. He then proceeded to speak of flower pits. 
 "It may," said he, "perhaps be new to some of you, that the 
 most delicate flowers and shrubs can be preserved through 
 the winter in a growing, healthy condition if placed in »
