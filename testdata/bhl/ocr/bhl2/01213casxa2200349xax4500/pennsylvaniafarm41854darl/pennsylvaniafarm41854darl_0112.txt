The importance of arrivingat acorrect solution of the ques- 
 tion cannot be too highly estimated, especially if it bo true 
 that varieties do wear out. For, in this event, those cultiva- 
 tors who plant extensive orchards of kinds which have pas- 

the glass. It is necessary every clear day, without reference 
 to the severity of the weather, to raise the sash for an hour 
 or two at mid-day to admit fresh air, otherwise the power of 
 the sun will wilt and destroy the plants. Roses, particular- 
 ly, do better where there is no fire, and I find that our horti- 
 culturists or nurserymen are beginning to discover this fact, 
 and save the expense of furnaces and ftiel.

For wise purposes, all terrestrial objects appear to be so 
 constructed as fo bo constitutionally liable to the destruc- 
 tive effects of time. This is equally true of animate and in- 
 aninintfl bodies. Impressed with this belief, we cannot re- 
 gard varieties of fruit as an exception to this universal law of 
 nature. 

Before proceeding further, h»wever with our remarks, we

pots should be stirred frequently, and never be allowed to be- 1 pertaining to horticultural, s.iys : "While we admit that, in

After noticing some other matters interesting to the horticul- 
 turist, &c., (fee, Mr. Freas concluded by saying that "he re- 
 gards the pursuit of agriculture as the noblest calling that 
 engages human effort. It is," said he, "the offspring of the 
 Almighty. _ It was the first pursuit of man, and it will con- 
 tinue until time shall be no more to be his principal pursuit, 
 and upon which all others must depend. All its ramifica- 
 tions exercise an ennobling and edifying influence, which 
 may be termed the religion of nature, sanctified by the di- 
 vine approbation. 

"Agriculture is a peaceful occupation. Its very instincts 

the common mode of propagation, varieties are constantly lia- 
 able to decay or become coinparativolj' worthless, we believe 
 that this is owing not to natural limits set upon the duration 
 of a variety ; that it docs not depend on the longevity of the 
 parent tree ; but upon the care with which the sort is propa- 
 gated and the nature of the climate or soil where the tree is 
 grown." Now it is said to be presumed that the White Doj'- 
 enne, or the Brown Bourre, or the Chaumontclle, or Old Col- 
 mar have been propagntcd with less care than the Autumn 
 Bergamot which, it is alledged, bears as fine fruit now iis it 
 did nearly two thousand years ago. And where is the evi- 
 dence that the climate, in the vicinity of Philadelphia or Bos- 
 ton, has become so altered within a few years ; — or that the 
 soil has been so exhausted of essential inorganic elements, — 

lead to a life of quiet retirement and good neighborhood. It ; as to prevent the White Doyenne from bearing the .same fine 
 is domestic — it is patriarchal — and more fully developes the fruits it did, formerly, in these localities. Had there been a 
 love of home, and familj-, and friends, as well as an att.ich- | deficiency in the soil, of any of those requisite elemcntc, sr.re- 
 ment to the institutions of the country, than any other. The i '^ '* '''°,"'<! ^'''"' ^«*'" demonstrated by analysis. What the

the territory of a friendly nation— he is not the disturber of soil is light, and has been exhausted, by long cultivation, of 
 the public peace — he is not the turbulent politician — he is lime, potash and phosphates, the inorganic elements abso- 
 not the wild sjJfeculator in stocks, who m.akes a fortune in one h'tcly necessary to the production of tine pears, many vnri- 
 hour and loses two in another— he does not scramble with his ' '^^^^^ *^"'*" ^"""^ flourished well, are now feeble, and the fruit 

is often blighted." That the blighting of the fruit is attribu- 
 table to the cause here assigned is clearly established by the 
 fact that, in this very same soil, other pear trees, and various 
 crops do well, that require just as much of these essential in- 
 organic elements, as do those varieties which it is conceded 
 no longer flourish there. 

In regard to the Autumn Bergamot, even admitting that 
 it has been in existence nearly two thousand years, and that 
 it bears as abundant crops of as fair fruit as it ever did, can 
 we legitimately draw the inference that this variety will 
 never wear out? As well might we contend that a man, who 
 has arrived at the age of three score and ten, will live for- 
 ever, because he did not perish in infancy or in the prime of 
 life, like the rest of the offspring of the same parents, whose 
 constitutions were intrinsically more feeble and consequent- 
 ly, less able to resist destructive influences. 

Again, it has been argued that the Brown Beurre and 
 White Doyenne cannot be worn out varieties, since they 
 comprise nearly half the pear trees annually introduced from 
 Franco into this country. This is owing either to the fruit 
 of these kinds being held in high estimation in Franco at 
 this time, or to their commanding a ready sale here. If the 
 former, the market of Paris must still be abundantly sup- 
 plied with them, as in former days, which is not the case. 
 Then they are only sent here because they are saleable. 
 And the demand for them in this country continues for throe 
 reasons : — 1st, they have always enjoyed a high reputation 

neighbor in the same business for a customer for his goods by 
 underbidding and false representations. He is guilty of 
 none of these, but he follows the noiseless tenor of his waj', 
 happy in his position, free as the air ho breathes, .and inde- 
 pendent as it is possible for a private man to be. It is such 
 as he, that I look upon as the pillars of our great national fa- 
 bric, for without whom it would speedily crumble into ruins. 
 I believe what I say. 

'In conclusion, my friends, I will repeat with a devoted 
 friend of the cause, that the instinct of agriculture is for 
 peace — for the empire of reason, not of violence — of votes, 
 not of bayonets. Nor shall we as freemen and members of a 
 domestic fireside profession, hesitate in our choice of the 

three great master influences which now rule the world 

force, opinion and affection — the cartridge-box, the ballot- 
 box and the band-box\" 

Fruits— Thoughts on the Duration of Varieties. 

Do v.arieties of fruit wear out? The affirmative side of 
 this question was maintained with singular zeal and ability, 
 by the late Thomas Andrew Knight, President of the Lon- 
 don Horticultural Society. And in our country his views 
 have found an able advocate in Mr. Townley, of Wiscon«in.
