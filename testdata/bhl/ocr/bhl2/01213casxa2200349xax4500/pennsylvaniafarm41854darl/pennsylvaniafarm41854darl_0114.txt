HOVEY'S PATENT HAY 

The above cut Is a representation of William Hovey's 
 Improved l*atent Hay, Sti-aw and Corn Stalk Cutter, the 
 only cylinder cutter, with knives adjustable on the cyl- 
 inder, that cuts on a hide roller. The patent was grant- 
 ed to William Hovey, February 12th, 1844, was strongly 
 contested in the United States Court at Boston, and fully 
 established in 184.5, Several imitations of this machine 
 have been made with the view of evading the patent, but 
 the patentee informs us that not a single machine, made 
 by him or under his direction, till within a few months 
 past, has been sold in Pliiladelphia. Machines some- 
 what similar, as well as the new cutters, being constant- 
 ly introduced, have to some extent superseded these old 
 favorites. Although these new patents have generally 
 originated in the New England States, they have mostly 
 run their course, and, at the pi-esent time, but few of 
 them are to be found in that section of the Union, the 
 cylinder cutters, cutting on a hide roller, being found 
 more durable and less liable to get out of order. In the 
 multitude of patent straw cutters, which are only ex- 
 ceeded in number by patent cooking stoves and bee- 
 hives, we have often felt at a loss when called for an 
 opinion which to recommend to the farmer. We wish to 
 introduce all, that have really merit, to the readers of 
 our Journal, so that farmers can judge for themselves 
 from the illustration and description. With this view 
 we have asked of patentees the use of their cuts, and 
 also give them space for a full description. Each ma- 
 chine thus stands on its own merits, our object is attain- 
 ed in introducing to our readers new and improved ma- 
 chines, and the farmer is the judge for himself. Wc may 
 remark that most straw cutters, which cut on a hide 
 roller, are constructed to make a longer cut of hay or 
 straw than many others. The theory of cut feed being, 
 not only to avoid waste, but also to induce a full masti- 
 cation before passing into the stomach. If cut only 
 about half an inch, it will be often swallowed, like whole 
 grain without the grinding and bruising process in the 
 mouth, which is considered important to thorough diges- 
 tion. One inch to an inch and a quarter is considered 
 by many to be the proper length, to produce the full ad-

vantages of cut feed. Paschall Morris & Co., northeast 
 corner of Seventh and Market streets, Philadelphia, have 
 been appointed agents for the above machine. 

In reference to them, William Hovey, the patentee, 
 wi'ites us as follows, and we offer the same opportunity 
 of description to patentees of other machines, so as to 
 bring them before the public : â€” 

"My machine will be warranted to cut faster and with 
 much less power applied to operate them than any other 
 straw cutter in the market. They are not like several 
 other kinds of cylinder shear cutters misnamed self sharp' 
 eners, but they profess merits of vastlj' more importance to 
 the user, viz : they are not self dtiUers, and not like cyl- 
 inder shears that come in hard contact with the bed shear 
 before a cut can be made. These have a natural ten- 
 dency to cut themselves up, which they never fail to ac- 
 complish if kept in operation. All shears may with 
 equal propriety be styled self sharpeners as those ap- 
 plied to straw cutlers, and consequently are all self 
 duUers ; but the cylinder cutters that cut on a roller 
 have nothing to dull thera but the substance they sever, 
 and will last with careful usage a year without grinding, 
 and when grinding becomes necessary, on AVm. Hovey's 
 Patent Cylinder, each knife can be taken off separately, 
 ground on a common grindstone, and replaced, and in 
 case one knife should be more narrow than the others it 
 can be adjusted, or set out to accommodate the others 
 with great facility and perfection. This principle of ad- 
 justing the knives on the cylinder is the leading claim in 
 the patent, and cannot be used by others without an in- 
 fringement. Great improvements have been made on 
 these cutters since they were patented. Some have been 
 made under a license with the name of Wm, Hovey's 
 patent marked on them, and large numbers have been 
 sold in Philadelphia, marked C. Hovey & Co., but like 
 all the rest they had nothing to do with Wm, Hovey's 
 patent, nor his improvements. Power machines will be 
 furnished to order, capable of cutting from one to two 
 tons of hay, straAV or cornstalks in one hour. Samples 
 of these power cutters will soon be forwarded to Phila* 
 de'phia."
