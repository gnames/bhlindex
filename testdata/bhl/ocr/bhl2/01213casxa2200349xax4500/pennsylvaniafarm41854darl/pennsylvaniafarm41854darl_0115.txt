In regard to the hereditary diseases of horses we shall 
 consider, first, those of a local nature, afterwards proceed- 
 ing to those which are more general in their character, and 
 which affect the system as a whole. 

Local hereditary diseases are usually simple in their na- 
 ture, and consequently their predisposing causes are eatiily 
 traced, and usually consist in some peculiarity of external 
 form more or less obvious. This observation chiefly applies 
 to several sorts of lameness, which we shall now notice. 

Boiie Spavin consists in inflammation of the ligamentous 
 and synovial connections of the bones of the hock, and 
 usually of those between the cuneiform medium and meta- 
 tarsal bone. Effusion occurs, forming an exostosis or bony 
 tumour on the antero-internal part of the hock, attended 
 during its formation with great pain and consequent lame- 
 ness. Violent and continued exertion, especially when the 
 animal is growing, is the usual immediate cause of this dis- 
 ease. The amount of strain of the parts affected, and the 
 consequent liability to the disease, are always greatest where 
 the width and strength of the limb below the hock are dis- 
 proportioned to its width and strength above the hock. Horses 
 of such conformation are unusually predisposed to the most 
 troublesome and serious cases of spavin, and hand down to 
 their progeny a similar conformation and predisposition. 
 Other bony deposits besides spavins are also more apt to af- 
 fect some families than others. This tendency may depend 
 on an endeavor on the part of oature to strengthen a local 
 weakness, as well as on a general disposition to the forma- 
 tion of exostosis — a disposition alwaj's more frequent and 
 stronger in the horse than in most other animals. 

Curb is a strain of the calcaneo-cuboid, or posterior 
 straight ligament of the hixik, causing pain and swelling on 
 the postero-internal part of the joint. Horses most subject 
 to it are those in which the hock is straight and the os calcis 
 short and inclining forwards. 

Of all the complaints to which horses are liable there is 
 none more frequent, more troublesome, or more tedious than 
 strain of the hack teudanii. It usually consists in rupture of 
 the minute fibres of the tendo perforans, or of the strong 
 check ligament attached to it. To repair this injury inflam- 
 mation is established ; effusion soon follows, and occasional- 
 ly thickening and shortening of the limb. The frequency 
 ami severity of this accident might be greatly diminished by 
 breeding only from animals witli sound well formed limbs. 
 The chances of its occurrence are least in horses having 
 well shaped knees, sufiiciently large both in their anterior 
 and lateral aspects, with the tendons prominent from the 
 fetlock upwards — a formation which gives a flat ajipearance 
 to the limb when viewed from the side. Horses, on the oth- 
 er hand, with round legs and small knees, to which the ton- 
 dons are tightly bound down, are especiallj' sul)ject to 
 strains, on account otthc want of that full prominence of 
 the posterior part of the knee wliich is found in limbs of a 
 more perfect conforrasitiou, and which gives a mechanical 
 advantage to the tendons passing over it. With the aid of 
 this lever the tendons perform the work required of tliem 
 with ease and safety: without it, they are apt to suffer from 
 the sudden and violent shocks to which they are subjected, 
 especially when the horse is put to fast work. 

Xurieiilar JJiacuse depends upon strain or laceration of 

the tendo perforans just where it passes over the navicular 
 bone. It causes pain and tenderness of the parts affected, a 
 short, tripping, but cautious gait, a wiring in of the heels, 
 and a wasting of the muscles of the shoulder, with all the 
 other well known symptoms of grogginess. The predispo- 
 sition to this disease is especially gi-eat in horses with nar- 
 row chests, upright pasterns, and out-turned toes. Even 
 with average work, horses in which this conformation is de- 
 cided can scarcely fail to become groggy, for the distance 
 between the point at which the tendo perforans is inserted 
 into the os pedis and that at which it passes over the navi- 
 cular bone is so short, and the angle it makes so acute, that 
 the tendon acts at a mechanical disadvantage, and is con- 
 stantly liable to strain. But defects like these rarely occur 
 singly, there usually existing in addition a want of mutual 
 adjustment between other parts of the limb. Kavicular dis- 
 ease is, therefore, to a certain extent hereditary, in so far as 
 there are certain forms of limb especially subject to it. A 
 tendency to it exists in several stocks that have come under 
 my own observation; and I am informed by a veterinary 
 friend, Mr. Tuthill, long resident in Ireland, that ho knows 
 of the progeny of several Irish horses, in which navicular 
 disease is so common, that they are always looked upon with 
 suspicion, and bring in consequence lower prices than their 
 general appearance would otherwise warrant. The progeny 
 of "Young Musician," for example, a thorough-bred horse, 
 well known in Ireland, and especially in the western coun- 
 ties, all show a great tendency to this disease. 

Acute diseases are usually referable to some cause or cau- 
 ses which are often violent in their nature, but operate for a 
 comparatively short time ; their special locality may bo de- 
 termined, or their type or intensity modified, by the particu- 
 lar constitution of difi'erent animals; they seldom, however, 
 owe their existence to inherent hereditary causes. Chronic 
 diseases, on the other hand, usually result from the continu- 
 ed operation of causes inadequate to induce acute maladies ; 
 they often occur as consequences of badly treated or acute 
 attacks, their development is greatly dependent upon the 
 special constitution of the individual, and many of them are 
 more or loss hereditary. No diseases better illustrate this 
 than those affecting the respiratory organs, such as chronic 
 cough, thick-wind, and roaring, all of which are usually he- 
 reditary. 

Chronic Cough depends on excessive irritability of the mu- 
 cous membrane of the trachea or brouchii, and often occurs 
 as a consequence of bronchitis. In unfavorable states of 
 the atmosphere it is greatlj' aggravated, and in all such 
 cases the slightest over-exertion is sufficient to cause a pain- 
 ful, harassing cough. This irritable condition is very apt to 
 be hereditary. A thickened state of the same mucous mem- 
 brane, inducing thick wind, grunting, and some of the cases 
 considered as broken wind, is also hereditary : and the same 
 obtains with roaring, especially that form of it which alone, 
 in strict propriety, is entitled to the name, and which C( n- 
 sists in atrophy, "or wasting of some of the muscles of the 
 liirj-nx, especially the crico-arytajnoideus posticus. In con- 
 sequence of this wasting, the cartilages of tho larynx fall 
 inwards at every inspiration, and the conse(iuent diminution 
 of the passage through which the air passes causes in respi- 
 ration a peculiar roaring, grating sound. If the ear be ap- 
 plied to the throat of a roarer, there may usually be heard 
 at each inspiration a grating flap, caused by tho cartilage 
 falling inwards, It is important to observe that this sound, 
 as also the roaring noise accompanying it, occurs during iji- 
 spiratLon: for when such a sound occurs during f j-piri^i«"», .
