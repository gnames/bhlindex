it indicates a morbid condition of the lower part of tlie bron- 
 chial tubes. In roaring, the particular timbre or quality of 
 t-lio Found varies considerably, according to the amount of 
 the obstruction. Where this is very great, and the diameter 
 of the tube much reduced, a sharp whistling noise is pro- 
 duced ; while, if there be loss diminution in the calibre of 
 the tube, a deep roaring or grunting noise is observed. 
 Hence whistling is not in all cases, as is generally believed, 
 .a less serious, but, on the contrary, is frequently a much 
 more serious, afTection tti.an roaring, resulting, as it often 
 does, from an aggravated state of the same morbid condi- 
 tion on which roaring depends. Roaring may be readily 
 detected, even when not very bad, by giving the animal a 
 gallop, which renders the defect apparent by increasing the 
 rapidity and depth of the respirations, or by suddenly 
 threatening to strike the animal, or giving him a smartblow 
 on the ribs, which causes a sigh or deep-drawn inspiration, 
 and thus gives rise to the sound characteristic of the disease. 
 Pressure on the larynx also ind;'ces loud and repeated 
 coughing, and in such cases it is observable that each par- 
 ticular cough has a different sound. 

Many cases, illustrating the hereditary nature of roaring, 
 might here be cited. The celebrated horse "Outcry" was 
 well known to be a roarer; many of his stock, out of per- 
 fectly sound dams, have turned out roarers ; and I am in- 
 formed, on competent authority, that the defect of the sire 
 has, in several instances, been very evident in the third 
 generation. Some time ago, a friend of my own got from 
 Northumberland two young horses of considerable value. 
 Though perfectly sound at the time of purchase, both soon 
 after became roarers : they had been bought from different 
 breeders, but, on inquiry, it was found that both wore got 
 by the same sire, and that many more of his progeny had 
 also become affected by the same disease. 

But roaring may occur independently of hereditary cau- 
 ses. It is occasionally produced by the presence of tumours 
 in the larynx or trachea; more often by constrained posi- 
 â– tions of the head and tight reining, and hence frequently 
 occurs in old carriage horses. It is sometimes met with in 
 erib-biters, from their being made to wear str.aps buckled 
 too tightly round the throat. It supervenes from bad at- 
 tacks of bronchitis, especially when of frequent occurrence, 
 and also from phlebitis, being caused in the latter instance 
 by defective nutrition of the muscles of tho larynx. But 
 oven in cases where roaring is not congenital, but is pro- 
 duced during the lifetime of the animal, and by accidental 
 causes, it may manifest a hereditary tendency. There is, 
 indeed, no accidental defect more commonly transmitted 
 from parent to offspring than that on which roaring de- 
 pends. 

Considerable caution is requisite in judging as to the ex- 
 istence of roaring in stallions of the heavier breeds, for 
 three-fourths of these, when briskly exercised, produce a 
 loud roaring noise, which often occurs without any disease 
 of the larynx, trachea, or any part of the respiratory appa- 
 ratus. It results from the high spirit and condition in which 
 entire horses are usually kept, from the acute angle at whi;h 
 thoy generally carry the head, the abundant deposition of 
 cellular tissue and fat about the throat, the comparatively 
 small width between the sides of the lower jaw, the great 
 development of the muscles of the neck, and the thickness 
 of the mucous membrane lining the larynx and contiguous 
 parts. But tho noise so produced is somewhat different from 
 that depending upon morbid peculiarities. It is observed 
 during expiration as well as inspiration, and usually disap- 
 pears when tho nose is elevated so as to bo placed as much 
 as possible in a line with the nock. AVhen the sound has 
 these distinguishing characters, and occurs in animals of 
 the heavier breeds with well formed necks and chests, it is 
 not likely to be productive of any bad effects, or to bo he- 
 reditary. All such sounds occurring in the lighter breeds of 
 horses must, however, bo regarded with great suspicion. 

There are few diseases in which hereditary tendencies are 
 BO manifest as in that variety of deep-seated ophthalmia, or 
 inflammation of the eye, recognised by veterinarians under 
 the various titles of periodic, specific, or constitutional oph- 
 thalmia and moon-blindness. In this disease the inflamma- 
 tion involves, to a greater or less degree, all the internal 
 parts of the eye, exhibits a great tendency to effusion of 
 lymph, often attacks only one eye at a time, but, on subsi- 
 ding in the one first attacked, is very apt to appear in the 
 other; always leaves the eye affected dim, weak, and sus- 
 ceptible to a future attack, and is seldom entirely got rid of 
 until blindness of at least one eye has been induced. The 

symptoms of tliis disease are usually tolerably well marked. 
 The mucous membrane and its various appendages are in- 
 flamed ; there is copious secretion of tears, groat pain and 
 tenderness, and marked intolerance of light. The cornea, 
 becomes opaque and for some time intercepts tho view of 
 the parts within. Tho eye-lids are nearly closed, and the 
 eye-ball within when visible through the cornea soon loses 
 its clear transparency, in consequence of the humours be- 
 coming of a muddy yellowish-brown color from effusion of 
 Ij'mph. Febrile symptoms arc present, and are greatly more 
 intense than might be anticipated from the c<imparatively 
 small size of tho part affected. After two or three days 
 there is often a remission in the intensity of the disease, the 
 external parts being less inflamed and the dull muddiness of 
 the cornea and interior gradually diminishing. A recur- 
 rence of the acute inflammation, or its transference to tho 
 previously sound eye, is always, however, much to be dread- 
 ed. Sometimes the ej'e apparent!}' recovers, and the super- 
 ficial observer might consider it perfectly healthy, Imt the 
 more experienced will find, on careful inspection, sufficient 
 evidence that tho organ has been the seat of disease, and 
 that there still remains a change of structure which predis- 
 poses to subsequent attacks. The eye seems smaller than 
 its fellow, and still remains intolerant of light : tho cornea 
 is often dull, the margins of the pupil frequently uneven 
 and ragged, and the movements of tho iris impeded by ad- 
 hesions ; tho more deep-seated parts have a peculiar leaden 
 appearance, and shreds of lymph may sometimes be ob- 
 served floating in the aqueous humor, or embedded in the 
 crystalline lens or its capsule: the last conditi(m constitu- 
 ting what is technically called a cataract. This may vary 
 much in size, being sometimes a speck scarcely perceptible, 
 and interfering slightly with vision: at other times large, 
 with white lines passing outwards in every direction, and 
 causing nearly total blindness. Eyes having any of these 
 appearances must be regarded as unsound, and specially 
 susceptible of inflammation, which is apt to be excited in 
 them by such causes, as exposure to cold, high feeding, over 
 work, or debility, and is liable to return again and. again, 
 until the animal is totally blind. But before the occurrence 
 of an acute attack it is scarcely possible, without an exami- 
 nation of its progenitors, to determine positively whether an 
 animal is predisposed to periodic ophthalmia. Horses with 
 small dark eyes, large, coarse heads, and of dull and phleg- 
 matic disposition, are, however, generally considered to be 
 specially subject to the disease. There is seldom any very 
 apparent defect of the eyes, either in structure or function ; 
 still it cannot be doubted that there exists in them some pe- 
 culiarity of conformation or of minute texture differing from 
 health, and which, although generally unobservable, is yet 
 cabable, under favoring circumstances, of fostering serious 
 and irremediable disease. 

Ample evidence can be adduced in support of the heredi- 
 tary nature of ophthalmia. Cases of congenital blindness 
 in stock subject to it are recorded. These, however, are 
 rare ; but opacities of the cornea and cataracts are not un- 
 common. The tendency to the disease frequently shows it- 
 self before the animal has been stabled or worked ; but more 
 commonly, such changes in the mode of life appear to be the 
 immediate cause of the attack. A very large number of the 
 stock of the celebrated Irish horse "Cregan" have become 
 affected by ophthalmia of the worst kind. I am told by a 
 gentleman well acquainted with this stock that the tendency 
 is still decidedly marked even in the fourth and fifth gener- 
 ations, often appearing, and sometimes speedily causing 
 blindness, very early in life, as at two or three years of age, 
 and even before the animals have been exposed to what 
 are considered the ordinary exciting causes of ophthal- 
 mia. 

Specific ophthalmia affords a good illustration of a malady 
 which, although usually hereditary, is occasionally produced 
 by accidental causes, and to all appearance independently of 
 hereditary tendency ; and this two-fold mode of production 
 has given rise to much contrariety of opinion concerning the 
 hereditary nature of the complaint. It is sometimes pro- 
 duced even in its worst form by over-work and injudicious 
 feeding, but such accidental cases are seldom hereditary, 
 for, as we have above remarked, acquired peculiarities are 
 less likely to be hereditary than inherent ones. From this 
 it is obvious, that all blind animals are not at once to be 
 condemned as unfit for getting sound and perfect stock. 
 The cause of their blindness must bo inquired into ; and 
 when it can be shown that they have lost their sight from 
 accidental causes, and that tho stock from which they sprung
