SPECIFIC MANTTRES. 

BY THE LATE A. J. DOWNING. 

Wo think no one at all familiar with Modern Chemistry 
 or Scientific Agriculture can for a moment deny the value of 
 gpecific manures. It is the great platform upon which the 
 scientific culture of the present day stands, and which 
 raises it so high above the old empirical routine of the last 
 century. But in order to be able to make practical applica- 
 tion, with any tolerable chance of success, of the doctrine of 
 special m.anures, wo must have before us careful analyses of 
 the composition of the plants we propose to cultivate. Sci- 
 ence has proved to us that there are substances which are of 
 universal value as food for plants ; but it is now no less cer- 
 tain that, as the composition of difterent plants, and even 
 different species of plants, differs very widely, so must cer- 
 tain substances essential to the growth of the plant be pres- 
 ent in the soil, or that growth is feeble and iniiierfect. 

A little observation will satisfy any careful inquirer, that 
 but little is yet practically known of the proper mode of 
 manuring orchardu, and rendering them uniformly produc- 
 tive. To s.ay that in almost every neighborhood, orchards 
 will be found which bear large crops of fine fruit, while oth- 
 ers, not half a mile off, produce only small crops ; that in 
 one part of tho countrj' a given kind of fruit is always large 
 and fair, and in another it is always spotted and defective; 
 (hat barnyard manure seems to produce but little effect in 
 remedying theio evils : that orchards often nearly cease 
 bearing while yet the trees are in full maturity, and by no 
 means in a worn-out or dying condition : — to say all this, is 
 only to repeat what every experienced cultivator of orchards 
 is familiar with, but for which few or no practical cultivators 
 have the explanation ready. 

We have seen a heavy application of common manure 
 made to apple trees, which were in this inexplicable condi- 
 tion of bearing no sound fruit, without producing any good 
 effects. The trees grew more luxuriantly, but the fruit was 
 still knotty and inferior. In this state of things, the baffled 
 practical man very properly attributes it to some inherent 
 defect in the soil, and looks to the Chemist for aid. 

Wo are glad to bo able to say this aid is forthcoming. 
 Many valuable analyses of the ashes of trees and plants 
 have been made lately at Gicusen, and may be found in the 
 appendix to the last edition of Liobig's Agricultural Chem- 
 istry. And still more recently, Dr. Emmons, of Albany, 
 well known by his labors in the cause of Scientific Agricui- 
 culture, has devoted considerable time and attention to as- 
 certaining the elements which enter into the composition of 
 the inorganic parts of trees. 

The result of this investigation we consider of the high- 
 est importance to the fruit cultivator and the orchardist. In 
 fact, though still imperfect, it clears up many difficult points, 
 and gives us some basis, for a more philosophical sj'stem of 
 manuring orchards than has yet prevailed. 

The importance of the gaseous and more soluble manures 
 — ammonia, nitrogen, <fcc. — to the whole vegetable kingdom, 
 has long been [jretty thoroughly appreciated. The old- 
 fashioned, practical man, who stands by his well-rotted 
 barnyard compost, and tho new school disciple, who uses 
 guano and liquid manures, are both ready witnesses to prove 
 the universal and vital importance of these animal fertili- 
 zers, — manures that accelerate tho growth and give volume 
 and bulk to every part of a tree or plant. 

But the value and importance of tho heavier and more 
 insoluble earihy elements have often been disputed; and, 
 though ably demonstrated of late, they are still compara- 
 tively few who understand their application, or who have 
 any clear and definite ideas of their value in tho economy of 
 vegetable structure. 

To got at tho exact quantities of these ingredient", which 
 enter into the composition of plants, it is necessary to ana- 
 lyse their a^ihes. 

It is nut our purpo.se, at the present moment to go beyond 
 the limits of tho orrhard. We shall therefore confine our- 

selves to the most important elements which make up the 
 wood and bark of the apple, the pear, and the grape- 
 vine. 

According to Dr. Emmon's analysis, in 100 parts of the 
 ashes of the sap-wood of the apple tree, there are three ele- 
 ments that greatly preponderate : 16 parts potash, 17 parts 
 phosphate of lime, and 18 parts lime. In the bark of this 
 tree there are 4 parts potash, and 51 parts lime. 

100 parts of the ashes of tho sap-wood of the pear tree, 
 show 23 parts potash, 27 parts of»phospiiate of liine, and 12 
 parts of lime; the bark giving 6 parts of potash, G parts of 
 phosphate, and 30 parts of lime. 

The analysis of the common wild grape-vine shows 20 
 parts of potash, 15 parts phosphate of lime, and 17 parts 
 lime to 100 parts; the bark giving 1 part potash, 5 parts 
 phosphate of lime, and 30 parts of lime. 

Now, no intelligent cultivator can ex.amine these results 
 (which we have given thus in the rough to simplify tho 
 matter) without being conscious at a glance that this largo 
 necessity existing in the fruit trees for potash, phosphate of 
 lime, and lime, is not at all provided for by the common 
 system of manuring orchards. Hence, in certain soils, 
 where a part or all of these elements naturally exist, wo 
 see both the finest fruit and extraordinary proihictivcness in 
 the orchards. In other soils, well suited perhaps for many 
 other crops, orchards languish and are found unprofitable. 

More than this. Dr. Emmons has pointed out what is per- 
 haps known to few of our readers, that these inorganic sub- 
 stances form, as it were, the skeleton or bones of all vegeta- 
 bles as they do more tangibly in animals. The bones of 
 animals are lime — in the form of phosphate and carbonate 
 —and the frailer net-work skeleton of trunks, loaves, and 
 fibres in plants, is formed of precisely the same substance. 
 The bark, the veins and nerves of the leaves, the skin of 
 fruit, are all formed upon a frame-work of this organised 
 salt of lime, which, in the growth of the plant is taken up 
 from the soil, and circulates freely in the outer extremities 
 of the tree or plant in all directions. 

As these elements, which we have named as forming so 
 largo a part of tho ashes of plants, are found in animal ma- 
 nures, the latter are quite sufficient in soils where they are 
 not naturally deficient. But, on the other hand, where the 
 soil is wanting in lime, potash, and phosphate of lime, com- 
 mon manures will not and do not answer the purpose. Ex- 
 perience has abundantly proved the latter position; and sci- 
 ence has at length pointed out the cause of the failure. 

The remedy is simple enough. Lime, potash, and bones 
 (which latter abound in the phosphate) are cheap materials, 
 easily obtained in any part of the country. If they are not 
 at hand, common wood ashes, which contains all of them, is 
 an easy substitute, and one which may be used in much lar- 
 ger quantities than is commonly applied, with the most de- 
 cided benefit to all fruit trees. 

The more scientific cultivator of fruit will not fail, how- 
 ever, to observe that there is a very marked difierence in the 
 proportion of these inorganic matters in the ashes of the 
 trees under our notice. Thus, potash and phosphate of lime 
 enter much more largely into the composition of the pear 
 than they do in that of the apple tree ; while lime is much 
 more abundant in the apple than in the pear; the ashes cf 
 the bark of the apple tree being more than half lime. Pot- 
 ash and lime are also found to be the predominant elements 
 of the inorganic structure of the grapo-vine. 

Hence potash and bone-dust will be the principal sub- 
 stances to nourish the structure of tho pear tree : lime, the 
 principal substance for the apple; and potash for the grapo- 
 vine ; though each of tho others is also highly essential. 

Since these salts of lime penetrate to the remotest ex- 
 tremities of the tree; since, indeed, they arc the foundation 
 upon which a healthy structure of all the other parts must 
 rest, it appears to us a rational deduction, that upon their 
 presence, in sufficient quantity, must depend largely the 
 general healthy condition of the leaves and fruit. Hence, 
 it is not unlikely that certain diseases of fruit, known a.s the 
 '•bitter rot" in apples, the "mildew" in grapes, and '■crncl-- 
 ing" in pears, known and confined to certain districts <if tho 
 country, may arise from a deficiency of those inorganic ele- 
 ments in tho soil of those districts (not overlonking suli)bato 
 of iron, so marked in it-s effects on tbe health of foliage). 
 Careful experiment will det-ermine this; and if such should 
 prove to be the caco, one of the greatest ohrtacle< to iiuivcr- 
 s.al orchard culture will be easily removed.* What we have 
 hero endeavored to convoy of tho importance of certain 
 specific marures for fruit tree?, is by uo n.eiais all theory.
