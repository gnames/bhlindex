THE FARM JOURXAL, 

[April 

We could already give numerous prnctical illustrations to 
 fortify it. Two will perhaps suffice for the present. 

Tho irroafest oreliard in America, umU'niablj', i.s that at 
 Pelh;nii firm, on the Hudson. How many barrels of apples 
 are raised there annually, we are not informed. But we do 
 know that the crop numbered several thousand barrels of 
 Newtown pippins, of a size, flavor, and beauty that wo nev- 
 er saw surpassed; and second, that the Pelham Newtown 
 pippins are as well known in Covent Garden Market, Lon- 
 don, as a Bank of England note, and can as readily bo turn- 
 ed into cash, with the highest premium over any other goods 
 and chattels of the like ilescription. Now the great secret 
 of the orchard culture at the Polha,m farm, is the abundant 
 use of lime. Not that high culture and plenty of other ne- 
 cessary food are wanting ; but that lime is the great basis of 
 large crops, and smooth, high-flavored fruit. 

Again, the greatest dilRculty in fruit culture in America, 
 is to grow the foreign grtipe in the open air. It is not heat 
 uor fertility that is wanting, for one section or another of 
 the country can give both these in perfection; biit in all sec- 
 tions the fruit mildews, and is, on the whole, worthless. An 
 intelligent cultivator, living in a warm and genial corner of 
 Canada AVest, (bordering on the west part of Lake Erie,) 
 had been more than usually successful for several seasons in 
 maturing several varieties of grapes in the open air. At 
 length they began to fail — even upon the young vines — and 
 the mildew made its appearance to render nearly the whole 
 crop worthless. Last season, this gentleman, following a 
 hint in this journal, gave one of his grape borders a heavy 
 dressing of wood ashes. These ashes contained, of course, 
 both the potash and the lime, so necessary to the grape. He 
 had the satisfaction of raising, this season, a crop of fair 
 and excellent grapes (of which we had oecular proof) from 
 this border, while the other vines of the same age, (and 
 treated, otherwise, in the same way,) bore only mildewed 
 and worthless fruit. We consider both these instances ex- 
 cellent illustrations of the value of specific manures. 

We promise to return to this subject again. In the mean- 
 time it may not be useless to caution some of our readers 
 against pursuing the wholesale course with specifics which 
 all the quack doctors are so fond of recommending — i. e. 
 "If a thing is good, you cannot give too much." A tree is 
 not all bones, and therefore something must bo considered 
 besides its anatomical structure — important as they may be. 
 The good, old-fashioned, substantial nourishment must not 
 be withheld, and a suitable ration from the compost or ma- 
 nure heap, as usual, will by no moans prevent our orchards 
 being benefitted all the more by the substances of which 
 they have especial need, in certain points of their organiza- 
 tion. — Iforticultun'st. 

"••• It will be remembered that, in our work on Fruits, we op- 
 posed the theory that all the old pears, liable to crack along 
 the seaeoast, and in some other sections of the country, 
 were "worn out." A7e attributed their apparent decline to 
 unfavorable soil, injudicious culture, and ungenial climate. 
 A good deal of observation since these views were publish- 
 ed, has convinced us that "cracking in the pear is to be at- 
 tributed more to an exhaustion, or a want of certain neces- 
 sary elements in the soil, than to any other cause. Age has 
 little or nothing to do with it, since Van 3fons Leon Le 
 Olcrc, one of the newest and most vigorous of pears, has 
 cracked in some soils for the past two years around Boston, 
 though perfectly fair in other soils there, and in the inte- 
 rior. 

The Oyster Crop of Baltimore. 

According to "The Baltimore American," the product of the 
 oyster trade of the city is ecjual to, or greater than the product 
 of all the wheat and corn raised in the State of Maryland. The 
 whole shores of the Chesapeake Bay audits tributaries are 
 adapted to the growth of the oyster, and as but one year is 
 required for their full growth, an immense profit accrues to 
 those engaged in the business — a profit which is estimated at 
 some three hundred to six hundi-ed per cent. There are 250 
 vessels engaged in the business, which average about 900 
 bushels to the cargo, and require nine or ten days to the trip. 
 These vessels, making in the aggregate 6,000 trips during the 
 eight months in which they are engaged give atotal of 4,800,- 
 000 bushels per year sold in the Baltimore market. The oys- 
 ters bring an average price of 50 cents per bushel, which gives 
 a grand total of $2,400,000 per year paid for oysters by the 
 .dealers in the city. Some of the houses send by the JBalti- 

more and Ohio and Baltimore and Susquehanna Rasilroads, 
 to say nothing of the other modes of tranportatujn, from 8 
 to twelve tons of "cauned" oysters per day. The shells are 
 carried for manure, to all parts of Virginia and North Caroli- 
 na. In the shucking of oysters, the shells will increase about 
 one-forth, which would give a total of about 6,000,000 Inishels 
 of shells, which sell for two cents per bushel, making a re- 
 turn of $120,000 per year for the shells alone, 

Charcoal Bust for Potatoes. 

The antiseptic porperties of charcal are well known. 
 Since the prevalence of the polatoe disease, it has frequently 
 been recommended as a preventive of the rot, and many ex- 
 periments have been recorded, showing a satisfactory result; 
 Wo have ourselves used the small dust from coal heaps for 
 this purpose, with success. In the "Survej- of Essex County," 
 Mr. Whallon gives the following testimony to the value of 
 coal dust. After speaking of its value as a maure for wheat, 
 and particularly for grass, he saj's : — "I have also vised the 
 dust on loamy and intervale laud with the potatoe crop. 
 During the series of years in which the rot almost ruined the 
 potatoe crop, I scarcely lost any potatoes from that cause, 
 and supposed it was owing to the coal dust I used. My man- 
 ner has been to drop the seed and cover it with a small shov- 
 el full of dust, and then cover with earth. Have any of our 
 readers used it, and with what success ? — Rural Neic- York- 

Cutting' and Grinding Corn Stalks. 

Vfm. G. Huyett, of Williamsburg, Pa., has invented an 
 improvement in machines for the above purpose, on which he 
 has applied for a patent. His invention consists in the em- 
 ployment of a revolving cutting knife iu combination with a 
 revolving disc, both secured on the same shaft, and revolving 
 simultaneously. The knife is of such a shape, and is so ar- 
 ranged in relation to the feed hopper and grinding disc, that 
 it serves to cut up the stalks and prepare them and feed them 
 to the grinding disc, which turns in a toothed concave, grind- 
 ing them as fast as cut. If this machine should work well 
 it will be a v'^ry useful invention. — Sci. Am. 

Nitrate of Soda. 

The American ^IflrVcif/fiin'sf copies our account of Mr. II. 
 Shubart's experiments with nitrate of soda and guano on 
 corn, and earnestly appeals to farmers to make accurate ex- 
 periments with the nitrate, saying that it has a good deal of 
 confidence in the idea that nitrate of Soda will soon be a 
 successful competitor against monopolized guano, we trust 
 the experiment wil! be made, though we have but faint hope 
 that the idea of the A<jriciiUurint will prove cerrect: The 
 value of the guano consists in containing much ammonia ; 
 the value of the nitrate in containing much nitric acid, and 
 it is supposed that the latter will afford nitrogen to plants 
 as well as the former. This may be true. AVe think how- 
 ever; the chief value of ammonia is not in supplying the 
 plants with nitrogen, but in organizing starch, or in depos- 
 iting silicic acid on the stalks of corn or wheat, &c. If this 
 view is correct, nitric acid can never take the place of am- 
 monia in the vegetable organism, uor nitrate of soda com- 
 pete with guano, as a manure for the cereals. — [Rural New 
 Yorker. 

Profits of a Vine. 
 A late paper gives a statement of the cost and profits of an 
 Isabella grape vine. The cost is twenty-five cents in labor 
 yearlj', in pruning and dressing, and one wheel-barrow load 
 of manure. The profits are five to six bushels of grapes an- 
 nually, and an ornamental effect in covering an otherwise 
 unsightly out-house. 

Fresh Isabella Grapes in January.' 

We are indebted to Geo. Clapp, Esq., of Auburn, N. Y., for 
 a box of Delicious Isabella grapes, raised from his grapery 
 last season, and preserved in cotton up to this time. The 
 specimens sent us were as fresh and retained their flavor as 
 perfectly as though just plucked from the vine. It may in- 
 terest some of our readers to know the process by which they 
 were preserved, which was simply by placing the clusters be- 
 tween layers of cotton, in a box, until it was full, and then 
 covering it, to exclude the air much as possible. — Sci. Am.
