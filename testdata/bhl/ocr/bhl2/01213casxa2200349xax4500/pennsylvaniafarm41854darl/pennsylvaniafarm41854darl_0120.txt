diced geatleman here; and although it la tho first chicken 
 show Gotham has evor seen, I sincerely hope it will not be 
 the last, and when the next one happens may we all be here 
 to see. 

At Albany I .asserted that the lova of birds was a tie of 
 brotherhood. In the discuasion that is to follow, I hope the 
 sentiment will not be belied. I have an instance in mind 
 that fully illustrates its truth. It relates to my first ac- 
 fiuaintanoe with Dr. James M'Clintock, ex-Pro.sident of the 
 Pennsylvania Poultry Society. With your permission, sir, 
 I will mention it. One fine morning in Juno, 1S52, I was 
 taking a walk on the shady side of Market street in Phila- 
 delpliia, as usunl looking out for chickens, I came to a well 
 known stand, and there I beheld "a tall, short, slim, thick- 
 set man" with a big head, and a dii^estivc apparatus to 
 match, standing before a coop, examining tho contents by 
 the rules and pictures of a book which he held in his hand. 
 Never hesitating a moment to address a poultry fancier, I 
 tapped him gently on the shoulder, and asked him if that 
 was a chicken l)ook. Ho said it was, and added "who are 
 you?" I told him my name. ''P>y Shanghais and thun- 
 der!" he exclaimed, "I thought so." He had read some vff- 
 ticles I had written on the ."ubject, and it struck him tliey 
 looked like mc. You will have to infer, gentleman, they 
 were prettj' tnU articles. To deter you from reading them I 
 will s.ay they were nearly as long as myself. Says he, 
 "come over and take a drink." "Yes," I told him, "I would 
 not take a drink, but I would go over." I did so, and in less 
 than five minutes we were as thick as flies on a stump-tail 
 horse in the dog days, and have remained so ever since. I 
 trust the same good fellowship may never cease to exist 
 among us all, and when we scatter to our widely separated 
 homes, may we carry with us a friendship for each that will 
 not abate, but grow as strong and endearing as our love for 
 Shanghais ! 

Guano Deposits on the CMncha Islands. 

We cull from the London Chroiiielo, the following valua- 
 ble abstract of the official report, made on a careful examina- 
 tion of the actu.al amount of guano remaining in the Chincha 
 Islands. It has evidently been compiled after a careful 
 scrutiny, and a minimum estimate is the result. It exceeds in 
 reality double the quantity roughly obtained by Admiral 
 Morsby, b it is below that of private persons engaged in 
 the ti-ade. 

Peruvian Legation, 4 Albemarle st., | 
 Piccadilly, February 7, 1854. J 

A note has been received at the above Legation, from the 
 Minister of Finance of the Republic, bearing date of the 
 24th of December, in which the undermentioned is commu- 
 nicated to the Charge d'Affairs : — 

The government nominated a deputation, composed of 
 Mr. Charles Faraguet, a French engineer, in the service of 
 Peru, and many other engineers and professors of Chemistry, 
 native as well as foreign, in orderthat they might undertake 
 the measurment of the guano of the Chinca Islands. 

This, therefore, has been effected by men best qualified 
 for the purpose, with as much accuracy as could possibly be 
 obtained, adopting the latest improvements in the scientific 
 proceedings, and the following result has been given in 
 conformity : Tons. 

That the island situated at tho north contains 4,189,477 

That the centre island contains, 2,505,948 

That the south island contains 5,630,675 

Or a total of 12,376,100 

The computation is for toiis mcasurmeiu, which, when re- 
 duced to tons toefght — the standard used in the sale — will in- 
 ea-ease the quantity to 16,601,406 tons weight of saleable 

guano. Besides the Chinca Islands, it is well known that 
 Peru possesses many other guano deposits, containing a 
 very considerable quantity, the measurement of which has 
 also been ordered by tho government, and will be published 
 in due course. 

It will be seen that the estimate is about double Ihatmade 
 by Admiral More.<by, of the British Navy, and heretofore 
 published in the Farm Journal.

 ^^S~[The following verses, written by Mrs. Francis D. 
 Gage, for the Ohio Cultivator will answer as well in Penn- 
 sylvania, as in the Buckeye State:] 

Ben Fisher had finished his harvesting. 

And he stood by the orchard gate, 
 One foot on the rail and one on the ground. 

As he called to his good wife — Kate. 
 There were stains of toils on his manly hand. 

The du^t of the field on his hat. 
 But a twinkle of j)leasuro was in his eye 
 As he looked on his stock so fat. 

"Here, give me that baby, dear Kate, 3'ou are tired, 

I fear you have too much care. 
 You must rest and pick up a little; I think. 

Before we go to the fair. 
 I'd hate to be taking fat oxen, you know, 

Fat Hogs, and fat sheep, and fat cows. 
 With a wife at my elbows as poor as a crow. 

And care wrinkles shading her brow." 
 "Can't go," did you say? "Can't afford the expense," 

I know, Kate, our crops ain't the best, 
 But we've labored together to keep things along, 

And together we'll now take a rest. 
 The orchard is bare, but old brindle is prime, 

And Lilly and Fan are a show. 
 Your butter and cheese can't be beat in the State, 

So up to the fair we will go." i 

Y^ou've ne'er seen a city, and Cleveland is fine. 

Ne'er seen the blue billowy Lake, 
 Ne'er rode in a rail car, nor been in a throng, 

So K.ate, thisjourney we'll take. 
 And garner new feelings, new thoughts and new ways. 

If wo find those that suit as we roam. 
 And garner up strength with our head, heart and hands, 

For the love and duties of home. 

"I have sometimes thought, Kate, as I plodded along. 

For months, o'er the same weary round. 
 That a fellow who had such a really hard time. 

In Ohio nowhere could be found, 
 But when I've been called from my home for awhile, 

And seen how the rest get along, * 

I've some back to my toil with a light cheerful heart. 

And, "there's no place like home," was my song. 

"I wonder that mothers don't whoUy despair. 

Who ne'er from their cares get away. 
 But walk the same tread-wheel of duty for years, 

Scarce stopping to rest night ordaj^. 
 I don't wonder they grow discontented sometimes. 

That their feelings grow raspy and cold. 
 For toil never-ending, and labor uncheered. 

Makes women — and men sometimes scold." , 

Kate looked up with a smile, and said, "Ben, we will go, 

There may be better oxen than ours. 
 Horses swifter on foot and finer by far. 

Better butter and cheese, fruit and flowers. 
 But there's one thing I claim I know can't be boat 

In the whole Yankee nation to-day, 
 I'd not swap him, I know, for a kingdom to boot, 
 That's my "gude man," and Kate ran away."

Hint to Dairy Maids. 
 It is said that when a cow refuses to give down her 
 milk, by placing a sack of grain, or other weight on her 
 back, the power to hold up is overcome, and the milk 
 will flow. Will some of our dairymen try this, and in- 
 foi'm us of its cori'ectness.
