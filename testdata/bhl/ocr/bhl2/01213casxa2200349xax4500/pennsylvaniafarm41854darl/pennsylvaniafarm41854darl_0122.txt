itself by discliaiges of blood, both from the kidneys and 
 bowels. We pi'ocured two ounces of saltpetre, dissolved 
 it in a quart of wai-ni water, stirred in half pound of 
 ginger, and gave as a drench; and in one liour after we 
 drenched him with a mixture of a quart of thin molas- 
 ses and finely pulverised charcoal, sufficiently thin to 
 pom-. This being done after night, he was left till 
 morning, when he appeared somewhat better, and eat a 
 little corn meal. We next gave him a tea cup full of 
 turpentine, with a like quantity of melted lard. Three 
 01" fours after we made a strong tea of cedar branches, 
 (berries on,) and drenched him with it freely. 

The discharges of blood by this time were evidently 
 stopped, but the next day it was observed he had no 
 passages, and we gave him a pound of Epsom salts in 3 
 lialf pints of warm water, which soon carried off a quan- 
 tity of clotted blood that had collected; since when 
 there has been no signs of the complaint, and the animal 
 appears to perfectly cured. 

I lost a number of cattle by murrain some years ago, 
 aud this is the second I have succeeded in curing. The 
 first one was cured by two drenches named above, but as 
 this one seemed a bad case I thought best to make use 
 of the other means. It appears to be important to give 
 the m.edicine in tlie early stage of the complaint.

Large vs. Small Trees for Transplanting. 
 Messrs. Editors : — As the regular season for trans- 
 planting trees is at hand, I will, with your compliance, 
 address a few remarks to your readers, which, if they 
 do no good can do no harm. I would say to all who 
 purchase trees to plant, that they need hardly expect to 
 live so long as to see these trees at full growth, so I ad- 
 vise them to purchase the largest trees in the nurseries 
 that they can get. There is as little risk in transplanting 
 large nursery trees as there is with small ones ; if large 
 trees cannot be got then plant small ones ; do not wait 
 another year for them to be larger, get them at once and 
 have them properly planted, and they will grow as mvich 
 on your own places as they will do in the nurseries. 
 Bome say that small trees, planted at the same time as 
 large ones, Avill be as large as the large ones in five or 
 six years. Now they do not believe this themselves. 
 Then why deceive the public ? The truth is this : A 
 large tree, planted at the same time as a small one, will 
 be as much larger than the small one in five, ten or 
 twenty years as it is now; and I say this from practical 
 experience. Very few have planted as many trees as I 
 have done, and all our Philadelphia nurserymen know 
 that I always select their largest trees. Now for proofs: 
 In the years 1836, '37 and '38, I planted some seven 
 hundred trees of different kinds, the largest that could 
 be got in the nurseries. This was on the banks of the 
 Hudson, and the trees were nearly all got from Mr. 
 Prince, of Flushing, as he had the largest we could get, 
 and on the same jilace and at the same time, four hundred 
 small trees were planted, and when I saw them last year 
 those which v/ere largest when planted had even gained 
 a great deal on the small ones. When the stock of the 
 "Old Landreth Nurseries" was sold out, I think seven 
 years ago, I purchased over two hundred of the largest 
 trees of different kinds for a gentleman, and took them 

out into the country and planted them that spring. Not 
 one failed, and those that were smallest then are small- 
 est yet. When Mr. Buist sold out the stock of his nur- 
 sery down the ''Neck," three years ago, I purchased 
 about two hundi-ed and fifty of the largest trees of dif- 
 ferent kinds, (and some of them were very large,) for two 
 gentlemen, and had them taken out into the country and 
 planted. Not one of them failed. The largest then are 
 largest now. 

After giving these proofs, does any one yet believe 
 that the small trees will match the large ones in size in 
 a few years. It is a delusion. Never mind the cost of 
 a tree; get the largest in the nurseries, and get a proper 
 person to plant them. Do not wait till fall or next year, 
 get them now. Remember that next year your life is a 
 year shorter ; so take the pleasui-e of the world while 
 you are in it. A tree, bush or vine, are things to look 
 at, and are always gaining in size, and if they are fruit 
 bearing then you Avill taste their products the sooner. So 
 do not "put off till to-morrow what should be done to- 
 day." To-morrow will bring its cares along with it. 

Respectfully' yours,

FIG. 1. riG. 2. 

No. 1. — Black Tartarian. — This superb fruit has 
 already become a general favorite in all our gai'dens ; 
 and in size, flavor, and productiveness, it has no superi- 
 or among black cherries. It is a Russian and West 
 Asian variety, introduced into England about 179G, and 
 brought thence to this country about twenty years ago. 
 It is remarkable for its rapid, vigorous growth, large 
 leaves, and the erect habit of its head. The fruit ripens ^^ 
 about the middle of June, a few days after the May- 
 duke. 

Fruit of the largest size, heart-shaped, (sometimes 
 rather obtuse, ) irregular and uneven on the surface. 
 Skin glossy, bright purplish black. Flesh purplish, 
 thick, (the stone being quite small,) half-tender, and 
 juicy. Flesh very rich and delicious.
