 or unfortunate management in some waj-. 

A reaper trial is not like a horse race, where the sole 
 object is to beat, regardless of everything except the 
 coming out ahead ; it is, or ought to be, to ascertain 
 gurely which is the best machine, and not so much to 
 benefit the owner, as the farmers, who wish to know 
 what kind to buy. 

How absurd is it for any set of men — I care not how 
 great their experience and judgment — to take from three 
 ,to a dozen reapers, perhaps all of acknowledged merit, 
 and by the cutting of two acres each, as was done at the 
 Woostei', Ohio, trial where mine was defeated ; or even 
 by cutting five or six acres as at the Richmond, Indiana, 
 ti-ial where mine was victor, decide positively and abso- 
 lutely that one reaper is better than all others. 

Such a trial might siiow v.'he'her a reaper wonld work 
 or not, but to judge between rival reapers, of which 
 there ai-e over twenty of established reputation, each 
 having its points of excellence ; a long and thorough 
 trial must be requisite, to see how they work in diifercnt 
 kinds of grain, and under varied circumstances, and how 
 they w^ear. A trial to be decisive should go through an 
 entire harvest. One, too, that was thorough and relia- 
 ble, would be equally available in one State as another. 
 They are also expensive to all concerned. I would, 
 therefore, propose a general trial on something like the 
 following plan : 

Let several State Agricultural Societies unite, each 
 appropriating $200 to $500, and appointing one or two 
 committee men, in whose experience, judgment and fair- 
 ness, entire confidence could be placed. Let the com- 
 mittee make their arrangements as early as possible, 
 adopt their rules, and appoint time and place of first 
 meeting. They might begin South and proceeding North 
 continue the trial for weeks if necessary, leaving out one 
 machine after another as its inferiority became mani- 
 fest. 

The committee should have all their expenses paid, 
 and perhaps compensation besides ; and the cost of re- 
 moving reapers from place to place might also be borne 
 by the committee, in order to enable every builder to 
 come into the trial ; and for this reason I would not re- 
 quire any entrance fee, though some of the larger build- 
 ers would doubtless be willing to contribute to the gen- 
 eral fund. If five or more societies can be got to iinite 
 in such a trial, I will contribute $200 to $500, or as 
 much as any otlier builder. 

The surplus funds should be divided to the best ma- 
 chines, say half to the first, one-third to the second, and 
 one-sixth to the third, to be paid in plate or money as 
 might be desired by the winner. 

To save tinic and expedite arrangements, I would sug- 
 gest to parties interested to correspond with Col. B. P. 
 Johnson, Secretary New Yoi"k State Agricultural Socie- 
 ty, Albany, New York. I have not communicated with 
 lum, but am quite sure his interest in agricultural mat- 
 ters will cause him to bear the labors with cheerfulness.

I planted out in my nursery last year, which have been ex- 
 posed out all winter without any protection. This is some 
 evidence that they will stand the cold of an ordinary 
 winter in this latitude. The plants are about 18 inches 
 high, and appear to be very little affected, except at the 
 extremity of the branches. Respectfully,

 CHEAT. 

Mr. Editor: — Some persons entertain the opinion 
 that wheat and rye turn into cheat. Such an opinion is 
 contrary to the injunction that every herb should bring 
 forth seed after its own kind. As an illustration of this 
 I will state that, about twenty years ago, a farmer of 
 Montgomery county had some wheat that had a great 
 deal of cheat in it, which he took out by putting the 
 wheat into water, in which case the cheat floated on the 
 surface — this was taken ofi^ and thrown into a hollow 
 that was always too wet to produce vegetation — after it 
 had lain there seven years the hollow was cleaned out, 
 and the dirt spread on a field. Mr. B did not ex- 
 pect that the cheat would grow, but to his great sur- 
 prise, when he put in a crop that was favorable to the 
 growth of cheat, it grew thickly, and thus it continued to 
 do for eleven years, although not a head of it was al- 
 lowed to get ripe. Thus he clearly proved that if cheat 
 be confined under mud and water seven years, and then 
 kept in the ground buried too deeply to germinate for 
 eleven more, it will grow when it is brought near the 
 surface by the plow or otherwise. Hence it may be 
 inferred that cheat retains the vital oil probably longer 
 than any other seed, though, perhaps, not in all situa- 
 tions. The singular property of cheat has induced many 
 farmers to think their wheat turned into cheat, because 
 cheat has grown where they sowed clean seed, not sus- 
 pecting that the seed of cheat will lie several years in 
 the ground and then grow. 

Since the above discovery, Mr. B has always been 

very careful to have his seed clean, and now he has 
 scarcely a stalk of cheat growing on his land. Although 
 his wheat has sometimes been very much hurt by the 
 winter, &c., yet no cheat grew in the place of it. Where 
 wheat fails the cheat has a better chance to grow, and it 
 there makes the greatest appearance ; but if it be close- 
 ly examined, there will be no more roots found there 
 than elsewhere, (other circumstances being the same,) 
 but they will be larger and produce more heads. But 
 where there is neither cheat sowed nor any in the 
 ground, the grass will grow much more where the wheat 
 tails; thei'efore, it would be as reasonable to say, that 
 wheat changed to timothy as to cheat. J. S. G.

 THE FARMER. 
 Mr. Editor : — No man, one would think, Avould feel 
 so sensibly his immediate dependance upon God as the 
 farmer. For all his peculiar blessings he is invited to 
 look immediately to the bounty of Heaven. No secon- 
 dary cause stands between him and his maker. To him 
 are essential the regular succession of the seasons, and 
 the timely fall of the rain, the genial warmth of the sun,
