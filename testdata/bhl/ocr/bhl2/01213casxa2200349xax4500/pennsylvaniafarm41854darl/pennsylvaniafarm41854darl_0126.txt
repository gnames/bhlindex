to inform the Major that it is not all a bed of sand. 

Last season I raised ninety-five busliels of clean Rye 
 on five and a half acres of ground. Some of the straw 
 measured six feet long after it was cradled. Also three 
 pecks of small ISIercer potatoes yielded sixty bushels of 
 good potatoes. I would like to hear of Mr. Freas rais- 
 ing that amount on a mere sand bed.

Leipsic, Dec. 28th, 1853. 

!Mb. Editor : — The cold Russian blasts that s^eep 
 over the ground as it is white with snow, having 
 shut up the last remnants of vegetation, there is not 
 much left here for the farmer to look at by way of ob- 
 serving crops, or the means resorted to to raise and 
 gather them from the fields. Nor do I suppose the op- 
 portunities for siich observation are much better in your 
 part of the land of the "stars and strii^es." But this is 
 the proper season of the year for the farmer to read, 
 and I can wish him nothing worse than that some of the 
 scores of excellent works on agriculture that throng the 
 Leipsic book market, were well translated, and in his 
 hands, to be read during the long winter evenings that 
 now pass away. Books written by scientific men and 
 university graduates, who carry on or superintend the 
 practical operations of large tracts of land. Thus com- 
 bining theory and an intelligent practice. 

It is true we have several of Liebig's works on agri- 
 culture translated, but they are generally old before 
 they reach the farmer. They do not contain the latest 
 observations and experiments in the science of agricul- 
 ture. 

Here, on the contrary, a man who wants to get the 
 latest scientific investigation on the subject of farming, 
 never pretends to get an edition of a book more than 
 one or two years old. We can depend upon the present 
 year for an abundance of reading matter from the high- 
 est au^thorities in the world, almost as confidently as he 
 can that he will not be obliged to substitute last year's 
 almanac for this year. 

From a work on the history of Chemistry, embracing 
 over 2000 pages, which has lately appeared, and which 
 now lies on my table, I propose extracting the history of 
 lime, which I think may not bo uninteresting to the far- 
 mers who read your Journal. 

If there is any class of people who, particularly more 
 thaja others, should be made familiar with the history of 
 lime, it is the people of Chester and its adjoining coun- 
 ties. 

The persevering in;iustry that has marked tlieir course 
 in liming, through a long series of years, has few, if 
 any, parallels south of the Hudson. This may seem an 
 extravagant assertion, but when we look at the wide and 
 deep excavations that her quarries present, when we 
 see the difficulties of quarrying in many of them, (large 
 quantities of earth to remove from the top of the stone 
 which, when it is reached, is enveloped in vrater, which 

must be pumped or drained oiF,) and lastly, when we 
 consider that a large proportion of the material excava- 
 ted has been hauled, without the aid of steam, twelve, 
 fifteen or twenty miles ; that much of the wood that was 
 used to burn it has been by the same means hauled an 
 equal distance ; that gneiss formations and mica slate 
 fields have, by hauling this distance, been brought al- 
 most by lime .alone, (by lime and such vegetable matter as 
 started into existence by the action of lime,) from what 
 has been deemed in other parts of the Union hopeless 
 poverty to luxuriant gardens, equaling in tlie amoiint of 
 their productions the alluvial soils of the Mississippi val- 
 ley, I repeat when all these things are considered, we 
 may well repeat the question, where do you, in the use 
 of lime, find a parallel. Almost the first question with 
 a large proportion of our farmers, when they are going 
 to purchase land is, "how far is it from lime ?" while 
 there are hundreds of farmers in the United States that 
 do not know lime is used as a fertilizer at all, and thou- 
 sands there are who have never seen a bu^'hcl of it appli- 
 ed to this purpose : and even further, there are hun- 
 dreds of people in the Mississippi valley who don't know 
 that stable manure has any fertilizing properties about 
 it. They are ignorant of it for the same reason that 
 many intelligent farmers are ignorant of the chemical 
 character and constitution of lime. Simply because 
 mother necessity has not required them to learn it. 
 Thus much in reply to an anticii^ated remark, that too 
 much importance was attached to the perseverance of 
 Chester county farmers in the use of lime. The devel- 
 opments of time may show, and for the sake of the fu- 
 ture I hope they may, that much less lime might have 
 sufficed had it been used in connection with other agents 
 required by the soil. But this part of the subject we 
 will pass over for the present to enter upon the history 
 already alluded to. In translating it, the aim will be to 
 get at the idea more than to make a literal translation, 
 and to introduce such parenthetical remarks as may 
 seem necessary to make it understood by farmers, and 
 those who are not chemists, for whose reading the work 
 is more particularly adapted. 

After devoting several pages to the history of potash 
 and soda, and the first ideas the ancients had of ashes 
 and the causticity of the same, the author goes on to re- 
 mark : 

"That the early application of lime to making mortar, 
 for the purposes of building, is the most remote period 
 to which we can trace the history of the practice of 
 burning lime. 

"The first authors who gave any definite information 
 on the subject of lime burning, and the changes that 
 common limestone undergoes, by which it is converted 
 iiato burnt or caustic lime, were Diascorides and Pliny. 
 (Diascorides was a physician of Asia Minor, Avho flour- 
 ished in the middle of the first century ; he wrote five 
 books on medicine, that are recognised as authority to 
 this day by the Turkish physicians ; he was also the au- 
 thor of several discoveries in chemistry. Pliny — the 
 greatest writer in natviral history — the author of 37 
 books, 4 of which were devoted to chemistry. He was 
 smothci'cd in an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A. D. 79. 
 He became so absorbed in the phenomena of the burn- 
 ing mountain that, forgetting Lis cwn safety, he was en-
