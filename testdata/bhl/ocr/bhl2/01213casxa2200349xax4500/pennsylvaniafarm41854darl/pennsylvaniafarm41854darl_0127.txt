Disascorides remarked thus eai-ly that caustic lime 
 could be obtained from oyster shells, by heating them 
 till they became perfectly white. It could also be ob- 
 tained by heating limestone or marble. 

It is supposed that the ancients obtained their first 
 ideas of causticity from obserying burnt lime, (which, of 
 coui'se, was long before it was definitely described.) 
 This author says it is a fiery, hot caustic substance, and 
 its causticity is particularly dwelt upon, as a peculiarity 
 by which it may be distinguished. 

Paulis Agineta, a great Greek physician of the 7th 
 century, who wrote seven books on medicine, spoke of 
 the use of caustic lime to prepare caustic potash or soda. 
 Ke says the wash- water from ordinary ashes is called 
 ley. but when this ley is mi.xed with a solution of lime 
 water it changes its character, becomes caustic, and is 
 called caustic ley. (This phenomenon, so long ago ob- 
 served, is thus explained : Common ley holds in solution 
 potash and soda, in unison with a substance called car- 
 bonic acid, which latter substance is formed from the 
 decomposition of the vegetable juices in burning wood ; 
 when lime in solution is added to the ley it takes this 
 carbonic acid from the potash and soda, and leaves them 
 caustic, while it in the operation loses its causticity, and 
 becomes mild (or carbonate of) lime or common lime- 
 stone. 

Any one can see this re-action take place if they 
 will add a little solution of clear lime water to ordinary 
 ley, that has been "run off" without any lime in the 
 ashes. The mild lime or limestone formed being insolu- 
 ble in the ley solution, will settle down as a white pow- 
 der to the bottom of the vessel.) 

But previous to the time of Paulis Agineta, the 
 Egyptian and Arabian Alchemists were familiar with the 
 effect of caustic lime upon the ley of ashes. (All chem- 
 ists previous to the 17th century are called alchemists. 
 They date their origin not far from the christian era. 
 They were at first principally Arabians, but finally 
 spread into Egypt, from Egypt to Greece, and then 
 Rome, and finally from the 13th to the 17th century all 
 over Europe. All their investigations were based upon 
 a most palpable absurdity, which they assumed as a fix- 
 ed fact, viz : That there was such a thing in existence as 
 the "Philosopher's Stone," or "Stone of the Wise," 
 which, when brought in contact with the gross metals as 
 iron, tin, &c., while the latter were in a melted state, 
 would instantly transform them into gold. And to find 
 this stone almost the entire labor of the alchemists were 
 directed for over 800 years. Every conceivable sub- 
 stance was sought for it to no purpose, except it was to 
 stumble upon a great many facts of importance that 
 were not at all anticipated in the outset.) 

Theophrastus, a pupil of ib-istotle and Plato, said, 300 
 years before Christ, that gypsum (sulphate of lime or 
 common plaster) might be more of the nature of a stone 
 than an earth, (an earth being a substance "insoluble in 
 water and infusible.") He wondered what was the cause 
 of its warmth when moistened. He spoke of its property 
 of consolidating after being wet, and said that it must 
 be used as soon as made, as it soon becomes solid. He 
 considered it had some relation to lime. 

Diascorides said nothing about the efi"ect of water on 

lime, yet he must have observed it, because he called the 
 caustic .lime "uuslacked." 

Pliny says expressly that it dissolves readily iu wat- 
 er. 

But the real nature of the change, which takes place 
 in limestone imder high temperatures by which it is con- 
 verted in carbonate of lime, was not till a much later 
 period understood. This change as now known is thus 
 shown, 

(Lime, plus Carbonic Acid,) is Limcstome. 
 by heating, this carbonic acid, amounting to nearly half 
 its weight, passes off at the top of the kiln and leaves 
 (Lime, plus nothing, or Bui-nt Lime. 

For a long time they considered the caustic and the 
 mild alkalies, as caustic potash and soda, and their car- 
 ):)onate3 as substances only differing very slightly from 
 each other. 

For instance, Geber said, in his writings on this sub- 
 ject, that sal alkali (the alkaline substances now Imown 
 to consist of soda and potash,) was prepared in two dif- 
 ferent ways ; by one way it was prepared from soda, and 
 he gave a method to make it, but the substance really 
 made was crystalized carbonate of soda ; by the other 
 method it was made from wood ashes, and the substance 
 made was carbonate of potash. 

Thus were two different substances made by different 
 means, from different materials, considered as one and 
 the same substance. 

Basilius Valentinus, a monk of the latter part of the 
 loth century, was the first who gave any insight into the 
 real difference between the caustic and mild alkalies. 
 In his remarks on the philospher's stone of the ancient.9 
 he says, with reference to the caustic and mild alkalies, 
 that the salt (sal) of the tartrates (weinsteins), as the 
 tartrates of potash by themselves, but more strikingly 
 when the heat of the quick lime was incorporated with 
 them solidified, and by combining with other bodies 
 made them fire proof. 

Here, saj's our author, already is the opinion ad- 
 vanced, that it is a particular substance that makes the 
 lime caustic, and that this substance goes from the lime 
 to the tartrates when they are made caustic by it. 

This opinion was thus modified, and received for a 
 long time (over one hundred years) as the best explana- 
 tion of the phenomena witnessed in lime burning to wit: 
 That lime by burning obtained from the fire a fire mate- 
 rial, (it is now known that it merely gives off csirbonic 
 acid, by which it becomes caustic lime,) which fire mate- 
 rial it gave off in pai-t when heated with water, (it mere- 
 ly absorbed a portion of water which rendered it less 
 caustic,) and when mixed with ley it gave off all this fire 
 material, (it became carbonate of lime as already ex- 
 plained, and this having no causticity they supposed it 
 had lost its fire.) 

This is the state of the iaiowledge of the world re- 
 specting lime after we trace its history for over 1000 
 years, and see it about the close of the loth century. 
 It is interesting to compare the opinions of men of the 
 present day, who have been familiarized with the prac- 
 tical part of lime burning, but who have not availed 
 themselves of the researches of modern science into the 
 theory of it, with those of these ancient investigators. 
 There is not unfrecjuently a similarity between them.
