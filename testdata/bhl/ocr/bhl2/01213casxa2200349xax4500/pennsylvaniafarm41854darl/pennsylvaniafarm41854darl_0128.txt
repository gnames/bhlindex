Bedford County Agricultural Society. 

Mt. Dallas Farm, Feb. 20th, 1854. 

Mr. Editor — Dear Sir: — The "Bedford County Agri- 
 cultural Society" met at Bedford on the 15th in;t., at 
 which time the annual election of officers took place. 

The society is in quite a tlourishing condition, and its 
 members are determined to spare no efforts to malce our 
 annual exhibitions as attractive and meritorious as those 
 of any other county in the state, population of course Ic- 
 ing equal. 

Our society is quite young, still we have a surplus in 
 the treasury of nearly ($!300) three bundled dollars, 
 ■which, though not a very large amount for these "golden 
 times," shows that we arc not hanhrupt at least. And 
 had it not been thnt many individuals took advantage of 
 our unguarded and unsuspecting regulations in regard 
 to ingi-ess and egress at the last fair, the amount of sur- 
 plus funds would be much larger. 

But our interests v/ill be better protected it is hoped 
 tiis year, since we hare "learned wisdom from experi- 
 ence," and then these graceless non-payers will be com- 
 pelled to pag for the gratification of their curiosity, or 
 else remain outside witli the dogs, (I ouglit to have in- 
 serted other before the last word.) 

A committee was appointed to enquire into the 
 practicability of purchasing or renting grounds, suit- 
 able for the use of the society at her future exhibi- 
 tions, as the court house, jail yard, and public square, 
 cannot afford sufficient compass for the increasing pros- 
 perity of our society. Among other things the follow- 
 ing resolution was unanimously passed : 

"Resolved, That the Ilcprcsentatives in the State Le- 
 gislature from this district be requested, on behalf of 
 the Bedford County Agricultural Society, to vote for any 

"• which may be brought before their honorable bodies 
 for ine k.t.. '"• Protection of fruit, grain, vegetables, ike, 
 &c." 

Before closing I wi:jh to state ol.. ''■'ct. Though pres- 
 ent at the three exhibitions of the State Society at Har- 
 risburg, Lancaster and Pittsburgh, and saw some small, 
 aye quite insigrvficant towns in our State represented hy 
 at least four or five judges, I did not sec Bedford county 
 represented by a man with a "ichitc ribbon on his beaver." 
 Bedford coimty has never yet had any of lier citizens to 
 officiate in that honorable, though not enviable, capaci- 
 ty, though there arc many persons in our county who 
 are members of the State Society, and as a State Socie- 
 ty her officers and judges ought to be selected from every 
 county in the State, at least we think so. Besides men 
 can be found in our county as sufficiently "compos men- 
 tis," as some individuals whom I saw offici<ating in that 
 capacity, who were besides neither farmers nor mechan- 
 ics, from which classes the majority of the officers, man- 
 agers and judges should be chosen. 

I mention these things, sir, for this reason. Partialitv 
 exists to a greater or less degree in the minds of all men. 

Now were these judges all chosen from one county, it is 
 very likely their minds would be biased towards the ar- 
 ticles and produce of that county, at least where two ar- 
 ticles are yary nearly equal, the "a7nor in pairiam" 
 will make the decision, so that I think our county should 
 not be slighted, and if it shall be, by the "powers that 
 be" we will certainly declare our independence, and then 
 what will become of the State Society ! 

The following persons were elected officers for the en- 
 suing year : 

President — ^hi]. Samr.el Davis, Bedford Borough. 

Vice Presidents — Thos. M. Lynch, Jolui Dickey, Benj. 
 R. Ashcom, Michael Ilalderbaum. 

Recording Secretary — John Mowrcr, Esq., Bedford 
 Borough. 

Coi-respondlng Secretary — AVilliam Hartley, Bloody

 Cor. Secretary.

Your correspondent in Leipsic would benefit the far- 
 mer here to make himself acquainted with sheep raising 
 in all its details (Schafferien); the great advantages to 
 manure the land by means of the (Schafpferg) sheepfold 
 over night, &c., as those seen in the neighborhood of 
 Weimar in Saxony. It would bo a source of profit here 
 in our mountain region. It is follv ti^ i-<^— arge flocks 
 of sheep without being under tiie care of a shepherd. 
 Respectfully vours,

Proper Time for Cutting Wood. 

I will inform the readers of the Farm Journal, from 
 10 to 15 3'ears experience, that fire wood cut and split, 
 and put under a shed to season, in a green state, is fully 
 worth one-third more than when dried standing in the 
 cord the usual way. PETER S. ALRICKS.
