Fraud in Fruit Trees. 

The Worcester Spy calls the attention to the fact that 
 many of the fruit trees sold by travelling agents are worth- 
 less. These trees arc said to be manufactured in tlie 
 State of New^ York, by a short process, called root grafting. 
 It is done by taking the roots of old trees in the winter, 
 and cutting them up into short pieces, into which is 
 grafted a scion. They are then packed away in the cel- 
 lar till spring, when they are set out, and in two years 
 they answer to cheat the greenlcs with, who buy trees of 
 irresponsible, strolling dealers. They will grow very 
 well in the nursery, like trees raised from suckers, for 
 three or four years, but like them they soon come to a 
 stand, assuming tlie appearance and decrepitude of old 
 trees. Many kinds, gi-owu in this way, that are natural- 
 ly very good bearers, will harldy bear at all.

WORK FOR THE MONTH. 

Farm. — Read over directions of last month, and at- 
 tend to what was omitted. Sow oats as soon as the 
 ground is in order ; harrow it thoroughly and then roll. 
 Pass the roller over niowing fields; also top dress winter 
 grain not previously manured, with short manure or gu- 
 ano and plaster. Plow for corn, and subsoil before 
 ground becomes too dry. ]\Iuch of the success of the 
 crop depends on good plowing and preparation of ground. 
 Avoid such plows, as turn up and leave a smooth, glazed 
 and unbroken furrow. The sun often hardens such into 
 lumps impervious to harrow. Fine pulverization of soil 
 is of great importance. Open sem.^ md cracks in the 
 furrow, wh'fb admit the air, greatly a.- ^-f «iib<ie- 
 queni opei'ation of the harrow. Spread the manuru v... 
 guano previous to plowing. In ordinary seasons there is 
 no advantage in planting corn in this section before sec- 
 ond week in next month, but the ground should be often 
 stirred previously. Plant e.arly potatoes. Plow and 
 prepare for root crops. Also for sowing corn for fodder, 
 when there is likely to be a necessity for it. Give par- 
 ticular attention to stock. After being well cared for all 
 winter, they often fall off in last month before pastur- 
 age. Ewes and lambs should have allowance of grain 
 and roots and good hay, daily turned out in fine weatlier 
 on a pasture lot reserved for the pui-pose. Continue or 
 increase the allowance of meal and roots to fresh cows. 
 It is an old saying that stock well wintered arc half sum- 
 mered. They should go out to grass in good order. 
 There is never any profit in keeping stock below the 
 thriving point. To merely keep them alive will not pay. 
 Do not turn out the stock to grass too early. Feed well 
 all working cattle, both oxen and horses. Cut hay is of 
 great advantage, as it economises time, and gives ani- 
 mals more time to rest between woi'king hours. It takes 
 them less time to eat it, and is easier digested. Give all 
 animals daily access to salt. 

Fruit Orchard. — Planting trees may still be done 
 this month, and in doing so, cut oflT all bruised and bro-
