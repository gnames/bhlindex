TJnited States Agricultural Society. 

Tlie second nnnual meeting of tlio United States Agri- 
 cultural Society was held in the Smithsonian Institute, 
 Washington, on the 22d, 23d, and 24th d.ajs of February. 
 No business was done on the first of these days on ac- 
 count of its being the birth day of AVashington — the so- 
 ciety simply meeting and adjourning. On Thursday — 
 the second day — the President, Hon. Marshall P. Wilder, 
 delivered his annual address, which was ordered to be 
 published. 

Mr. Denton Oflutt, of Lexington, Ky., moved the ap- 
 pointment of a committee on animal physiology, and the 
 general improvement of domestic animals. After several 
 gentlemen had urged tlie remarkable powers of Mr. 
 Oflutt in rendering vicious animals tractable, the Chair 
 appointed Messrs. Browne, of Pa., Earle, of Md., and 
 French, of Mass., on the committee. 

Prof. Mapes had exhibited a head of wheat, alleged to 
 be part wheat and part chess, which he stated had been 
 placed in his hands by a farmer in Livingston county, N. 
 Y. [A transaction somewhat similar to this took place 
 at a meeting of the Botanical Society in this county, 
 some years ago, when a gentleman presented for exami- 
 nation a specimen containing "two kinds of grasses 
 ■growing on the same stalk." The amateur botanists 
 examined it closely, and expressed their admiration at 
 the wonderful freak of nature, to the no small amuse- 
 ment of the wag whose skillful hands had made the 
 union. ] 

A communication was received from Mr. Joel Hitch- 
 cock, of N. Y., on the subject of a remedy for the pota- 
 toe rot, which after considerable discussion was referred 
 to the executive committee. A similar communication 
 in reference to the curculio was received from a Mr. 
 Matthews, of Ohio, which was referred to Messrs. Wil- 
 der, Brinckle and Brickman. 

On motion of ^Ir. Bradford, of Delaware, a committee 
 of five was appointed to intercede with the government 
 to either piirchase one of the Chincha islands, or by ne- 
 gotiation with Peru to terminate the guano monopoly. 

Dr. Warder presented some Japan peas. They were 
 introduced into the neighborhood of Cincinnati three 
 years ago. They grow upon a stiff woody stem, the 
 leaves of which are greedily devoured by cattle. The 
 fruit is abundant, and oblong when green, but round 
 when dry. They are not palatable when green, but are 
 liked by most persons when cooked in the dry state. 
 Their great value, however, will be as food for cattle. 

On the third day. Prof. Fox, of Michigan, delivered 
 an address relative to the extension of agricultural edu- 
 cation. Mr. Taylor off"ei'ed a resolution asking the gen- 
 eral government to purchase Mt. Vernon, with a view of 
 making a portion of it an experimental farm. This after 
 considerable discussion was laid on the table. 

The venerable G. W. P. Custis was called on for an 
 address, and responded by contrasting the former and 
 present state of agriculture. 

A memorial was received from Ohio, asking for the 
 countenance of the Society to a National Cattle Exhibi- 
 tion to be held in Springfield, Ohio. Referred to the 
 executive committee. 

A similar resolution relative to holding the National 
 Exhibition for Sheep in Vermont, at such time as the 

Agricultural Society of that State shall appoint, was 
 adopted. 

Dr. Eddie, of Mass., iu answer to a call, delivered a 
 lecture on bees and bee culture. 

The following officers were elected the ensuing year: 

Marshall P. Wilder, of Mass., President. 

19 Vice Presidents, (one for each State represented.) 

C. B. Calvert, John A. King, A. L. Elwyn, J. D. Wes- 
 ton, B. P. Poore, A. Watts, John Jones, W. S. King; Ex- 
 ecutive Committee. 

W. S. King, of Boston, Corresponding and Recording 
 Secretaiy. 

William Selden, of Washington, Treasurer. 

A Productive Hive. 

We are in receipt of a box of vei'y fine Honey from 
 the apiary of Dr. George Thomas, at Oakland Farm, in 
 this county. Accompanying the same, the Dr. makes the 
 following remarks respecting the Hive and its product, 
 which will interest those who pay attention to this de- 
 partment of the farm : — 

I purchased the Hive of John Hartman, of Lionville, 
 sprhig of 1850 — cost $12, and put in a swarm during 
 the summer of the same year. In the fall of '51 took 
 30 lbs of Honey. 1852 being an unfavorable season for 
 Bees — none of mine accumulating more than enough for 
 their winter supply, and several of the smaller hives dic- 
 ing either for want of food or from the attacks of the 
 moth — I consequently got no honey. This last fall, 1853, 
 however, the large hive produced 80 lbs. of superior 
 honey, which brought 28 cts. per lb., at least as much 
 as we wished to dispose of, leaving more than an ample 
 supply to keep the bees through the winter. Indeed, I 
 think we might safely have taken 20 or 30 lbs. more, 
 thus making during three summers, 110 lbs. of honey, 
 or over 33 lbs. per annum, and if all had been sold, the 
 yearly income from that one hive would have been 
 $9 24. 

They have never swarmed, nor have I discovered any 
 appear.ance of moth or worms. The hive was patented 
 and introdxiced into this neighborhod by a man from 
 Ohio some 15 years since, and from the success I have 
 had with it, I think it the best I have seen, and the very 
 one for those who like to have good honey, without the 
 trouble attendant on the smaller hives, which require so 
 much constant care and watching, particularly during the 
 swarming season. Several of these hives have been in use 
 in Uwchlan township, but I have not heard the result 
 save in two instances, one of which was very favorable, 
 both from the quantity and quality of honey produced, 
 and its complete exemption from disease, and from the 
 attacks of the Bee moth and other insects. The other 
 was tried for two seasons only, the proprietor thinking 
 they were not doing well, destroyed them. Bees seem 
 to do better some seasons than others, and something 
 may depend on the locality and the care bestowed upon 
 them, the conjunction of which causes may have opera- 
 ted in this case. 

Potting Strawberries. 
 Mr. Rivers, in London, raises strawberries in pots by 
 a peculiar process, thus described : 

About the second week in July, he says, he filled a
