glass of warm water; half a tea-spoonful of salt, and milk 
 enough to rub it out. Beat it half an hour with a pestle, 
 cut it into thin round cakes, prick them, and set them in 
 the oven when other things are taken out Let them bake till 
 crisp. 

Preservixg Herbs. — There are few persons who would 
 not be occasionally benefitted by a cup of good herb tea. I 
 do not mean such as is made from herbs dried in the sun, 
 and boiled for half an hour in an old tin cup. Such a mess 
 as that would make even a well person sick, who had ever 
 known a better plan. 

By attending to the following directions, all country peo- 
 ple can have good herbs ; and if they wish to give a city 
 friend some acceptable trifle in return for their dinner when 
 they go into the city shopping, let them roll up and carry a 
 good bundle of various kinds of herbs, for in the city even a 
 very small package costs sixpence, and a large proportion of 
 stems at that. 

All kinds of herbs should be picked as soon as they begin 
 to blossom, the dust rinsed off, the leaves and flowers strip- 
 ped from the stems and spread on tins or clear paper and 
 exposed to moderate artificial heat till perfectly dry and crisp, 
 then put away in a clean dry place. When required, make 
 the tea just as you would green tea for the table. Herbs are 
 better dried in the shade than in the sun, but a moderate heat 
 from the stove or oven is still better. 

This is not the case with the deodar, which, with a pecu- 
 liar stylo of beauty, has all the attributes of a desirable tree 
 to recommend it, a lively color, perfect hardiness, rapid 
 growth, and, so far as wo know, adaptation to any soil. In 
 England it is being planted out very extensively for timber. 
 The wood is very durable, and on being washed emits a very 
 sweet and delightful odor. Its growth is often nearly equal 
 to the Larch. We think it not excelled by any other tree. 

Early Rising Required by Will. 

The will of James Sargeant, late of Leicester, England, 
 contains the following clause : 

"As my nephews are fond of indulging themselves in bed 
 in the morning, and as I wish them to prove to the satisfac- 
 tion of my executors that they have got out of their bed in 
 the morning, and either employed themselves in business, 
 or taken exercise in the open air from five to eight o'clock 
 every morning from the 5th of April, to the 10th of October, 
 being tliree hours each day, and from seven to nine o'clock 
 in the morning from the 10th of October to the 5th of April, 
 being two hours every morning, this to be done for some 
 years, to the satisfaction of my executors, who may excuse 
 them in case of illness, but the task must be made up when 
 they are well ; and if they will not do this, they shall not re- 
 ceive any of my property. Temperance makes the faculties 
 clear and exercise makes them vigorous. It is temperance 
 and exercise united thnt can alone insure the fittest state for 
 mental and bodily exertion." 

The above may seem an eccentric provision, but it would 
 add to the health, happiness and comfort of large numbers 
 of the heirs of wealth, were they compelled to form the habits 
 of early rising in youth. 

Ornamental Trees and Shrubbery. 

The period for planting having arrived, wo have a word 
 to say in fiivor of two or three trees, deserving of being 
 more generally planted. Of evergreens, no land of course 
 is considered complete without some specimens of Norway 
 and silver fir, white fir, balsam fir, arbor vita;, junipers, 
 hemlocks, and other well known varieties. 

Deodar cedar and Cryptomeri.a Japonica, two beautiful ev- 
 ergreens, whose hardiness and rapid growth h.ave both been 
 fully tested, are comparativelj' seldom seen. One of our 
 friends had a plant of the latter which grow four feet the 
 past season, and has stood the winter unharmed. Its habit 
 is rather pendant, and the foliage extremely delicate and 
 graceful, and it is a very valuable addition to our list of or- 
 namental trees. One drawback, however, is its not holding 
 its green color entirely through the winter, taking rather a 
 brown tinge. 

Bommer Method of Making Manure. 

Messrs. Editors: — I saw in a late number of the Culti- 
 vator, some inquiries as to Bommer's method of making 
 manure, and your answer, giving details, <fec. I thought 
 perhaps the experience of Maryland might be of some use 
 on the subject. The process, when first introduced here, 
 created quite a sensation. One gentleman in the city of Bal- 
 timore purchased the right to manufacture, and thought he 
 had found an easy solution of all the difficulties of agricul- 
 ture. So sanguine was he of the result, that ho left his busi- 
 ness in the city, and bought a farm in the country, which 
 very much needed manure. He told his neighbors he in- 
 tended to make it rich, as he could make as much manure as 
 he wanted out of briars, brush, &c. He put up one pile, 
 but never tried another : and I may add I never knew a 
 man who put a second, for it was soon found that the value 
 of manure depended upon the strength of the ingredients, 
 and where brush and briar bushes were used, the manure 
 was of little use after it had been prepared. Mr. Bommer is 
 by no means as smart as Paddy from Cork's blacksmith, 
 who could make glass out of stone and stone out of nothing 
 at all. The best way of manufacturing Bomner manure is 
 to put the cornstalks, straw, &c., on a well constructed cat- 
 tle-yard, for then whatever strength there is in the material 
 is secured, and by absorbing the liquid, &c., they help t ) 
 save more valuable substances. I suppose the farmers of 
 Maryland paid from five to ten thousand dollars for the se- 
 cret without ever receiving $100 in return. From 100 to 200 
 tons of guano might have been purchased with the money, 
 one ton of which would have been worth all the Bommer 
 manure ever manufactured in Maryland. I do not believe 
 that one man in the state uses the method now. — C. V. 
 Pikesi-ille, Md. 

We copy the above from the Country Gentleman, with 
 the remark that the agent for the sale of Bommer's pa- 
 tent for manure passed through Chester county, Pa., and 
 succeeded in collecting considerable money from our far- 
 mers, ■who have never yet received, so far as we know, 
 any benefit from it whatever. The agent was a genuine 
 Yankee, we should judge from the farthest point cast, 
 and did his business well, often introducing it with an 
 affectionate preliminary enquiry after tlie wife and fam- 

An Explanation. 

AVe are daily receiving inquiries as to '"why are such and 
 such persons' Journals not forwarded'/" It would save us a 
 vast amount of letter writing if our friends would remember 
 that, on the first day of last January, we changed our terms 
 from the credit to the cash system, and had a notice of this 
 change folded in every copy of the January number of the 
 Journal sent out. Since then we have mailed the Journal to 
 none who have not paid in advance. 

While there are thousands of names upon our books for 
 the last volume, whose word we know to be as good as gold, 
 there are others, which experience has taught us, uro not so. 
 As wo could not hope to make a correct distinction in so 
 large a list, we were compelled either to continue as hereto-
