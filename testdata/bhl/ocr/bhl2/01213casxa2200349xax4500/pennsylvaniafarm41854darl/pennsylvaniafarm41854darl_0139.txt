The ground was an old meadow, which had never been 
 plowed. Soil, black muck, rather wet. It was plowed tlie 
 20th and 21st days of Maj-, 1853, with a double team, eight 
 inches deep, and was harrowed four times the 25th of May, 
 and was furrowed and planted three and a half feet each 
 way, on the 2Cth same month. It was worked with a 
 cultivator twice, and with a shovel plow three times, twice 
 in a row each time. It was hoed twice. The corn was up 
 in six days after planting, and plastered soon after coming 
 up. There was no manure used. The corn was cut up by 
 the roots the 24th of September, 1853, and threshed the 
 15th of February, 1854. 

To Robert Evans for the best acre of Barley, two dol- 
 lars. The yield being 52 bushels and 30i pounds. The 
 previous crop was corn, .and plowed in the fall. Sowed two 
 bushels to the acre the 30th of March and harrowed and 
 rolled. The seed was the six rowed barley. It was har- 
 vested the 12th of July, and threshed the 8th of February, 
 1 854. The soil was a black walnut bottom. 

To James Sampson, for the best field of barley, not less 
 than three acres, three dollars.

 Carrots were raised on the same ground two years before 
 thin crop About fifteen or eighteen loads of manure were 
 spread on the land, and plowing was eighteen inches or 
 wore deep. The land was a, chestnut ridge of a loamy kind, 
 and the sowing was about the middle of M.ay, in rows four-

I was much pleased to hear from members of the society, 
 from various sections of our county, that your valuable Jour- 
 nal is gradually winning its way to popular favor in this re- 
 mote district. The field here has been ao long occupied by 
 the New York papers, that it is difiicult for a new comer to 
 get foot-hold among us. Nevertheless, it is so manifestly 
 to the advantage, to say nothing of the duty of every Penn- 
 sylvania farmer, to support fir-it his own State paper, and 
 then take such other publications as he may see proper, thai 
 I hope the day is not very far distant, when every farmer in 
 our staunch old Commonwealth, will as soon thihk of being 
 Without a Bible in his holise, as to be without the Farm 
 Journal. 

At any rate, I trust that every member of the Erie 
 County Agricultural Society, will feel it a duty not only to 
 order your Journal for himself, but will call on his neighbor 
 and get his subscription also. With my best wishes for the 
 Gontiiuied prosperity of your excellent work. I remain 

Yours truly, R. S. T.

Transmutation of Plants. 

In the Farm Journal for November, 1852, we noticed 
 a statement in Hover/ s Magazine, that a Mens. Fabse 
 had demonstrated, in France, the curious fact, that by 
 seven successive crops a certain wild grass, called Aegilops, 
 had been changed into genuine wheat. 

As Mr. HovEY seemed to be a convert to the belief in 
 such transmutation, we expressed the hope that he 
 woidd take measures to procure specimens from Mons. 
 Fabre of that remarkable grass, showing its progress 
 each successive year, from its original wild state to per- 
 fect wheat. We have waited anxiously for the demon- 
 stration of tliat interesting change ; and hoped to hear, 
 long ere thi.s, of the arrival of the evidences : but al- 
 though the ships are urged by steam, and Mr. Iloveg's 
 Magazine ajipears monthly, wc do not learn that he has 
 yet obtained the specimens required to establish the im- 
 portant fact. If Mr. Jloveg would at once take the ef- 
 fective measures to procure a number of good .specimens 
 in the various stages of progress, the naturalists of this 
 country would undoubtedly be grateful for the favor; 
 and surely .specimens may be obtained of a plant which 
 has been so long under cultivation. As objects of natu- 
 ral history are admitted /;r(; of duty, there would prob- 
 ably be little other expense beside the freight, and thai 
 we will cheerfully pay, if Mr. Hoveg will only have the 
 goodness to obtain anthentic specimens for us, — one or 
 more, if possible, of each of the successive seven crops ; 
 but, at all events, good samples of the entire plants in 
 their state of perfect transi.nita'.ion. Relying upon his 
 public spirit, and love of scientific truth, we shall hope- 
 fully await the result of his efforts to c.-tablish the veri- 
 ty of the annunciation formerly made. 

Speaking of transmutation we would add in this con- 
 nection, that we have seen an account of Prof. Mapes 
 having recently produced to the Natlonar Agricultural
