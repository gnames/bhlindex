Society a specimen of grass, the spike of -which was in 
 a iraimlioH state — half icheat and half c/icat, or Bromus. 
 This would be vei-y interesting to examine, and if the 
 Professor has any "more of the same sort," we respect- 
 fully suggest that he would do a favor to science, by 
 placing a fair sample with a curator of the Ilcrharium, 
 at the rhiladelphia Academy, or in some convenient 
 position, where amateurs might have a chance to look at 
 it. D.

Fruit Trees and Brimstone— Experience vs. Theory. 

There is an opinion abroad, that sulphur introduced 
 into the body of a fruit tree, particularly into the plum 
 tree, the sap will take up a sufBcient quantity of the sul- 
 phur to nauseate the fly or worm so as to prevent its do- 
 ing injury to the fruit : the only objection to the use of 
 tlie sulphur being that it would and did effect the flavor 
 of the fruit during the whole time it was being absorbed. 
 Willing to try anything by which there was a chance of 
 keeping my plums on the trees to ripen, over twelve years 
 ago I procured roll brimstone, selecting such fts were 
 perfectly smooth and round, bored a hole in the body of 
 the trees through the heait of the exact size of the roll 
 of brimstone, which being introduced, a short tight fill- 
 ing white pine plug closed the hole, v\"hich years since 
 was covered by the bark. 

Now for the result: we thought that the tree was ben- 
 efitted, the leaves looked fresher, the fruit held on better, 
 was certainly better. But there could be detected a sid- 
 phur fi:ivor, which in time would diminish as the brim- 
 stone was diffused ; in short brimstone was the panacea 
 for plums. 

One of these trees having died this winter, it was cut 
 down this day, and most carefully opened where the 
 brimstone was introduced. AVhen, lo ! there was the 
 whole roll, perfect as put in, not even the slight marks 
 made in moulding in the least defaced ; in short nothing, 
 not even gold itself, could have come out from a twelve 
 years incarceration less changed. So my experience ex- 
 jjiodes one humbug. L.

ETJITEE MOULDS. 
 Tliis cut represents a 
 ^ t.ry neat implement for 
 moulding butter, in pound 
 (II two pound lumps, either 
 iui- table or market. 

This is the only instrument in use fur prop'?rly testing tbo 
 quality of milk drawn from various cows. The tubes are of 
 glass, and are fixed in a wooden frame. The tubes being 
 divided and subdivided by tnarks into equal spaces, are fill- 
 ed to equal heights, each with the milk of a particular cow. 
 When the cream rises, the exact difference in the quantity is 
 readily determined. 

SPAIN'S PATENT ATMOSPHEKIC BARREL CHURN. 

This churn will make more butter, of a better quality, 
 from a given quantity of cream, than any other now in 
 use. 

It is constructed in such a manner that the whole reel or 
 dashers can be removed (whole) from the inside of the 
 churn, by simply unscrewing the handle from the dasher, 
 and raising the handle end of the dasher to the square of 
 the hole. The peculiar construction of the dasher agitates 
 the cream in the centre as well as the sides, giving it a ro- 
 tary motion, and preventing the cream from revolving with 
 the dasher after it becomes thick. They also gather the 
 butter quicker and better. They have tubes in the lid for 
 the purpose of letting the gas escape as fast as it rises, and 
 also admit the fresh air to pass freely through the churn 
 while in operation. After churning, the dashers can be re- 
 moved for a perfect cleaning. The churn is then clear of 
 all impediments in the vray of removing the butter. 

These churns have taken two premiums at the Franklin 
 Institute, and are regarded as the best in the country by 
 many experienced dairymen. We are requested to add that 
 P. Morris &, Co., northeast corner of Seventh and Market 
 streets, to whom we are indebted for the cut, are the sol 
 manufacturers and agents in Philadelphia. 

IMPROVED GRINDSTONE HANGINGS. 

The following represents a grindstone to which improved 
 hangings are attached. It is turned by a crank on one side 
 and by a treadle on the other. By means of the treadle one 
 person is enabled to turn and grind at the same time. The 
 fixtures are finished in the most admirable manner, and are
