selected with a view of quality and rotation of crops, (from 
 the earliest to the latest) also a great variety of choice 
 pears, cherries, apricots, quinces and plumbs. The garden 
 is largo well laid off and abounds iu the best variety of 
 raspliorrief, strawberries, grajjes, goosberries, currants, &c., 
 and is adoriKMl with choice roses and tlowers. The yards 
 are neatly laid out and decorated with shrubbery, evergreens, 
 ornamental trees, <tc. 

This farm is now offered to the public at Private Sale. A 
 situation placed contiguous to such a thriving enterprising and 
 moral town as Smyrna, affording a market to all kinds of 
 produce, as romuueralive as Philadelphia prices, with few 
 exceptions, and a daily communication by Steamboats to 
 Philadelphia, is not often in the market. The many 
 advantages itposesses, are too numerous to place upon paper. 
 Persons desirous of such a situation as a place of residence 
 would do well to call and examine for themselves.

N. B. — The course of improvement which I adopted is 
 one, in all probabilitj^, that will not meet with the views of 
 the great mass of Agricidturists, more particularly those 
 who are dependent solely upon the product of our poor, im- 
 poverished and worn out farms. 

Where persons have the means, or the abilibity to persue 
 a fast or rapid course of improvement, I certainly should 
 recommend a liberal outlay at once, being thoroughly and 
 satisfactorily convinced in two instances, where I have im- 
 proved tracts of land worn out and impoverished, and that 
 proof based upon correct accounts kept of expenditures, iu- 
 chiding interests, &c., that the first cost added to improve- 
 ments, (where the improvements are confined principally to 
 application upon the soil) will pay an interestof 10 per cent, 
 easier than the land in its original worn out condition will 
 I)ay an interest of 6 per cent. 

My views upon the most economical and safe plan to be 
 pursued by persons who .are solely dependent as stated above, 
 ■would be, first apply Guano to wheat, sow clover seed upon 
 wheat, plaster, clover, and apply lime upon the sod, and let 
 remain not less than 12 months. 

Mapes in this case, for our most learned agrieulturist.s some- 
 times fall into great errors, which careful, practical, life-long 

farmers readily detect.

Bushel and Acre. 

What difference is there in the United States bushel .and 
 the English — also in the acre of the two countries ? Ana. 
 The standard bushel of the United States is the same as the 
 "Winchester bushel," which was the standard in England 
 from the time of Henry VII to 1826, and contains 2150.4 
 cubic inches. The present standard in England is the "Im- . 
 perial bushel," which contains 2218.192 cubic inches, being 
 within a fraction of 68 cubic inches larger than that of the 
 United States. The acre is the same in both countries. 

Wheat vs. Cheat Again. 

[We take the following extract from a communication by 
 our friend Jacob Gundy, Esq., of Union county, in the 
 Lewisburg Chronicle:] 

Mr. Epitor : — I see in your paper of to-day a statement 
 that Prof. Mapes had exhibited a specimen of Wheat and 
 Chess growing upon the same head, and asking for the expe- 
 rience uf farmers on the subject. 

For twenty years I have made this a matter of special at- 
 tention, and my experience is that wheat will not degenerate 
 to chess, under any circumstances. 

A microscopic investigation of the head exhibitedby Prof. 
 Mapes might perhaps reveal a deception, and it would not 
 be the first time that fraud has been used to prove that wheat 
 will turn to cheat. 

When I was in Washington, nearly two years ago, D. Lee, 
 Jr., informed me that some of the agricultural societies in 
 'York State had offered $100 to any pei-son who would pro- 
 duce a stalk on which the two kinds of grain were growing 
 at the same time. Two stalks were offered for the prize. 
 One was found, however, to have a head of wheat glued 
 upon a stalk of cheat at a nicely-fitted joint, and a thread 
 run through the head and stalk to the root, to hold it well 
 ton-ether. The next specimen, however, was thought to be 
 genuine : there was certainly wheat and cheat mixed on the 
 same head. But after a closer examination it was found that 
 the chess was pasted in the wheat by a paste of the same 
 color as the straw, and it was so well done that it required 
 the closest scrutiny with the microscope to detect the fraud. 

Such an imposition may have been practiced upon Prof. 

Nitric Acid, a Source of Nitrogen in Plants. 

The source from which plants obtain nitrogen, which is 
 now recognised as one of their most important elements, 
 has, from the first recognition of its importance, been a mat- 
 ter of dispute. Latterlj', however, chemists and physiolo- 
 gists have pretty unanimously come to the conclusion that 
 a large (perh.aps the largest) part of the nitrogen of vegeta- 
 bles is derived from ammonia ; whilst much discussion has 
 been carried on as to the question, Is any part of their nitro- 
 gen yielded by nitric acid ? 

Firstly. The prduction of nitric acid in the atmosphere 
 during thunder-storms is a certain, not a questionable fact ; 
 and the scale on which it is produced is such as to necessi- 
 tate its recognition as a portion of the azotised food of plants. 
 That this should have been questioned is perha)is not 
 strange, for the newly discovered truth thatammonia is gen- 
 erally present in the air could scarcely fail to throw into 
 temporary oblivion the equally important truth that nitric 
 acid is generally tliero also. The name of the great living 
 chemist Leibig is identified with one discovery, and the 
 great dead chemist Cavendish, with the other ; and vv'o must 
 not grudge that the greater interest should be felt by most 
 in the doings of the great living philosopher. But assured- 
 ly it is not necessarj' to set the two truths against each other 
 as if they were mutually incompatible, or in anj^ respect 
 contradictor}'. On the other hand I believe they are com- 
 plementarj', and form an essential and manifest part of the 
 harmonious adjustment which we everywhere perceive 
 guarding plants and animals against imperfect nourishment 
 or decay. 

Secondly. As for the proposition that the ammonia of the 
 atmosphere, is converted by simple oxidation, as iu the pro- 
 cess of nitrification at the surface of the earth into nitric 
 acid, I might leave it unconsidered, for my concern is simply 
 with nitric acid, not with its source. I am quite prepared 
 to admit the probability of atmospheric ammonia undergoing 
 a convertion into nitric acid; for although one condition es- 
 sential to nitrification in the soil, namely, the presence of al- 
 kali or alkaline earth, is wanting, j'et, from what is known 
 of the intense oxidizing power of oxone, we may well believe 
 that when it is developed in the air, as it so certainly and 
 frequentlj' is, it will compel the conversion of ammonia into 
 nitric acid. It will presently, indeed appear that from the 
 recent researches of Barrel, it is probable that nitric acid is 
 generated in the atmosphere at the expense of ammonia. If 
 this, however be the case, then we must acknowledge, that 
 in addition to thunder-storms, a force is constiintly at work 
 in the air producing nitric acid, and further, that this force 
 is constantly removing from the atmosphere the ammonia on 
 which plants are supposed to be solely dependent for nitrogen. 

Thirdly, Rain water is often found to contain nitric acid 
 in combination of different bases. 

Fourthly. It has been known for more than a century 
 that many springs contain nitrates. 

Fifthly. It is now univers.ally admitted that whatever 
 nitrogenous vegetable or animal matter is exposed to the air 
 along with alkaline bases, nramouia is developed, and then 
 oxidised into nitric acid, Avhich combines with the b.ases. 
 Now, those conditions nre extensively realised .all over the 
 globe, both in cultivated and uncultivated tracts of land ; 
 and in the w.armer regions of the earth, where decomposition 
 proceeds with the greatest rapidity, the production of nitre 
 in the soil is conptiint and immense. India alone furnishes 
 Great Britain with all the nitre needed for her gunpowder.
