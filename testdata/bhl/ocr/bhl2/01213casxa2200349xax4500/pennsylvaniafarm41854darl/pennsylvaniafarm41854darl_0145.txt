celebrated for their fertility, provided a due supply of water 
 is furnished to them. 

Seventhly. The alkaline nitrates dissolved in water, and 
 not employed in too strong solutions, have been found great- 
 ly to quicken the growth of plants ; and the nitrate of soda, 
 which, from its cheapness, is most accessible, is daily coming 
 into greater use among our farmers. In the current number 
 of the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society will bo 
 found the last of a series of papers on this subject, in which 
 the virtues of nitrate of soda, in increasing the amount of 
 the growth of Wheat yielded by a field manured with it, are 
 placed by Mr. Pusoy, above those of ammonia. 

AVhatever else, however, is doubtful this is certain, and is 
 acknowledged by Chemists of every school, viz : that a 
 plant is like a blast furnace, which the sun kindles every 
 day into full action ; and that no oxide can pass through 
 such an apparatus without risking the loss of all its oxj'gen. 
 With what consistency, then, can it be contended that water 
 carbonic, acid, and sulphuric acid, cannot pass through a 
 plant in the presence of sunshine, without being deprived in 
 whole or in part of their oxygon, but that the much more 
 easily deoxidised nitric acid, in the same circumstances, will 
 not suffer deoxidation ? It might as well be affirmed that a 
 blast furnace may be competent to reduce the refractory ox- 
 ide in iron, and yet be iucompatont to reduce the easily 
 reducible oxide of lead. 

Teachers of Chemistry appear to bo reluctant to admit 
 two sources of nitrogen for plants, because it complicates 
 their statements, and multiplies their formula; ; but the par- 
 tial representations of truth, to which all teachers are com- 
 pelled, however catholic in spirit, can never justify the ex- 
 pression of one sided views, as the counterpart of the multi- 
 form unity of nature. Those, moreover, who have been ac- 
 customed to trace back all azotised vegetable compounds to 
 ammonia, need only postulate that nitric acid having been 
 deoxidised into nitrogen, that element mixes with hydro- 
 gen to form ammonia, before any organic compound is devel- 
 oped ; and thereafter they may carry out the ammonia theory 
 as before. Such a conversion of nitric acid into ammonia is 
 not hypothetical, for it can be readily effected by diluting 
 the acid largely with water, and dissolving zinc in it. 

It would consist with the modesty of true science to be less 
 dogmatic than we generally are on the phenemeua which 
 occur within the inscrutable recesses of a living plant ; and 
 the probability of its being able to employ as food various 
 aaotised as well as other compounds. If, however, we are re- 
 quired to reduce to its simplest chemical expression the 
 conclusion to which our present science warrants regarding 
 the inorganic origin of the nitrogen, so essential to plants, 
 we must not say that only ammonia, or only nitric acid is its 
 source, but that both are ; or in a word, that the chief mine- 
 ral or inorganic representative and parent of a nitrogenous 
 constituents of plants and animals is the nitrate of ammonia.

AD INTERIM FRUIT REPORT. 

FEURtJARV 21, 1854. 
 To the President of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society: 

The Fruit Committee respectfully present their usual 
 monthly Ad Interim Report, in relation to the Pomogioal ob- 
 jects submitted to their examination since the last stated 
 meeting of the Society, 

Wortley Hall Seedling — from J. Fiske Allen, of Salem, 
 Massachusetts. — Mr, Allen considers this Grape far before 
 all others for the retarding house. The Wortley Hall Seed- 
 ling has some resemblance to the West's St. Peter's. The 
 berry of the former, however is more oval in form, and has a 
 thicker skin. Bunch, seven and a half inches long by three 
 and a half broad; shouldere<l ; berries loose on the bunch ; 
 berr}-, seven-eighths of an inch long, two-thirds wide; form, 
 oval; color, bluish black; skin, thick; flesh, solid; flavor, 
 sweet, and somewhat vinous; quality, taking into considera- 
 its long-keeping property, "very good." 

Newtown Pippin Apple — from Dr. E. S. Hull, President 
 of the Alton Horticultural Society, Illinois. These were the 
 largest and most beautiful specimens of this variety that we 
 have seen for many years. They were more conical in form 
 than those we ordinarily meet with. Quality, "best." 

Gnllet Apple — from Dr. E. S. Hull, Alton, Hlinois — Spec- 
 imens variable in form and external appearance ; one speci- 
 men resembling Pryor's Red. Size large, from three and 
 one-eighth inches long by three and seven-eighths broad, to I 

two and seven-eighths by three and three-eighths; form, ob- 
 late inclining to conical, sometimes oblong ; color, brown in 
 stripes, on a greenish yellow ground, with numerous grey 
 dots, and occasionally a few green russet blotches ; stem, 
 five-eighths of an inch long, and slender, often short and 
 thick, inserted in a deep, narrow, sometimes open cavity ; 
 calyx, medium, set in a small, often rather wide, shallow ba- 
 sin; core, small; seed, small, dark brown, acute-ovate; flesh 
 fine texture, juicy; flavor, pleasant; quality, "very good," 

The Gilpin or Carthouae Apple — from Dr. Hull, Alton, Illi- 
 nois. — Specimens not true to name. The variety being un- 
 known to us, we annex the following description of it : Size, 
 under medium, two and three-sixteenths of an inch long by- 
 two and five-eighths of an inch broad ; form, conical, broad- 
 est at the base ; color, mottled and stripped with red, and 
 interspersed with many grey dots; stem, half inch long by 
 one ninth thick, inserted in an open, accuminate cavity, slight- 
 ly russeted; calyx, medium, set in a wide, rather deep basin; 
 flesh, crisp, juicy ; flavor, pleasant ; quality, "good." 

lianle's Janet — from Dr. Hull, Alton, Illinois. — Size, medi- 
 um, two and seven-eighths inches long by three broad; form 
 roundish ; color, mottled and striped, with pale red on a 
 greenish yellow ground ; stem, slender, three-fourths of an 
 inch long by one-tenth thick, inserted in a narrow, accumi- 
 nate cavity ; calj^x, medium, set in a wide, shallow basin ; 
 flesh, greenish white, fine texture, tender, juicy ; flavor, ex- 
 cellent; quality, "very good." 

Heading Pear — from Nicholas Lott, Reading. — This fine 
 native winter pear we have repeatedly noticed in our Ad In- 
 terim Reports. Specimens not as largo as usual. 

Pears fur their nomc^-from Nicholas Lott, Reading. — 
 These were large speciraens of Uvedale's St. Germain, fami- 
 liarly known in this country as the Pound Pear. 

Orange PippinsandDumpling Apijles — from Nicholas Lott, 
 Reading. — In former Reports we have noticed both of these 
 varieties. 

Keim — from Mrs. Kessler, Reading. — The late-keeping 
 native apple has been noticed in several of cur previous Ad 
 Interim Reports. Several from Mrs. Kessler very fine. 

A Strawberry Plant in Pot — from Mr. Thomas Meehan. — 
 This plant contained one ripe, perfect berry ; size, large, 
 nearly throe and three-forths inches in its horizontal circum- 
 ference ; form, roundish ; color, brick-dust red, with brown- 
 ish seed set in superficial indentations. Besides this ripe 
 berry, it had on it four deformed and defective unripe ones, 
 and eight abortive flowers. The anthers, that were still visi- 
 ble, shewed it to be a staminate variety ; and bj' some of tho 
 Committee it was considered the Gushing. With this plant 
 the following letter to the Committee was received on the 9th 
 instant: — 

"To the Fruit Committee of the Pennsylvania Hortienltural 
 Society : 

"Gentlemen : — In seeking the name of the Strawberry 
 sent herewith, I beg to make a few remarks in connection. 
 Last spring I exhibited before the Society three plants, as I 
 believed of the same variety as this. One plant having all 
 the flowers pistillate, another all hermaphrodite ; the third 
 having both pistillate and hermphrodite. By direction of tho 
 Society my remarks sent with the plants were printed. 
 Friends at a distance subsequently came forward, who expres- 
 ed an opinion that my plants could not be 'Hovey's Seedling,' 
 must be some variety in which the power to varj' in its sex- 
 sexual character was a "characteristic" feature. I may be 
 allowed to observe that if this variety he not Ilovey's — a 
 strawberrj' that bears abundantly, will produce fruit averag- 
 ing from three to three and a half inches in circumference — 
 not only in its natural season, but the first week in Febru- 
 ary, and hermaphrodite in its sexual character, is at least 
 equal to Hovey's. The history of this kind, so far as my 
 knowledge is concerned, is as follows: When I took charge 
 of this establishment, in 1852, a largeplantation of strawber- 
 ries had been made the proceeding fall, and which were giv- 
 en up to me as a new bed of Ilovey's Seedlings. The plants 
 being set eighteen inches apart, afforded good opportunity 
 for observation. On their first flowering every one that flow- 
 ered up to a certain date, comprising nearly the whole of 
 them, bore pistillate blossoms. There being no others on tho 
 place, and being at that time myself a firm believer in the 
 "unchanging" theory, I mentioned to my esteemed emidoyer 
 the fix we were in, and suggested the propriety of procuring 
 at once some staminate varieties. A week or so afterwards 
 he being at Springbrook, we examined (he bed together, 
 when little else but hermaphrodites were to be found. This
