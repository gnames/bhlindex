suggested to me the experiments you are already advised of. j 
 Tlie plant from which this fruit was obtained was from a 
 jilant marked while in flower last spring. It is a very weak j 
 plant, as you will perceive by its inability to bring to perfoc- 
 tion, at this early season of the year, the other very few flow- 
 ers that opened, and that it was hermaphrodite you will read- j 
 ily perceive by the dead stamens at the base of the fruit. In 
 its natural season of fruiting the color is deep crimson.

"THOMAS MEEIIAN. 
 Mr. Meehan is well known as one of our most estimable, j 
 intelligent, and scieutitic cultivators. His honesty and in- j 
 tegrity, wo are fully convinced, would not suffer him to ad- 
 vance an opinion the soundness of which he did not most con- 
 scientiously believe. And by all who know him it is freely 
 admitt<>d that his views on horticultural subjects are remarka- 
 bly correct. Entertaining, as we do, these opinions of Mr. 
 Meehan, we regretted the appearance of his communication 
 to the Society, on the 17th of March, 185:{, respecting the 
 changablo sexual character of Ilovey's Seedling Strawberry. 
 Being persuaded that he had been led, unintentionaly, into 
 error, we were unwilling to take any action, officially or in- 
 dividually, in regard to his communication, under a convic- 
 tion thathis acknowledged discernment, honesty and intelli- 
 gence would eventually enable him to discover the unsound- 
 ness of his experiments, and cause him unhesitatingly to re- 
 pudiate them. His letter has, however, now brought the mat- 
 ter fully before us, in such a way that we are no longer at 
 liberty to decline its investigation. In the paper readbefore 
 the Society, and referred to in his letter to the Committee, he 
 broadly asserts thatHovey's Seedling may be made staminate 
 or pistillate, at pleasure, by cultivation. In proof of this as- 
 sertion, he exhibited three plants, each in a separate pot — 
 one having none but pistillate blossoms : the second none 
 but hermaphrodite blossoms ; the third containing blossoms 
 some of which were pistillate and the others hermaphrodite; 
 and these several sexual differences he attributed entirely to 
 cultivation. Now, if each one of these three plants was a 
 genuine Ilovey's Secdly, Mr. Meehan has most unquestion- 
 ablj' and conclusively established the truth of the doctrine 
 for which he contends. The vital question, then, to be solv- 
 ed is, was each of these plants a genuine Ilovey's Seedling? 
 This point wo will now examine. In the communication to 
 the Society no evidence of their genuineness is presented, 
 apart from the simple statement that they were Ilovey's Seed- 
 ling. On this point, however, the letter to the Committee 
 does not leave us so much in the dark. So far, however, 
 from establishing their genuineness, it furnishes strong 
 grounds for a contrary belief. For in it Mr. Meehan gives 
 us their history in the following words : "When I took 
 charge of this establishment, (Springbrook), in 1852, a 
 large jilantntion of strawberies had been made the preced- 
 ing fall, and which were given up to me as a new bed 
 of Hovey's Seedling." Subsequently, in speaking of the 
 plants in this bed, he emphatically assures us "there were 
 no others on the place." This bed then was the source 
 ■whence Mr. Meehan obtained the plants with which he ex- 
 perimented. And the only evidence he had that they were 
 Hovey's Seedling was that they were given up to him as 
 Buch. In this stage of the investigation it is of some conse- 
 quence to know whether this bed was made by a person in 
 whose honesty and accuracy implicit confidence could be re- 
 posed. It is known that Thomas Ryan's successor, and Mr. 
 Meehan's immediate predecessor, was gardener to Mr. Copo 
 in the fall of 1851, when the above-mentioned bed was set 
 out : but wo question whether Mr. Cope or Mr. Meehan will 
 say that he was entitled to such confidence. It is a matter 
 of record that there were a number of varieties at Spring- 
 brook the year before. On referring to the proceedings of 
 our Society for March, 1850, it will be seen that Ben. Dan- 
 iels exhibited a 'bed' containing the following sixvarieties of 
 strawberries, vix : Hovey's Seedling, British Queen, Buist's 
 Early May, Keen's Seedling, Sciota, and Cushing. At that 
 meeting the proceedings also show that the fruit Committee 
 awarded "a special premium of ten dollars to Ben. Daniels, 
 gardener to C. Cope, for the magnificent display of straw- 
 berries, embracing several foreign and native varieties." It 
 is barely possible that all these plants, embracing six varie- 
 ties, were in some way or other lost : but is it probable that 
 such was the case ? Is it not far more probable as they formed 
 so attractivea featureat the March meeting, andexcitedatthe 
 time such universal admiration, that they wore not only re- 
 tained but that they had increased in numbers ; and that 
 some of them were used in making the "new bed of Hovey's 

Seedling " in the fall of 1851. For we have the positive as- 
 surrance of Mr. Meehan that there were no strawberries at 
 Springbrook when he took charge of it in 1852, except those 
 contained in the bed whence he took the plants with which his 
 experiments were conducted. But even admitting that this 
 bod was made entirelj' from a plantion which originally were 
 undoubted Hovey's Seedling, it by no means follows that the 
 bed contained none but genuine plants of this kind. For no 
 bed, of any variety, can exist for two or three consecutive 
 years in a bearing state without having its purity more or 
 less impaired by accidental Seedlings. Many of the seed, 
 that necessarily fall to the ground, vegetate and produce 
 plants — some of which will differ from their maternal parent 
 in sexual organization, time of infloreseene, period of matur- 
 ity, and in various other particulars. We have seen straw- 
 berry seed, that were planted in midsummer, produce plants 
 that bore fruit the very next year. There is no certainty 
 therefore, that all the jilants in a be<l are of one kind, unless 
 thej' are all produced by runners from a single plant. In re- 
 gard to the plants in the bed at Springbrook, Mr. Meehan says, 
 in his letter to the Committee, — '"on theirfirst flowering every 
 one that flowered up to a certain date, comprising nearly the 
 whole of them, bore pistillate blossoms." * * * * * 
 "A week or so aftcrward.s, he (Mr. Cope) being atSringbrook, 
 we examined the bed together, when little else but heraphro- 
 ditos wore to be found." The question here arises,— how 
 can this difference in the sexual character of the blossoms, 
 at these two periods of time, seperated by an interval of "a 
 week or so," be accounted for, if it were not owing to the 
 presence of more than one variety in the bed? It is certain- 
 ly not explained by the adoption of Mr. Meehan's views; for 
 if those views be correct, no such sexual diversity ought 
 to have existed, — all the blossoms should have been pistillatfl 
 or all staminate, as all were subjected to the same cultivation. 
 Again, in allusion to the plant we received from him, he says 
 in his letter to the Committee : "It is a very weak plant as 
 you will perceive," &c. Then, according to the doctrine de- 
 veloped in his communication totheSeciety, it ought to have 
 produced pistillate blossoms; but it did not, they were all 
 either hermaphrodite or staminate. The remarks now made 
 we think are suffleient to invalidate any inferences drawn 
 from Mr. Meehan's experiments, since it has been shown 
 there is no certainty that the phmts employed in those ex- 
 periments, were genuine Hovey's Seedling. We regret that 
 our regard for Mr. Meehan prevented us from examining 
 the three plants when tlrcy were exhibited by him at the 
 March meeting of the Society. Had that been done, the 
 profitless discussion that has subsequently arisen, and which 
 has resulted in no little unkind feeling, might perhaps have 
 been obviated. But as we have now engaged in the inves- 
 tigation, we have subjected the plant sent to us by Mr. Mee- 
 han, to a careful and rigid examination to aseertiiin its gen- 
 uineness. And, after having made this examination, we are 
 prepared to say most emph.atieall.y, unreservedly and un- 
 equivocally, it is not a Hovey's Seedling. Should Mr. Mee- 
 han still be unconvinced that his experiments were 
 based on uncertain data, and consequently that any con- 
 clusions from them, hdwi'ver, legitimately drawn, are illogi- 
 cal and unreliable, we trust he will repeat them in such a 
 way as to avoid (he sources of error to which his former ones 
 are amenable. Let the plants, with which he may experi- 
 ment, by all means, be runners taken from one and the same 
 plant; wo shall then have conclusive evidence that they are 
 at least, all ono kind. And should he determine to continue 
 his experiments in this direction, we would also advise him 
 to obtain, if possible, runners from each of the three plants 
 exhibited by him in March last, and subjectsome of the run- 
 ners of each to his several modes of cultivation. The result 
 will either subst-antiate his doctrine, or satisfactorily prove 
 that these three plants were separate and distinct varieties, 
 possessing invariable, unchangeable and immutable sexual 
 characteristics, unalterable by cultivation, however diversifi- 
 ed by human sagacity. After the above was written, one of 
 the Committee received a communication from Mr. Meehan, 
 in which he infornis us that the three ]>lants exhibited by 
 him at the meeting of the Society, in March, 1853, "were 
 thrown away soon after the exhibition I having no idea that 
 there would ever be occasion to refer to them again." This 
 loss we regret. We learn, however, from Mr. Cope, that he 
 has three or four hundred jiots of [ilants, (taken it is to be 
 hoped from the same "new bed of Ilovey's Seedling,") in his 
 forcing house at this time; "and," he remarks, in a letter to 
 a member of the Committee, "however little dependence the 
 Committee may feel disposed to place in the statements con-
