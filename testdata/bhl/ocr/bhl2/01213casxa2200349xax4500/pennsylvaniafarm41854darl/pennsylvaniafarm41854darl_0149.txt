Diarrhcea and Colic are to a certain extent hereditary, in- 
 asmuch as they are very prone to attack horses of particular 
 form and constitution, as those with narrow loins, largo flat 
 sides, and of what is generally termed a washy appearance. 
 If such animals be worked, especially soon after being fed, 
 if their food be suddenly changed, or if they be allowed an 
 unusual quantity of fluid, they are almost certain to be at- 
 tacked either by purging or by colic. The tendency to these 
 diseases appears in such cases to depend on a want of ad- 
 justment among the different organs of the body ; a want of 
 balance among the difi"erent functions of digestion, circula- 
 sion, and respiration. 

Many farm horses, as well as others without much breed- 
 ing, are remarkable for consuming large quantities of food, 
 for soft and flabbj' muscular systems, and for round limbs 
 containing an unusual proportion of cellular tissue. These 
 characters are notoriously hereditary, of which indubitable 
 evidence is afforded by their existence in many different in- 
 dividuals of the same stock, and their long continuance, even 
 under the best management and most eflBcient systems of 
 breeding. Such characters indicate proclivity to certain 
 diseases, as swelled legs, weed, and grease. If horses of 
 this description stand long, the circulation of the blood 
 through the limbs is retarded ; for, as the contractions of the 
 muscles which materially aid circulation are wanting, the 
 blood in the veins rises with difficulty against its own gravi- 
 ty, while the soft and lax condition of the venous coats, and 
 of the muscles in contact with them, permits the passage of 
 the fluid parts of the blood, giving rise to a serous effusion 
 which is soft and pits on pressure. This anasarcous condi- 
 tion, although troublesome and frequently recurring, is easi- 
 ly removed by friction, exercise, or a little physic, and does 
 not unfit the animal fur ordinary work. 

But the same conformation and constitution which induce 
 simple swelled legs, also give rise to the more serious affec- 
 tion known as weed, or a shot of grease. This consists in a 
 disturbance of the balance which naturally subsists between 
 the waste of the system and the supply of new material to 
 repair that waste. Food is assimilated in larger quantity 
 than the wants of the system require, the chyle so formed 
 accumulates in the absorbent vessels and glands, which be- 
 come in consequence irritated and inflamed. That part of 
 the absorbent system situate in the hinder extremities is 
 usually the principal seat of the disease. The animal sud- 
 denly becomes lame, the inguinal and other glands in the 
 groin become enlarged and very painful, and the swelling 
 and pain gradually extend downwards along the course of 
 the absorbents, whilst the limb becomes a great deal larger 
 than its natural size. There is, at the same time, a good 
 deal of constitutional fever, with a full and bounding pulse. 
 The swelling of the leg is in the first instance inflammatory, 
 being hot and tender, and the skin over the part affected 
 hard and tense. Such swellings may by judicious treatment 
 be removed ; but, in cases of a chronic character, or where 
 the same limb has been previously affected, lymph is effused, 
 forming hard and nodulous and even diffuse swellings, which 
 often cause lameness by interfering with the motions of the 
 joints or tendons. These indurated swellings must be care- 
 fully distinguished from the serous effusions above noticed, 

which, although giving the animal an unsightly appearance, 
 do not materially impair his usefulness. 

Grease consists in a morbid condition of the sebaceoi's 
 glands of the horse's heels and fetlocks. It occurs in vari- 
 ous degrees of intensity ; sometimes as a mere scurfy itchi- 
 ness of the skin about the fetlocks, more commonly of the 
 hind extremities ; sometimes attended with much inflamma- 
 tion, causing great heat, pain, and swelling, and an ichorous 
 foetid discharge; sometimes causing falling off of the hair 
 about the heels, and the formation of deep cracks and fis- 
 sures ; and sometimes becoming so violent and inveterate as 
 to cause eversion of the sebaceous glands, formation of 
 granuliitions, and secretion of pus, constituting the loath- 
 some complaint termed the gropes. There are few diseases 
 better deserving the epithet of hereditary than grease, and 
 few in which the hereditary nature can be more easily dis- 
 covered and traced. Almost every practitioner can bring to 
 his recollection cases showing the tendency of this disease 
 to descend from parent to offspring. A friend of mine some 
 years ago purchased a valuable four year-old-entire horse, 
 adapted for agricultural purposes. When bought, he ap- 
 peared perfectly sound, and his limbs were nearly black, 
 well formed and fine; within a short time, however, they be- 
 came thick and greasy. And, although the mares to which 
 he was put were perfectly free from such faults, the progeny 
 have shown, in every case where they can be traced, unmis- 
 takeable evidence of their inheriting the greasy diathesis of 
 their sire. They have all been found liable to swelled legs 
 when they stand idle for a few days, most of them have been 
 the subjects of repeated attacks of weed, all are affected, 
 particularly in spring, with scurfiness of the skin of the hind 
 extremities and excessive itchiness, and lose at a very early 
 age their flatness and smoothness of limb. The faults occur 
 to a greater or less degree in all the stock of this horse by 
 many different mares, and are distinctly traceable to the 
 third generation. But, although grease is undoubtedly he- 
 reditary, and is therefore readily induced by comparatively 
 simple causes, still it is frequently caused, and is always ag- 
 gravated, by neglect of cleanliness, and of this there is am- 
 ple evidence in the fact, that it is most common in foul and 
 badly managed stables, and where no pains are taken to keep 
 the horses' feet and legs clean and dry. 

Inflammation is of two sorts, common and specific. These 
 differ from each other in their symptoms, their progress, and 
 their termination. Common inflammation is accompanied 
 by effusion of lymph and suppuration, has usually a particu- 
 lar seat or locality, is tolerably regular in its course, and 
 tends to a healthy termination : none are exempt from its 
 attacks, and it is seldom hereditary. It is exemplified in 
 the healing of wounds, and in the so-called phlegmasaj, as 
 pneumonia and pleurisy. Special or specific inflammation, 
 on the other hand, has peculiar symptoms, is not necessarily 
 localised, but may affect more or less the whole sj'stem, is 
 very variable in its course, not easily subdued by remedial 
 measures, and seldem entirely cured; not easily producedin 
 healthy subjects by extraneous causes, but producible by in- 
 oculation, occurring in animals of certain constitution, and 
 owing its dcvelopement in great part to hereditary predispo- 
 sition. There are three subdivisions of specific inflamma- 
 tion â€” the rheumatic, occurring in the various sorts of rheu- 
 matism, and nearly allied to it; the gouty, which, however, 
 is peculiar to man , the scrofulous or strumous, occurring in 
 pulmonary consumption ; and the syphylitic, also peculiar tn 
 man, but occurring in the horse in the form of glanders. In 
 the horse the two latter diatheses are more intimately con-
