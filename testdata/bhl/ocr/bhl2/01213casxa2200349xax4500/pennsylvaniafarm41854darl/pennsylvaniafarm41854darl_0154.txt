Principles of Breeding, or Crossing so as to Obtain a 
 Fixity of Type. 

In a recent number of the Journal of the lloyal Agri- 
 cultural Society of England, we rind some original views 
 ou the above subject in an es.say by M. M.^lingie-Nouel, 
 President of the Agricultural Society of Loire et Cher 
 in France, which are well worthy the attention of those 
 wishing to improve their stock. 

To ffei up and establish new characteristics iu a breed 
 of animals is a work of anxious years of effort, requi- 
 ring the very nicest observation and experiment. A sin- 
 gle false step may undo the work of years, and there is 
 no school in which skill and success is attainable but in 
 tliat of actual individual experience. It can neither be 
 taught in books nor be acquired from another, and as our 
 author lias remarked, can only be executed by a man 
 like Richard Goord, the founder of the new Kent breed 
 of sheep, who commences when very young, and lives, 
 like him, eighty-six years. 

There is one point in crossing animals on which he 
 lays great stress, and is so obvious as to excite wonder 
 that it has been lost sight of, viz : "that the principle of 
 antiquity or purity of race is what has most influence on 
 crosses," or, in other words, that where fixity of type 
 has resulted as a consequence of great antiquity of the 
 breed, the impress in the offspring will be stronger from 
 that side than where the breed is comparatively of re- 
 cent origin. A farmer wishing to secure for his herd the 
 fine milking qualities of the Alderney, would be far more 
 likely to secure his object by breeding his Alderney bull 
 to a common cow, or one of no distinct breed, than if he 
 xas to select a Devon cow, or even a pure Durham. The 
 common cow having no fixed and determined character- 
 istics of form or quality to counteract the impress of the 
 type, the influence of the mother on the offspring would 
 be weaker than that of the father. He illustrates the 
 pi-inciple by the motion of a projectile, say a common 
 ball, whose velocity is obtained not merely in proportion 
 to the propelling force, but also to the resistance of the 
 medium (air or water for example) through which the 
 body is driven. If there were no resistance on the side 
 of the mother, the complete effect would be realized by 
 the reproduction of the improving type, and the influ- 
 ence of the sire would be stronger, the purer and more 
 ancient the race might be. 

These principles he has applied most successfully to 
 improve the French breeds of sheep, which for various 
 causes had greatly deteriorated, and as they were of 
 great antiquity with very strongly developed character, 
 supposing the above principles to be correct, his entire 
 success is most remarkable. In reference to it he says : 
 "It appeared then that in order to untie the Gordian 
 knot whose threads I have traced, inasmuch as one could 
 not increase the purity and antiquity of the blood of the 
 rams (I purposely repeat the first principles of the prob- 
 lem to be solved), one must diminish the resisting power, 
 namely the purity and antiquity of the ewes. With a 
 view to this new experiment, one must procure English 

rams of the purest and most ancient race, and unite with 
 them French ewes of modern breeds, or rather of mixed 
 blood forming no distinct breed at all. It is easier than 
 one might have supposed to combine these conditions. 
 On the one hand, I selected some of the finest rams of 
 the New Kent breed, regenerated by Goord. On the 
 other hand, we find in France many border counties 
 lying between distinct breeds, in which district it is easy 
 to find flocks participating in the two neighboring races. 
 Thus, on the borders of Berry and La Sologne one meets 
 with flocks originally sprung from a mixture of the two 
 distinct races that are established in those two provinces. 
 Among these then I chose such animals as seemed least 
 defective, approaching, in fact, the nearest to, or rather 
 departing the least from, the form which I wished ulti- 
 mately to produce. These I united with animals of an- 
 other breed, picking out the best I could find on the bor- 
 ders of La Beauce and Touraine, which blended the 
 Tourangelle and native Merino blood of those other two 
 districts. From this mixture was obtained an offspring 
 combining the four races of Berry, Sologne, Touraine, 
 and Merino, without decided charactei*, without fixity, 
 with little intrinsic merit certainly, but possessing the 
 advantage of being used to our climate and management, 
 and bringing to bear on the new breed to be formed, an 
 influence almost annihilated by the multiplicity of its 
 component elements. 

"Now, what happens when one puts such mixed-blood 
 ewes to a pure New Kent ram? One obtains a lamb 
 containing fifty hundredths of the purest and most ancient 
 English blood, with twelve and a half hundredths of four 
 different French races, which are individually lost in the 
 pi'eponderance of English blood, and disappear almost 
 entirely, leaving the improving type in the ascendant. 
 The influence, in fact, of this type was so decided and 
 so predominant, that all the lambs produced strikingly 
 resembled each other, and even Englishmen took them 
 for animals of their own country. But, wliat was still 
 more decisive, when these young ewes and rams were put 
 together, they produced lambs closely resembling them- 
 selves, without any marked return to the features of the 
 old French races from which the grandmother ewes were 
 derived. Some slight traces only might perhaps be de- 
 tected here and there by an experienced eye. Even 
 these, however, soon disappeared, such animals as show- 
 ed them being carefully weeded out of the breeding 
 flock. This may certainly be called "fixing a breed," 
 when it becomes every year more capable of reproducing 
 itself with uniform and marked features. Such was my 
 secret, which, however, has been made no secret at all, 
 but has been declared from the first in my entries at the 
 shows of Poissy and Versailles. Such is the origin of 
 the La Charmoise breed of sheep. 

"We have already seen how important it is that you 
 should not infuse into a new breed more than fifty per 
 cent, of English blood, if you would preserve the French 
 constitution, which alone suits the circumstances in 
 which they have to pass their lives. The Chai-moise 
 breed not exceeding that proportion does retain the 
 hardiness of a pure French race : the lambs are reared as 
 easily as those of any French breed, getting over the 
 summer just as easily; neither then nor later do they suf- 
 fer more than our native breeds from heat or fromdrought.
