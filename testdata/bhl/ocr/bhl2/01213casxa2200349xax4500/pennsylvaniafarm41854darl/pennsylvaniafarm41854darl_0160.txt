in appearance as presented to the eye, but it was quite 
 perceptible in all the lots. No. 1 was the poorest, prob- 
 ably four or five bushels to the acre less in quantity than 
 the best ; No. 2 in the guanoed part came next ; No. 3 
 on the compost part was better than No. 2, but No. 4 
 was the best wheat in the field. The whole field turned 
 off 798 bushels of wheat, or thirty-one bushels to the 
 acre. 

The field is now in clover, and should there be any 
 difference in the quantity of grass on the parts manured, 
 I may give you the result hereafter. E. J. D.

The Cowkeeping Ant. 

Mr. Darlington : — I have before me a highly inter- 
 esting little volume lately published in London, entitled 
 the "History of Insects," giving the best summary ac- 
 count of the recent discoveries in the science. It amply 
 deserves republication in this country. I propose to 
 abridge from it an account of a tribe of ants, altogether 
 new to me, which keep cows ! It appeared at first sight 
 so much like a romance, however, that I have turned to 
 several standard authors on the subject, and find it fully 
 confirmed. 

They keep and feed certain insects, from which they 
 extract a sweet and nutritious liquid, in the same man- 
 ner as we obtain milk from cows. There are two species 
 of insects from which the ant tribe abstract this juice, 
 the aphides, or plant lice, and gall insects. Linnagus 
 and, after him, other naturalists have called these insects 
 the milch cattle of ants, and the term is not inapplicable. 
 An attentive observer may see them ascending trees to 
 milk their cows, the aphides. The substance here called 
 milk is a sweetish fluid, which these plant-lice secrete, 
 resembling honey in taste, and which issues from very 
 small tubes or teats. After they have sucked the sap of 
 the tree or plant on which they reside, the ants milk 
 them with their antennae with much the same motion as 
 is employed by a milk maid, making them yield the li- 
 quid at pleasure. Thus it proceeds from one of its cows 
 to another till satiated. These cows are the property of 
 tribes, and are kept much after'the fashion of the ani- 
 mal so extremely useful to man; sometimes they remove 
 them from their native place and domesticate them in 
 their own habitations, affording, as Huber justly ob- 
 serves, an example of almost human industry and saga- 
 city ; other species, which do not gather the plant-lice 
 together in their own nests, still seem to consider them 
 as private property, they set sentinels to protect their 
 places of resort, and drive away other ants, and what 
 is still more extraordinary, they enclose them as a far- 
 mer does his sheep, to preserve them not only from rival 
 ants, but also from the natural enemies of the aphis. 
 They construct round the branch on which their cattle 
 are feeding, an inclosui-e of earth, or some other mate- 
 rial, thus securing them from wandering and from inter- 
 lopers. 

The brown ant has been observed by Huber to build a 
 chamber round the stem of a thistle, in such a way that 
 the stalk passed through the centre, so that from their 
 ant-hill they had only to climb the thistle stalk in order 
 to enter their cattle fold. The interior, smooth and com- 
 pact, was entirely formed of earth ; it contained an ex- 

tensive familj' of insect cows, but he remarks such ex- 
 hibitions are not conmion. 

In winter the .ants would be exposed to the horrors of 
 a famine did they not rely tor food on their cattle. Their 
 milch cows are then kept on the roots of the trees which 
 penetrate the interior of the nest, aud furnish au abun- 
 dant supply of the liquid in which their keepers delight. 
 And not only is the full grown animal kept, but its eggs 
 are watched and guarded with that care which warrants 
 us in supposing that the ants know their full value. Ir 
 order to have an early spring supply of milk, the eggs 
 are deposited in the warmest part of their dwelling. 

To the naturalist we have probably related nothing new, 
 but to the general reader we may have promulgated a new 
 idea. At all events, we shall be rewarded for our trou- 
 ble of abridgement, if we turn the attention of a single 
 student of nature's laws to the highly interesting and 
 now fashionable study of natural history. J. S. G.

For the Farm Journ.nl 

Mr. Editor: — Can any of the readers of the "Jour- 
 nal" inform me of thQ. time to girdle gum trees that it 
 will kill them? I have frequently girdled them, but 
 without success. 

If any of my friends hfive cattle that are not hearty, 
 or appear as if they had a touch of the "hollow horn," 
 feed them poke root, a piece four or five inches long and 
 three-fourths of an inch thick ; feed two or three times 
 a week; cut fine and mix with potatoes, and chop 
 so that they will eat it. Occasionally feeding poke root, 
 say once a week, will keep your cattle hearty and good 
 feeders. I have a yoke of oxen that tln-ee winters ago 
 were almost on the "lift." A friend told me to feed them 
 poke root as above, and they would soon be right enough. 
 I did, and the result was satisfactory. It is an excellent 
 preventive and well worth trying. Ask your doctor, and 
 he will explain more fully, than is necessary for me to 
 do here, its medicinal properties — it is next to Sarsapa- 
 rilla. In haste, yours with respect, B. M. E. 

American Fomological Society. 

The fifth session of this National Association will be 
 held at Horticultural Hall, in the City of Boston, 
 Massachusetts, commencing on Wednesday, the thir- 
 teenth day of September next, at ten o'clock, A. M. 

It is intended to make this assemblage one of the most 
 interesting that has ever been held in this country, on 
 the subject of Pomology. All Horticultural, Agricultu- 
 ral and other kindred Associations, of North v^mei'ica, 
 are therefore requested to send such number of Dele- 
 gates to this Convention, as they may deem expedient. 

Pomologists, Nurserymen, and all others interested in 
 the cultivation of good fruit, are also invited to attend 
 the coming session. 

Among the objects of this Society are the following : 

To ascertain, from practical experience, the relative 
 value of varieties in different parts of our widely ex- 
 tended country. To hear the Reports of the various 
 State Fruit Committees, and from a comparison of re- 
 sults, to learn what fruits are adapted to general culti- 
 vation ; what varieties are suitable for particular locali- 
 ties ; what new varieties give promise of being worthy
