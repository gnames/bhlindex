 generally inferior or worthless, in all parts of the 
 Union. 

In order to facilitate these objects, and to collect and 
 diffuse a knowledge of researches and discoveries in the 
 science of Pomology, Members and Delegates are re- 
 quested to contribute specimens of the fruits of their re- 
 spective districts ; also papers descriptive of their art of 
 cultivation ; of diseases and insects injurious to vegeta- 
 tion ; of remedies for the same, and whatever may add 
 to the interest and utility of the Association. 

The Massachusetts Horticultural Society has gener- 
 ously offered to provide accommodations for the Society, 
 and also to publish its proceedings free of expense. 

All packages of fruit intended for exhibition may 
 therefore be addressed as follows : — "For the American 
 PoMOLOGiCAL SOCIETY, Horticultural Hall, School Street, 
 Boston, Mass. ;" where a Committee will be in attendance 
 to take charge of the same. 

All Societies to be represented will please forward cer- 
 tificates of their several delegations, to the President of 
 the American Pomological Society, at Boston.

Erroneous Opinions of the Ancients Jiespecting Lime — Its

Mr. Editor : — Without preliminaries wo will proceed to 
 the history of Lime : 

Von Helmet, a nobleman and chemist of the latter part of 
 the 15th century, supposed lime took on an acid while it was 
 burning, from which it derived its caustic properties. (The 
 very, reverse was the case, since it is known to give oflF an 
 acid in this operation.) He thought it probable that sul- 
 phuric acid, in small quantities, was absolved, as this acid 
 was very corroding, and might impart corroding properties 
 to the lime. And since sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) was 
 known to become heated when mixed with water, so it made 
 the lime hard when immersed in water. 

In 1676 Ludovice, a Gothic physician of Heimar, refuted 
 this theory, without, however, establishing any other in its 
 stead. 

In 1659 Frantz de le Bol Sylvius, a doctor of Leydon, 
 spoke especially upon this subject. He first pointed out the 
 difference between effervesence and fermentation, and ob- 
 served that the sweet smell of lime, when heated under 
 water, was different from either. But this much took place 
 in the operation of the water, viz : it lost its fire material, 
 &c. 

A. Lemarc, a chemist and physician of Paris in the latter 
 part of the 16th century, explained the effect of caustic lime 
 upon potash, in which the latter become caustic by suppo- 
 sing it received from the lime a "fire material." 

In a treatise before the Paris Academy of Natural Sciences 
 in 1709, he still maintained the same views. He considered 
 the fire material was really a material substance, which had 
 weight, but which could penetrate all vessels. (An idea 
 with some semblance to that of modern times, that heat is a 
 material substance ; and it may be proven during the next 
 hundred years that we now stand, in our relation to heat, aa 
 did the ancients, at the period I speak, with respect to a sub- 
 ject so simple (now) as that of converting the carbonates 
 into the caustic state.) 

He considered the change of weight in burning was due 
 to the calcinating of the metals in the substances. The 
 metal of lime he considered was very closely allied to that 
 of potash, except that in lime the fire material was more 
 firmly bound, since the potash imparted all its fire material 
 to water, and the lime did not. Those substances only which, 
 contained fire material, and which imparted it easily to or- 
 ganic substances when placed in contact with them, were 
 called caustic. 

Homberg endorsed the same idea. (Ilomberg was of Sax- 
 on origin, born 1652 in Batavia. At an early ago he se- 
 lected the study of law ; he studied in Jena, Leipsic and 
 Prague, and commenced practice at the age of 22 in Magde- 
 burg. Here he become interested in the natural sciences. 
 His attention was first directed to botany, then to astrono- 
 my and the physical sciences generally, in which he was as- 
 sisted by the far famed Otto Von Guerike, who yras then 
 Mayor of the city. He finally became so interested in sci- 
 ence that he abandoned the practice of law, and went to 
 Italy, where he visited several important places to prosecute 
 his studies. He hero studied medicine, and afterwards went 
 to England, where he became interested in chemistry, in 
 which science he made several important discoveries.) In a 
 memoir before the Paris Academy of Natural Sciences in 
 1700, he made observations on the neutralization of acids by 
 means of the earths, and gave a reason for the causticity of 
 lime. He afterwards maintained that the loss of weight 
 through burning could only be explained by the substance 
 taking on a fire material. 

In 1677 Kunkle, an associate of the last gentleman, said 
 that the alkalies were made caustic by the action of lime 
 through the instrumentality of a corrosive substance that it 
 contained, and imparted to them ; he called this corrosivo 
 substance an acid. 

And Stahl in 1702 spoke of the causticity of lime, and 
 considered that it was owing to a fixed fire that it contain- 
 ed. 

Here the history of lime runs through about 100 pages 
 that are devoted to the phlogistic theory, which name (phlo- 
 giston) applied to this fire material, and which theory was 
 admitted by the chemists for over 100 years, but it is now 
 entirely abandoned. It is not deemed necessary to follow 
 the author through these details. Suffice it to say that Stahl 
 dwelt particularly upon the separation of the water from the 
 lime by heat, and thus the fire was fixed in the place of the 
 water, and when it united with water again to form what he 
 considered a body similar to a salt, it gave off this fire. One 
 of his scholars sought in 1726 to prove that a caustic alkali 
 onli/ could be obtained by bringing it in contact with sub- 
 stances that had previously been exposed to fire. Others of 
 his students sought to prove that the causticity, produced in 
 the alkalies (as those in ashes) by caustic lime, was depen- 
 dent upon causes much more closely allied to what is now 
 known to be the truth. One of them says all salts contain, 
 as was maintained by Stahl, a primitive acid. However, the 
 ley salts (as common potash and soda, which are obtained by 
 boiling a ley solution down,) which are alkaline, contain less 
 of this acid. The tartrate of potash (cream of tartar) con- 
 tained a portion of this acid, which, when the salt was mix- 
 ed with caustic lime, was withdrawn by the lime, and the 
 substance became caustic. (By adding a little finely pow- 
 dered common limestone to a hot solution of cream of tartar, 
 this experiment may bo performed; part of the acid of the 
 bitartrato goes to the lime, and the cream of tartar thus 
 loses its sour taste.) But most of the chemists of that time 
 adopted the more erroneous idea, that the causticity of lime 
 was owing to something that come out of the fire, and united 
 with it. Others were even more absurd, in supposing that
