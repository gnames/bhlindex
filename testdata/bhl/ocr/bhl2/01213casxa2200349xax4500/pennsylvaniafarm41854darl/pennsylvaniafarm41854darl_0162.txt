burnt liino contained a biting acid, something to which it 
 owed its causticity. 

As lato as 1749 the difference between caustic .and carbon- 
 ated substances was not recognised. They had observed the 
 effervcsence of lime when heated with acids, but supposed it 
 was merely a mechanical effort, without recognising the es- 
 cape of the gas that passed off. 

Some men, it is true, did, at times, appear to be just on the 
 eve of seizing the truth, but amid the thousands of spec- 
 ulations thiit enveloped them, and the absence of the means 
 of experimenting, nothing was established so satisfactorily 
 as to take the precedence of error. 

Thus after a period of over 1800 years through which we 
 have glanced at the history of lime, in which hundreds of 
 philosophers had expended their wisdom in examining it, 
 we find the scientific world, less than 100 years ago, almost 
 as ignorant of its composition as the man who first used it 
 for making mortar. Had wo time wo might consider a cor- 
 responding series of erroneous ideas, relative to the nature of 
 carbonic acid, which enters into the composition of lime- 
 Stone ; a pretty general idea was that it p.artook of the na- 
 ture of sulphur, and was by some called spirit of sulphur. 
 But toward the latter end of the last century all these theo- 
 ries received their death blow through the investigations of 
 the immortal Lavoiser, who dealt a final stroke to alchemy, 
 and taught the world the legitimate object of chemistry. 
 Heretofore nothing had been learned that is of anv '- 
 tance to-day, except as a historical illustration of „.ie im- 
 mense amount of effort required to learn what now appears 
 to be the n:ost simple facts. Yours, <fec., E. P.

 HIGH FARMING. 
 As there may be some who have not heard of this new 
 form of agriculture, we will explain that it is understood 
 to mean an attempt to make land produce more than na- 
 ture ever designed it should yield, by large outlays of 
 money and small expenditure of thought or judgment. 
 The surface of the earth has been again and again torn 
 to pieces and brutally ill used, by conceited and ignorant 
 persons, under the delusion that they were practising 
 the art of agriculture. Poets, in the waywardness of 
 their imaginations ; philosophers, led away in the mys- 
 tification of some theory ; patriots, who have heard the 
 adage that ' 'he is tlie greatest man Avho makes two blades 
 of grass grow where only one grew before," and deter- 
 mined to have the approbation of their own consciences, 
 even if ridiculed by their fellow counti-ymen ; philan- 
 thropists, who carry their heads loaded with as many 
 schemes as a spider's bag has ; young merchants and 
 tradesmen worn with the fatigue of day books and 
 ledgers, and perhaps disgusted with their own art, and 
 with those, too, of their competitors in the career of 
 avarice and accumulation, turn their impatient energies 
 to try the mild and uncomplaining earth, and vent upon 
 her bosom all the dreams and delusions a fevered brain 
 can invent. Such men delight in being called "far- 
 mers." There is a solid strength in the sound, .an idea 
 of enduring vigor, and of usefulness, that captivates 
 their inexperience. Men, whose ideas of the art of hus- 
 bandry never extended beyond the unthinking consump- 
 tion of its pi'oducts, and who had never regarded those 
 who practised it as more than a body of heavy heeled 
 and coarse witted plowmen, are suddenly transported 
 ■with visions of green fields and babbling brooks, and by 

some juggle of the fancy feel as if transformed into har- 
 dy yeomen. 

Under such an impulse they purchase a landed estate, 
 probably for much more than it is worth, and immedi- 
 ately with an air of resolution and most courageous de- 
 fiance of all advice, go to work. The idea that seems to 
 give their hearts buoyancy and encouragement is, that 
 they have a patent for making land produce. Whence 
 or how this invention W'as hit upon is a mystery they do 
 not choose to unfold, but certain are they that it is in- 
 fallable. 

With this Idnd of inspired agricultural genius, and 
 with the consciousness of an intuitive knowledge of the 
 whole art of husbandry, these persons give up their 
 counting houses, turn their backs, and march forth with 
 full purses and empty heads, to try a new career in life. 
 What is the result, and what is proved by the daring and 
 ostentatious experiment : that they have, by every 
 means in their power, trumpeted forth with as great a 
 flourish as if they had already developed some new pow- 
 er in nature, or met a triumph in the discovery of some 
 new laws. For the first year they seem, in their own 
 conceit to be magicians. The grass grows, the gi-ain 
 iii'i*-i*,s. calves are born and chickens are hatched, with, 
 .„ tiicm, many other things equally new, strange and 
 wonderful. These mysterious movements they ascribe 
 to their magical art. They see the sweeps of their wand 
 in the crops and the harvest, in the unusually rapid 
 growth of little pigs and young chickens, and are i-eady 
 like the illustrious Mi\ Sampson to exclaim, "Prodigi- 
 ous !" 

The first year of their attempt to enlighten the world, 
 and to prove, not only the simplicity of the art of hus- 
 bandry, but that all who have heretofore practised it 
 were consummate dunces, passes under much excitement, 
 and that not disagreeable agitation, that comes from the 
 brain being tickled with new and unusual ideas. Even 
 the day of reckoning, and the closing up of the annual 
 accounts, is got over with more than usual fortitude ; 
 there is on their countenances even a smile of power, as 
 if they had done a deed, so judicious, so courageous and 
 so manly, that not only their own hearts and consci- 
 ences upheld it, but that it merits the lofty approbation 
 of public applause. 

The second year is entered on with a feeling of con- 
 tent and benignant satisfiiction. The excitement at the 
 majestic movements of nature is somewhat softened, 
 but there is still a sense of wonder that their things 
 should grow, and a yet lingering impression that the 
 whole is due to the earth and the seed being theirs. An- 
 other settlement comes round. Multitudinous bills and 
 multifarious demands, with a seemingly immovable and 
 inaccessible mountain pile of things yet to be done, looming 
 throug,!., an imrenninerative and extravagant future, not 
 a little shakes, and at least causes to vibrate, the stern 
 resolution of the transformed aspirant to agricultural 
 glory. A malicious looker on might remark a slight lack 
 of ambition's sterner stuff. But all is gone through, 
 though there is a little contraction of the brow, .an in- 
 considerable anxiety of respiration, with a nervous 
 shrinking from the shrill echo of '. subsiding purse. 

In a year or two more the Lscomfiture is complete; he 
 who undertook to teach f.uds that he has begun to learn;
