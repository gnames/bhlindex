THE DROP WORM. 

A, male larva ; B, female larva and case ; C, male pupa in 
 the case ; D, suspended female case ; E, male pupa protru- 
 ding from the case ; F, male imago; G, female pupa; H, fe- 
 male imago ; I, ova. 

Note. — B is represented as laying on the ground, and 
 about returning to the tree again by a fine silken cord fas- 
 tened above. H should be somewhat larger in proportion to 
 the other figures — the drawing was made from a retarded 
 specimen. In F the antennae should beproportionably some- 
 what smaller. J and K are of no account at present. 

For a more extended reference to this worm, we beg to re- 
 fer our readers to an article by our esteemed correspondent 
 S. S. Rathvon, Esq., on page 111 (April No.) of the present 
 volume. We designed the engraving to accompany the ar- 
 ticle, but could not get the work done in season. 

Strawberry Question in the West. 

It would seem by the following extract from the proceed- 
 ings of the Cincinnati Horticultural Society, that entire 
 harmony does not reign, even at "head quarters," on the 
 Question. 

The minutes being read, were passed as appeared. Mr. 
 Jas. W. Ward was called upon, and read a paper on the straw- 
 berry question, in which he gave a very distinct account of 
 the botanical character of the plant, and also the peculiar 
 abnormal characters of some varieties. He claimed that 
 all aberrations from the normal type of the genus, are 
 accidental and liable to revert to the original form — a posi- 
 tion that was questioned by the members. The reader 
 objected to the word Bioici as applied to the Strawberry, 
 also to that of the word 2)i9tillate for what have been called 
 female or pistillate flowers, all have rudimentary stamens. 
 He alluded to the abuse of the word fruit, which is botani- 
 cally applied to the seed proper ; he cited several fruits 
 that were developed and eatable, though devoid of proper 
 seed. Hero it was objected that whatever might bo the law 
 with other plants, it was not so with the Strawberry, which 
 always swelled in proportion to the perfectness of the seeds 
 or fruit proper. Some discussion ensued, when it was or- 
 dered that the paper be put on file, and a copy tendered to 
 the Horticultural lievieic for publication. I 

"Shortening-in" Peach Trees. 

All writers on the subject agree that "the Peach of all 
 other trees, is one that from its mode of growth and bearing 
 requires constant pruning to'maintain it in a shapely, thrif- 
 ty and productive state." This is explained by the author 
 of the "Fruit Garden" as follows : — The sap of the peach 
 tree tends powerfully to the extremities of the shoots, more 
 so than in any other fruit tree. The buds that do not push 
 and form shoots the first season after their formation, are 
 lost ; they cannot, as in most other trees, be excited into 
 growth ; and hence it is that the lower parts become so rap- 
 idly denuded of young wood, and that trees left to them- 
 selves for six or seven years, are in a measure worn out or 
 worthless. 

It is a fact that must always be kept in view by cultiva- 
 tors of the peach, that "the fruit is borne only on wood of 
 the preceding year ; and consequently one of the great ob- 
 jects of the pruning, is to keep all parts of the tree fur- 
 nished with a regular and constant succession of annual 
 bearing shoots." 

The Shortening-in mode of pruning has been found most 
 successful in accomplishing this. It consists in yearly cut- 
 ting back the extremities, so as to counteract the spread of 
 the limbs, and induce more frequent branches. In a young 
 tree, for instance the growth of a year consist of shoots all 
 over the top or outside of the tree, from a foot or two feet 
 long. In a beiiring tree there will be one or two wood buds 
 at the base, and two or three more near the top and termi- 
 nating the shoot. The remainder, a dozen or more in num- 
 ber — will be fruit buds, and if untouched will probably bear, 
 destroying the wood buds at the base and pushing out at 
 the extremity, new shoots, but weak, in consequence of the 
 quantity of the fruit below them. At the end of the season, 
 the shoot of last year will show a long, vacant space, with- 
 out a young shoot or living bud, and in this way the centre 
 of the tree soon contains only bare limbs, and the vigor of 
 the tree is wasted by over production. 

When the shoots are shortened one-half, or thereabouts, the 
 sap is retained in their lower parts, one half the fruit buds 
 are removed; and those that remain produce larger and bet- 
 ter fruit ; the lower wood buds produce vigorous shoota to 
 bear next year, taking the place of those which have already
