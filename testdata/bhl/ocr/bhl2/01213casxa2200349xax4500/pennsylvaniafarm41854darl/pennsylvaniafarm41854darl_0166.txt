[Mat 

borne In this way, regular uniform crops of large and fine 
 fruit are produced, and a succession of young shoots kept 
 up. "If this pruning," says Thomas, "is regularly and 
 annually performed," the head of the tree will be preserved 
 in an even and compact shape, and in a healthy and vigor- 
 ous condition ; amd it will rarely become necessary to short- 
 en and thin out the limbs by cutting back the larger side 
 branches." 

Something may be done for large, neglected trees, by an 
 intelligent operator. They will have a head composed of 
 long, branchless limbs, and consequently an open centre. 
 The fruit will be produced on the ends of the limbs, and the 
 tree become tall and enfeebled from over bearing and a con- 
 stant succession of terminal shoots. The proper shortening- 
 in is performed by cutting back the principal limbs, three or 
 four feet — taking care to do so just above a considerable 
 side branch, which leaves no stump, and causes the wood 
 soon to heal over. Such pruning will, in a year or two con- 
 vert the unshapely and unproductive tree into a compact and 
 vigorous one, improving the fruit exceedingly. The tree 
 will throw out a new head of healthy bearing wood, and 
 trees, "given up by the doctors" as superanuated and worn 
 out, have thus regained their youth again, — good at least for 
 half a dozen years' fresh service. Some cultivators operate 
 on only one side of the tree in a year. This does not pre- 
 vent the bearing of the other side, and next year the side 
 cut will be ready for fruiting. Early in spring is the proper 
 time for this, as well as most other pruning* — /. H. Bixhy,

Cause and Cure of the Potato Sot. 

Mr. Andrew Smith, of Clarkesburg, Erie county, N. Y., 
 has written a letter to the Genessee Farmer, in which he 
 says that the rotting of potatoes planted for seed causes the 
 crop growing therefrom to decay prematurely. To cure or 
 prevent the malady, he removes the seed potatoes before 
 the young tubers are formed ; by which he supposes that no 
 infection is permitted to pass from the rotting old potato to 
 the new one. This plan was first tried by Mr. S. in 1851 ; 
 and if we understand him aright, it has since been tried 
 with equal success. Where the parent tuber does not rot, 
 Mr. S. says that its oflfspring are sound. His theory is in- 
 genious, and deserving of the attention of Agricultural So- 
 cieties. 

Suckering Corn. 

G. Blight Browne, Esq., in an article in the Plough, Loom 
 and Anvil, on the history and growth of Indian Corn, con- 
 cludes as follows with respect to suckering: 

Suckers (properly speaking) take rise from the stalk below 
 the ground, and are capable under some circumstances to 
 become complete plants, producing stalk, tassel, and silk; 
 and, no doubt, if the climate would favor the enterprise, 
 would bear ears. In the natural climate of the maize, grown 
 on a soil undrained of its fertility by husbandry, and in the 
 natural state, unimproved by cultivation and art, it may be 
 able to furnish to the sucker, or second growth, suflScient 
 nutriment to bring it to maturity. But in our climate, and 
 limited by one short season, no such result must be expected. 
 Maize has been by cultivation much enlarged in the grain, 
 and greater number of grains are found on the cob of our 
 cultivated varieties, than originally grew on the natural 
 plant. The great desideratum of the Northern farmer is to 
 make his corn in the allotted time, and to have his crop well 
 matured before our early frosts. We have usually no time 
 to lose, and there can be no doubt that any treatment which 
 would retard the maturing of the ear, would not be a good 
 one. 

Shoots from the nodes above ground can not do much, if 
 any harm, to the plants, because they are soon arrested in 
 their growth. The stripping of these shoots will occasion 
 a very bad wound, and is calculated to do more injury than 
 good. 

The case is very different with the under-ground shoot or 
 sucker. They derive their sap from the roots of the parent 
 plant, and consequently divert the supply, at amoment when 
 it is most needed to assist in proereation, then going on in 
 the parent plant. Nothing should be allowed to interfere 
 with this function, as the early maturing of the seed de- 
 pends on the vigor with which this process is prosecuted. 

Therefore, on the whole, I should conclude that the shoots 
 or suckers which start from the nodes above ground, should 
 not be removed; and that those which have their origin below 
 ground should be removed. 

American Wool. 

The British Commissioners of the Great Exhibition of 
 1851, have determined to form, in London, a grand univer- 
 sal trade-museum. Mr. Solby, their agent, has applied to 
 Mr. P. A. Browne, of Philadelphia, to ascertain how they 
 will be able to procure for it all the leading varieties of the 
 best American fleece; and Mr. Browne has recommended 
 this direct appe.il in their behalf to the sheep-breeders and 
 wool-growers of the United States. Any one disposed to 
 countenance this laudable design will be pleased, with as 
 little delay as possible, to forward specimens to Mr. Browne, 
 post-paid. 

Each sample ought to be accompanied with the name and 
 address of the doner, and also of the breeder, where he is 
 not the donor; the name of the species, variety, or breed of 
 both parents or ancestors of the animal from which the spe- 
 cimen is taken; the age, sex, probable weight, and amount 
 and date of last clip, and the number of the flock to which he 
 belongs, &c. All specimens, when practicable, should be 
 drawn out, (not cut,) and be taken from the back, six inches 
 in the rear of the neck. 

Editors of agricultural periodicals and of newspapers are 
 respectfully requested to insert this notice.

Feeding Poultry. 

Professor Gregory of Aberdeen, in a letter to a friend, ob- 
 serves: — "As I suppose you keep poultrj-, Imaj' tell you that 
 it has been ascertained that if you mix with their food a suf- 
 ficient quantity of egg-shells or chalk, which they eat greedi- 
 ly, they will lay twice or thrice as many eggs as before. A 
 well-fed fowl is disposed to lay a large number of eggs, but 
 cannot do so without the materials of the shells, however 
 nourishing in other respects her food may be; indeed, a fowl 
 fed on- food and water, free from carbonate of lime, and not 
 finding any in the soil, or in the shape of mortar, which 
 they often eat on the walls, would lay no eggs at all with the 
 best will in the world." — Ux. 

Cabbages. 
 A correspondent of the Horticulturist says: — "It may not 
 be generally known that cabbages readilj' grow and are 
 easily propagated by slips. A stump may be put out in the 
 spring and the sprouts as they vegetate cut ofiP, the cut al- 
 lowed to dry, and then planted. When cabbages or cauli- 
 flowers throw off side shoots they may be used in the same 
 way. Cabbages thus raised have short stalks, and are sure 
 of being true to the parent. I have often pursued this 
 method when short of seed."
