 which is that of tea or sage ; the fibre or straw is much 
 finer and of a softer feel than that made from the ripe 
 corn — the color of which is red, or inclining to red."

"Guenon's System and James Gowen." 

Mk. Editor : — Mr. Gowen writes with so much abili- 
 ty, making everything so very clear which before looked 
 very decidedly muddy, that I fear to even venture a few 
 remarks in reply to his last. My employments have led 
 me hitherto only among the shallow streams of knowl- 
 edge, while it is very evident Mr. Gowen has been accus- 
 tomed to plunging among the deep waters, and di-awing 
 his inspirations from the accumulated wisdom, and pro- 
 lific fountains of past and present ages. 

To my friends, who have charged me with temerity in 
 venturing a contest on paper with such a veteran as Mr. 
 Gowen, where to be worsted was a certainty at the first, 
 I must only say I wished to benefit the farming interest, 
 and also hoped to shelter myself behind our friend Lord 
 Bacon, whose method of reasoning I thought Mr. Gowen 
 had departed from. 

Since your last number, Mr. Editor, I have been look- 
 ing over my books and historical charts, and find such a 
 man did live as Lord Bacon, and that he was the author 
 of the philosophy I then adverted to, called the inductive 
 philosophy. Mr. Gowen, in his last, says, "Had any 
 such tests, as are claimed for Guenon's mirrors, existed, 
 they could not, in the nature of things, have possibly es- 
 caped the observations of such keen, practical and dis- 
 cerning men as Bakewell, CuUey, Whitaker, Youatt, 
 &c." 

By a parity of reasoning, if the present uses and ap- 
 plications of steam power, the daguei-reotype process, 
 the improvements in the healing art of the last fifty 
 years, and various others in the arts and sciences, were 
 not discovered by Dr. Franklin, Sir Isaac Newton, the 
 elder, (not the one in Chesnut street,) and the philoso- 
 phers of past ages, they are not facts now, and Mr. 
 Gowen don't believe them. It was not known to the 
 wise men of old that the earth turned round. Does it, 
 therefore, Mr. Editor, stand still? Is not this the reduc- 
 tio ad absurdum to which Mr. Gowen's reasoning leads ? 
 Are we not learning new things every day ? Have we 
 reached the point yet in any thing that human intelli- 
 gence and investigation may be said to be unable to go 
 further. 

I asked Mr. Gowen to show the "physiological connec- 
 tion between a light nose, thin neck, thin tail, points 
 which he considers of value, and the lactescent organs of 
 the animal." If he camiot show this connection, neither 
 must he object to Gueuon's marks, because we are una- 
 , ble to show their physiological connection. The fact is, 
 we are obliged to admit the truth of things we see around 
 us daily, which we cannot conipi-ehend or fathom, the 
 whole world above, ai'ound, below, is all full of mystery, 
 and with submission to Mr. James Gowen, it is no argu- 
 ment against a fact that we cannot understand it. 

There is but one other point in his last communication 
 worth adverting to. He says, "I should have designa- 
 ted the Societies in France, who examined Guenon's the- 
 , cry and subjected it to such severe tests." 

This is indeed astonishing, and seems to pi-ove what I 
 before thought, that Mr. Gowen has not even read Gue- 
 non's book, to say nothing about making himself master 
 of the system. I have never yet seen an edition of Gue- 
 non, which does not contain the very certificates and en- 
 dorsements of the learned Societies in France I alluded 
 to, with the localities, mode of examination, award of 
 premiums to Guenon for his discovery and all about it. 

Notwithstanding all Mr. Gowen has said, I am still a 
 believer in the SCIENCE.

Guenon's System Sustained by Facts. 
 At a public sale of fifteen dairy cows, sold by J. H. 
 KiNNARD on the 15th inst., in West Whiteland township, 
 (within four miles of West Chester,) fourteen of them 
 averaged $42 44 cents; the highest priced one being 
 $58 50; her calf sold ofi" two weeks previous brought $14, 
 making $72 50. Not a bad price, considering she, with 
 the other high priced ones, were selected on Guenon's 
 system. How is it that the best marked cows, accord- 
 ing to Guenon's rule, always bring the highest prices at 
 our public sales, and are always sold by the owner as 
 the best cows he has ? Can the disbeliever in Guenon 
 answer? T.

The Deciduous Cypress and the Pecan Nut. 
 To the Editor of the Farm Journal — Dear Sir: — In a 
 recent number, you made an enquiry of me concerning 
 the large cypress at Bartram, to which I am happy in 
 being able to reply. This tree is not so large as it is 
 represented to be in Loudon's Arboretum, as will be seen 
 by a comparison with his figures, and the measurements 
 given in my recent "Hand Book of Ornamental Trees;" 
 but it is, nevertheless, a magnificent tree. The soil and 
 situation in which it is growing, corresponds, in some 
 degree, with its naturally most favorable conditions of 
 growth. Formerly — before the cutting of the Baltimore 
 railroad in the vicinity — a strong spring issued near its 
 base, and, flowing over a bed of mica, fomied something 
 akin to a swamp, on which the English ground ivy, 
 (glechoma hedcracea,) the marsh pennywort, [Ilydrocotyle 
 Americana,) and similar swamp plants flourished. These 
 collecting as it were the leaves of the cypress and the 
 pines in the vicinity, formed a situation very like its 
 natural one, and, no doubt, contributed to its large 
 size. The "knees" thrown up by our specimen, are not 
 so large as those found in their native places of growth, 
 few exceeding one foot in height — a fact which may lead 
 us to a knowledge of the true ofiice of these peculiar 
 productions. Instead of mere "air collectors," as many 
 suppose, may they not in reality be "soil collectors?" 
 A glance at the nature of the swamps in which they 
 grow naturally, will show their utility — shall we say 
 necessity? The soil of these swamps consist, for the 
 most part, of decayed trunks and branches, and the an- 
 nually falling leaves of the cypress itself. The swamps 
 themselves, are frequently several feet above the level 
 of the surrounding soil, so that it is the tree itself, as- 
 sisted, perhaps, by an impervious subsoil, that has to 
 form the conditions necessary for its growth. How use- 
 ful, then, are these knees in the process! Without 
 them, the winds would sweep through the trees, and 
 carry the leaves to the low ground outside ; while, as it
