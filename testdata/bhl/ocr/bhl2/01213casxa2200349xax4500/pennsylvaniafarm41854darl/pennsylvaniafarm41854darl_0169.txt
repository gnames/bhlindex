is, everything tliat falls is retained, not only to serve as 
 food, but to add weight to maintain the tree in its posi- 
 tion, which it would otherwise do with difficulty. In 
 drier ground, therefore, it has less need of these knees, 
 and they are generally smaller, and, in many cases, do 
 not appear at all. I think this explanation of the offi- 
 ces of cypress knees, is, at any rate, as probable as any 
 other, and will account for their appearance and disap- 
 pearance in some situations. 

Considerable attention has of late been deservedly 
 bestowed on the Pecan nut. I have always entertained 
 the idea that its barrenness in our locality arose from 
 its flowers being destroyed by late spring frosts. If 
 this prove to be certainly the case, attention will be re- 
 quired to produce a variety flowering later than usual, 
 .ind then propagated by grafting, as a correspondent 
 suggests. A specimen at Bartram's, 18 or 20 years 
 old, frequently perfects its fruit; while the old speci- 
 men very rarely does so. There is, also, a fine speci- 
 men, probably thirty years old, on the ground of Mr. 
 G. W. Holme, at Holmesburg, which Mi*. H. informed 
 me never fruited but once.

 The Strawberry Eeport. 
 Mr. Editor : — I was surprised to read in your last a 
 document purporting to be part of the proeeedings of 
 the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. Some one has 
 practised a fraud on you, and an injustice on me — noth- 
 ing of the kind having been adopted by the Society. 
 You will, probably, receive the correction through the 
 proper channel — the Secretary; and, pardon me for in- 
 terfering in the matter, though it so nearly concerns 
 myself. With regard to the matter itself, if our friends 
 will have it that it "is utterly impossible" for the sta- 
 mens of a strawberry blossom to become fully developed 
 by circumstances, in cases where they otherwise are 
 abortive, "■blighted," pistillate, to them let it so remain; 
 nobody contradicting. Had the advocates of this theory 
 confined themselves to the subject, I had long ago held 
 my peace; as, in the commencement, at my friend 
 Longworth's suggestion, I promised I would. But the 
 object of many of these articles seemed to be rather to 
 weaken public confidence in my knowledge, my honor, 
 or my capacity to cope with the questions I had under- 
 taken to elucidate, than to meet the subject itself. In 
 justice to my numerous friends, it became a duty to 
 show that I was perfectly capable of taking care of my- 
 self. This is all I have attempted to do, and though I 
 have said more than I intended or desired, I have not 
 said half what I might or ought to have said. Adver- 
 tisements, wagers, rewards, sham proceedings of socie- 
 ties, consultations, national prejudices, and so on, have 
 been invoked, and with what result ? A strawberry 3| 
 inches in circumference, in the month of January, hav- 
 ing NO NECK, is pronounced by some of the committee 
 to be the Gushing ! ! ! And, consequently, all that has 
 been said on the subject of sexual diflFerences, muat be 
 founded in error. Where is our friend with his tcm- 
 pora, more^ ? 

In concluding my share of this discussion, I have but 
 one more topic to notice. When Mr. Prince charged 

me with having composed my article to the Horticul- 
 turist with the aid of Dr. Darlington, you, in your own 
 knowledge, volunteered a denial in my behalf. In spite 
 of your statement, Mr. P. has since reiterated the 
 charge more strongly, and even advertised it. Let me 
 show how unworthy of credit such statements are. 

1st. That paper was written and forwarded before 
 the fifth of June. Mr. Barry can, if he like, confirm 
 this. 

Secondly. I had no communication with Dr. D. tiU I 
 saw him, in company with Mr. James, for a few mo- 
 ments, in the third week of June, when he merely allu- 
 ded to the Osage Orange fruit and Indian corn. Mr. 
 T. P. James can testify to this. 

Thirdly. I did not see Dr. D.'s article till the fourth 
 of July. Mr. Morris can confirm this, if needed. 

Fourthly. On reading it, while accidentally in West 
 Chester, I remarked to Dr. D. that my paper, sent to 
 Mr. Barry a month before, held similar views lo his 
 own. The editor of the Journal will bear me out in 
 this, also. 

Need I care about what these gentlemen (?) saj *'''r- 
 ther about me ?

 To Compute Interest. 

Mr. Editor: — I have frequently had occasion to eompiito 
 the interest on my sales or purchases, for a number of days, 
 and just as frequently have I found myseli botkei-ed .to cal- 
 culated the amount speedily and correctly. I remember 
 enough arithmetic from my schoolboy days, to calculate the 
 interest for a given number of years or months, without any 
 trouble, but the days rather cornered me. 

In a late Baltimore paper a correspondent gives the fol- 
 lowing plan for computing interest at 6 per cent, for any 
 number of days, which I would like to see preserved in the 
 pages of your valuable Journal. Some of your readers may 
 be as "slow" at calculating interest as I have been, and they 
 will find this plan a very convenient one. I have tested its 
 correctness thoroughly : 

Divide the number of days by six, and multiply the dol- 
 lars by the dividend, the result is the interest in decimals ; 
 cut oS" the right hand figure and you have it dollars or 
 cents — thus : — 

What is the interest on $100 for twenty-one days? 21 
 divided by six is SJ; 100 multiplied by 3J is .350, or 36 
 cent^. Again: What is the interest on $.378 for uinety-tbrec 
 days? 93 divided by 6 is 15 J; 378 multiplied by 15i is 
 5859, or $5,85 and 9-10. G. W. P.
