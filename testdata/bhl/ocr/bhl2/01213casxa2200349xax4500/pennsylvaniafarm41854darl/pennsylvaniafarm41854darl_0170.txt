PENNSYLVANIA FARM SCHOOL. 
 We annex below the act for the establishment of a 
 State Farm School, under the auspices of the State 
 Agricultural Society. We congratulate not only far- 
 mers, but citizens of all classes, on this happy consum- 
 mation, which will, if rightly managed, redound so 
 much to the substantial wealth and prosperity of our 
 good old Commonwealth. 

The establishment of the Farm School was looked 
 upon by many as one of the results certain to follow the 
 formation of the State Society, and to those who were 
 the pioneers in originating the latter and urging it for- 
 ward to its present prosperous footing in the face, too, 
 of much opposition, great credit is very justly due. As 
 a matter of history we quote the following from the 
 minutes of the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agri- 
 culture, in reference to this subject. Nov. 5, 1845, Dr. 
 Mease being President : 

"On motion of Dr. Elwyn, a committee of seven mem- 
 bers was appointed for the purpose of ascertaining the dis- 
 position of agriculturists in the different counties in this 
 State, on the subject of establishing a State Agricultu- 
 ral Society for the benefit and advancement of agricul- 
 ture throughout the State. Elwyn, Hulme, Potts, A. L. 
 Roberts, Gowen, Kenderton, Smith and Moore were ap- 
 pointed the Committee." 

"Nov. 1st, 1848. — On motion of Dr. Elwyn, a Com- 
 mittee of five was appointed for the purpose of confer- 
 ring with the Agricultural Society of Bucks county, and 
 also those of adjoining counties, with a view of giving 
 greater force and effect to the operations of the different 
 societies in their efforts to promote the cause of agricul- 
 tural improvement." 

"Jan. 3d, 1849. — The Committee appointed to confer 
 with the Bucks County Society, reported having met, 
 and agreed to appoint a Committee to confer with gen- 
 tlemen in other counties on the subject of a State Agri- 
 cultural Society, and to meet again Jan. 6th, 1849." 

At this postponed meeting very little appears to have 
 been done, and the subject rested till the 5th of Decem- 
 ber, 1849, when the President of the Society, Dr. El- 
 wyn, appointed a committee to take measures towards 
 the formation of a State Society as follows : Messrs. 
 Gowen, A. L. Roberts, J. P. Wetheral, J. C. Ford, 
 Robert Hare, to which Dr. Elwyn's name was afterwards 
 added. 

Feb. 6, 1850. — The above committee was continued, 
 and an address prepared by Dr. Elwyn to the farmers of 
 Pennsylvania was read by Mr. Freas, and placed in the 
 hands of the chairman, Mr. Gowen. 

"March 6. — Mr. Gowen read an address, which was 
 afterwards published." 

"In May, 1850. — Mr. A. L. Roberts moved that the
