and taught all things necessary to be known by a far- 
 mer, it being the design and intention of this law to es- 
 tablish an institution in which youth may be so educated 
 as to fit them for the occupation of a farmer. 

Sec. 7. That the board of trustees shall annually 
 elect a treasurer, who shall receive and disburse the funds 
 of the institution, and perform such other duties as shall 
 be required of him, and from whom they shall take such 
 security for the faithful performance of his duty as ne- 
 cessity shall require ; and it shall be the duty of the 
 said boaid of trustees annually, on or before the first of 
 December, to make out a full and detailed account of the 
 operations of the institution for the preceding year, and 
 an account of all its receipts and disbursements, and re- 
 port the same to the Pennsylvania State Agricultural

Sec. 8. That it shall be lawful for the Pennsylvania 
 State Agricultural Society to appropriate out of their

 funds, as will aid in the prosecution of this object ; and 
 it shall be the duty and privilege of the said society, at 
 such times as they shall deem expedient, by their com- 
 mittees, officers or otherwise, to visit the said institu-

WILLIAM BIGLER. 

The Pennsylvania Legislature and the Farmers' High 
 School. 
 J. L. Darlington — Dear Sir : — I do not think that 
 any thing practically useful could be established upon 
 the basis of the act "to incorporate the Farmers' High 
 School of Pennsylvania," as it has been passed by our 
 present Legislature. It is very manifest that in this day 
 of progress, speculation and enterprise, agricultural in- 
 terests are too slotv a subject to command Legislative at- 
 tention. Who could be found to spend time upon the 
 unprofitable subject of a school for farmers' sons, whilst 
 there is a forfeited railroad to be bargained for, a bank 
 to be incorporated, or a divorce to be obtained. Such 
 subjects are made very interesting. I most sincerely 
 wish that the farmers of Pennsylvania could be excited 
 to feel that their interests shall be cared for, that their 
 business is of more importance than all else besides, 
 and, especially, that their votes are more than a majori- 
 ty of all that are cast. In Pennsylvania to steal a dollar 
 from a mechanic or a merchant is indictable, and will be 
 punished as a crime, whilst a farmer's fences may be 
 broken down, carried away and burned, his orchard may 
 be robbed, and his field plundered of its corn, and there 
 is no law to prevent it. Our Legislature has been nu- 
 merously petitioned by farmers from all quarters of the 
 State, at this past session, to remedy this defect in our 
 laws, and lest it might be too much trouble and require 
 too much skill to mature a bill upon the subject, one was 
 prepared for them and put into their hands ; but it 
 lequired too much industry and perseverance to get it 
 rt.hrough. And now, in the vicinity of towns especially. 

the farmer's fences may be broken down, carrieil away 

and burned, his orchard may be robbed, his corn field 
 may be pillaged, and his remedy is an action of trespass 
 against a worthless thief. 

Farmers ask that a school may be incorporated and 
 based upon principles of teaching their art, and those 
 natural sciences which are necessarily connected with it; 
 they take the trouble to exhibit the plan by which such 
 a school may be made so much self sustaining as to 
 cheapen education within the reach of their means, and 
 ask the Legislature to aid them in their enterprise ; and 
 of the millions that are appropriated to other objects, it 
 is not even proposed to appropriate one farthing to so 
 important an object : the answer is an act of incorpora- 
 tion, which is stupid and senseless in every feature, hav- 
 ing a board of trustees of twenty-five or seventy-five, as 
 the case may be, so situate that they never can be got 
 together, and if convened once the same persons would 
 probably never be got together again. But what is to 
 be complained of is, that the farmers, as a class, are of 
 so little consideration in Pennsylvania they caimot com- 
 mand the respectful attention of their own Legislature. 
 Respectfully, FREDERICK WATTS. 

Carlisle, May, 1854. 

The above remarks of Judge Watts, as respects the gen- 
 eral legislation of our Commonwealth, are unfortunately 
 too true, and we fear there is little hope of amendation 
 until the producing interests, constituting nine-tenths of 
 the population, take the matter in hand and elect legis- 
 lators who sympathise with them in their efforts to sus- 
 tain the gejieral interests of the State, instead of those 
 whose only business at Harrisburg seems to be to serve 
 the interest of private corporations, local or foreign. 

In regard to the Act for the "Farmer's High School," 
 the Judge's "organ of hope" is evidently not so large as 
 ours. The defects of this act are too palpable to admit 
 of discussion, and the unmitigated meanness of the 
 Legislature in withholding an appropriation is — natural 
 enough, perhaps, under the circumstances, yet the ques- 
 tion presents itself, whether an imperfect act of incor- 
 poration at this time is not better than none at all ? 
 The preliminary steps towards an organization of the 
 school can be taken, which will be a work of much time 
 and consideration, and as the defects of the present act 
 become more apparent, we can live on hope that a future 
 Legislature will be blessed with sense enough to appre- 
 ciate the subject, and pass such amendments as will be 
 necessary to the successful completion of the enter- 
 prise.

The Apple Han in 1853. 

Mr. N. P. Mon-ison, of Somerville, last year .received 
 $10 for one barrel and twenty-eight apples of the Hub- 
 bardston variety. These apples were sold by the retail- 
 er at fifty to seventy-five cents a dozen. Mr. M. culti- 
 vates, says the New England Farmer, eight acres of 
 land ; his fruit, this barren year, 1853, brought him 

For twenty-six bushels of apples he received 
 For one hundred and thirty-six barrels he received 

For strawberries and raspberries $100. The 
 balance, to make up the whole sum, $850, was for cider 
 apples, sold at from eight to twelve cents a bushel, and
