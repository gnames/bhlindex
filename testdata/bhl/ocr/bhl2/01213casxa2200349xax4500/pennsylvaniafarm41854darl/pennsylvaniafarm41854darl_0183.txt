 some of our young men will come to the conclusion that 
 the market for good fruit is not yet over-stocked. Thei-e 
 is no rural pursuit which pays better than fruit culture 
 when properly attended to. 

A NEW TREE. 

The Boston Journal of Agriculture publishes a letter from 
 a respectable farmer in Olympia, Oregon, describing a re- 
 markable tree hitherto unknown. Wo annex the following 
 extract: — "A strange and beautiful tree has been discovered 
 in Washington Territory, which is not known to exist in 
 any other part of the habitable globe. The tree is des- 
 tined, I think, to make some noiso in the world. It is re- 
 markable, because its like is not found elsewhere, and on 
 uccount of its great beauty and fragrance. The tree varies 
 in height from one to »ei-cn feet. The leaf resembles Jhat of 
 the pear, while the trunk and branches look like those of an 
 orange tree. The upper side of the leaf is coated with gum, 
 having the appearance of oil, and of the consistence of 
 honey. Handling them causes the gum to adhere slightly 
 to the fingers. The gum, as well as the leaf and bark, is 
 highly odorous. The fragrance, which is quite strong, re- 
 sembles that of Bergamot, or ripe fruit, and a few leaves are 
 sufficient to perfume a room. A leaf, fully wrapped up in 
 paper, so as to be entirely concealed, was handed to several 
 persons, with a request that they would tell by the smell 
 what it was. All expressed themselves highly delighted 
 with its fragrance, but gave different answers as to its char- 
 acter. Some said it smelled like ripe pears; some that it 
 was Bergamot; whilst others thought it smelled like ripe 
 apples. The flower resembles that of the white Jessa- 
 mine, 

'•This will certainly make a very beautiful and desirable 
 ornamental tree, to grow in our gardens, around our dwell- 
 ings, near the parlor windcws, or to form a choice bower. 
 Its intrinsic value for these purposes is greatly enhanced by 
 the consideration that it is Evergreen. This specimen is 
 brought from my farm, and is taken from a grove of about 
 a quarter of an acre. The plant is very rare even here, the 
 oldest settlers of the country say they never saw it growing 
 elsewhere," 

Uannre for Fears and Some New Varieties. 

Mr. Rivers, the well known English nurseryman, has 
 lately issued a new catalogue, in which he remarks that the 
 following compound has been of great service in growing 
 pours, whether they were on the pear or quince stock. A 
 bhickish rich earth is frequently found in low marshy spots, 
 and along the banks of creeks ; this is generally considered 
 rich, and valuable for horticultural purposes. In its fresh 
 state such is not the case, but Mr. Rivers has found that 
 if it is dug out and laid in a ridge, mixing it with one- 
 eighth part of unslacked lime, and turning it two or three 
 times for about eight weeks before it is applied, it makes a 
 very valuable manure for pear trees, especially when they 
 are newly transplanted; one wheelbarrow full to a tree being 
 considered sufficient. Mr. Rivers likewise remarks that the 
 only method of growing pears successfully in a pyramidal 
 form, on pear stocks, is by biennial transplantation. This is 
 a process which will not be adopted here for some time, if 
 ever, as it is hardly suited to the climate, or to our different 
 modes of cultivation. 

Concerning this biennial removal of trees, the same writer 
 Says, it is "the most simple of all methods of root pruning; 
 it consists in digging a trench round the tree early in Novem- 
 ber, and lifting it out of the ground carefully, with all the 
 earth possible attached to the roots, shortening with the knife 

any that are straggling." The method applies only to the 
 dwarf pyrimidal pear trees, which experience is now show- 
 ing to be the most successful, and most economical method of 
 growing fine fruit, and which is growing more in favor every 
 day with fruit growers. 

The following are the remarks of Mr. Rivers on some new 
 pears which have been introduced the last season : 

Alexandre Brivort. — First quality, second in size, flavor 
 sugary, perfumed and exquisite. It literally melts in the 
 mouth. January. 

Belle de Noel. — First quality, second size, grows slowly. 
 Is an excellent Christmas pear, melting and rich. 

Bcxtrre Giffnrt. — First quality, second size. New, hardy, 
 and one of the best early pears; succeeds as a bush on the 
 quince better than as a pyramid. Melting and very juicy, 
 with a noj-au flavor. August, 

Ducheusc dc Mars. — First quality, third in size. No pear 
 can be more high flavored and delicious. Succeeds on the 
 quince, but requires to be double worked. December to 
 January. 

Mareckal de Cour. — First in quality, first in size. A new 
 and fine pear, which Van Mens said he considered was the 
 best he ever raised. Forms a good pyramid on the quince. 
 November. 

Onondaga or Swan's Orange. — First in quality, first in 
 size. Mr. Rivers says of this new American pear, that ho 
 has found it hardier than even William's Bon Cretien. Oc- 
 tober. 

Smette de Bavay. — First in quality, and third in size. A 
 new excellent late and hardy pear; in a warm season melt- 
 ing; otherwise half melting, but always good. iSucceeds 
 well on the quince, and proves naturally a handsome and 
 prolific pyramid. March to May. — Michigan Fanner.

Chinese Primulas. 

We copy for the benefit of our flower loving readers (and 
 who of them are not) the following article from the English 
 Gardeners' Chronicle: — "As nothing in their way could pos- 
 sibly be finer than my specimens of these at the present 
 time, I have thought that some account of my mode of cul- 
 tivating them might be useful. The single white and pink 
 varieties ripen seeds in abundance, which afford a ready 
 means of increasing them ; and as the fringed sorts are the 
 most beautiful, seeds of them should be preferred. The dou- 
 ble varieties are multiplied from cuttings. The best plants 
 are raised from seeds sown every year; they should never 
 be kept beyond the second season. Two sowings, one this 
 month and the other in May, will supply the greenhouse 
 with flowering plants from October till May, and even later. 
 The produce of the first sowing must be prevented from 
 flowering till the end of September, by nipping off the flow- 
 er buds as they appear. They should then (September) be 
 well established in their pots, and they will require no care 
 beyond ordinary attention, and keeping them from frost, to 
 flower them well. The second sowing, the produce of which 
 is intended to keep up gaiety in spring, should receive the 
 final shift in September, and every blossom, as it appears, 
 should be picked off till the beginning of January. I have 
 said nothing about watering and shifting, but these opera- 
 tions must, of course, be attended to. The plants should bo 
 placed a little deeper in the pots at every shift; care must 
 taken to keep them from damping off in winter. As a pre- 
 ventive of this feeders under the pots are recommended to be 
 used, for the plants are very impatient of water administer- 
 ed to the soil. These feeders should bo liberally supplied 
 with water when the plants are in bloom. The Chinese 
 Primrose, like the rest of its race, delights in soil composed 
 of leaf-mould, loam, peat, sand, and a little charcoal. The
