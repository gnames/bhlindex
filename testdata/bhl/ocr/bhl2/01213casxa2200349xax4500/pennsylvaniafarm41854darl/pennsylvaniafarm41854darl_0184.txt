above is a mode by which these may be grown successfully 
 in pots; but they may bo cuUivatod with equal facility, and 
 better chances of success, planted out in summer in pits. 
 As in the former mode of culture, sow at the same time, and 
 forward the plants in pots in the groonhouse till the end of 
 May, when they should bo turned out of their pots, and 
 planted in prepared compost in a frame under a north wall. 
 Keep them close for a few days after planting, then remove 
 nil covering, and leave them freely exposed to the weather, 
 till the time comes for lifting them and potting them, which 
 should bo about the middle of September. After they are 
 potted, replace them in the same frame, and shade them for 
 a day or two, to keep them from flagging. In about a fort- 
 night, remove them to the greenhouse, where they will bloom 
 well throughout autumn. Seeds for specimens for spring- 
 work should be sown about the middle of April, and treated 
 as the autumn flowers, taking care to keep them free from 
 frost and from damping oS' in winter. After they have done 
 blooming, they may be planted out as before, and will flower 
 well next autumn. I have seen plants not excited by fire- 
 heat, or allowed to flower in the previous winter or spring, 
 blossom well in the flower garden during summer; and, not 
 over-luxuriant, but strong old plants, put out in a west as- 
 pect in September, on an elevated dry border, under the 
 shade of neighboring Laurel boughs, have been known to 
 survive the winter near London, and to put forth flowers 
 with the Crocus, Polyanthus, and other fair harbingers of 
 summer. They did not suffer so much from frost as from 
 the cold winds of March, "while winter still lingers on the 
 verge of spring." — B. 

Sweet Scented Vernal Grass. 

We have been furnished by Dr. Emerson with a copy 
 of the following cemmunication, addressed by him to the 
 Editors of the Boston Cultivator, where it was published 
 in the number for the 22d of April. It relates to a sub- 
 ject particularly interesting to those living in the vicini- 
 ty of Philadelphia, where opportunities exist for testing 
 the accuracy of the author's observations, and the pre- 
 sent time is the very best in all the year for doing so. 
 Reference is made to communications upon the subject 
 published elsewhere, but those who possess the Farmei-'s 
 Encycloptcdia — and no intelligent fai-mer should be 
 without a copy of this excellent woi-k for constant refer- 
 ence upon practical mattera connected with agriculture 
 — may find in it a good deal of information relative to 
 the grass in question under the heads of Anthoxanthum 
 odorattim and grasses : 

Messrs. Editors : — One of the late numbers of tho Bos- 
 ton Cultivator contains a paragraph which runs as follows : 
 "Several papers are recommending the sweet-scented var- 
 nal grass {Anthoxanthum Odoratum,) as a good pasture 
 grass for cows. We hope no one will be induced to try it, 
 as there are many better kinds. It is a mistake that the ex- 
 cellence of the Philadelphia butter is owing to this gi-ass. 
 The idea never eould have proceeded from an observing far- 
 mer. Cows are not fond of it, and only eat it when better 
 cannot be had. The .Tune grass, (poa pratensi's,) abounds 
 in many pastures around Philadelphia. It is one of tho 
 sweetest and most nutritive gra-sses, and is well known to be 
 one of the best for feeding dairy and fattening cattle." 

These summary conclusions I regard as hastily drawn, 
 and trust they will not generally be received without further 
 examination of the subject, which is one, I conceive, not a 
 little interesting to those especially devoted to agriculture, 
 but also to tho community at large, everybody being more 
 or less concerned in the improvement of dairy products. 

Laying claim, as I do, to be the first who pointed out the 
 sweet-scented vernal grass as furnishing the proximate 
 cause of that delightful flavor for which tho butter in tho 
 Philadelphia and many European markets is distinguished. 
 I do not feel content to remain silent under the taunt thrown 
 out against my capacities for observation. My opinions 
 upon the subject were not made up in a flash, but tho results 
 of years of close inquiry, examination of pasturo-fields and 
 meadows where the cows fed, which produced the highest- 
 flavored butter brought to our market, and finally to chemi- 
 cal analysis, and crucial experimeuts, as I regard them, 
 made under my direction by many^ persons in many places. 
 The late Mr. Skinner, whose agricultural writings and pub- 
 cations have done so much good in extending useful infor- 
 mation throughout our country, asked me several years ago 
 what it was that made Philadelphia spring butter so much 
 better than any other he found elsewhere in his extensive 
 travels in the United States? Excellent butter he had met with 
 in several places, but none that possessed the exquisite flavor 
 of Philadelphia butter. Having spent some time in the in- 
 vestigation of the subject, I communicated to him my views, 
 and these may be found by any one who will take the trou- 
 ble to refer to the Farmer's Library, for April, 1845, or the 
 Patent Ofiice Reportfor 1849-50. After several years addition- 
 al attention and observation, since my first publication, I find 
 no reason to change any of the opinions formerly expressed. 
 These have been extensively published in newspapers and 
 agricultural periodicals, but, so far as I know, have never 
 been assailed or treated so ungraciously as in the paragraph 
 quoted from the Boston Cultivator. The person who fur- 
 nished tho article assumes to know something about the 
 grasses in the pastures of this vicinity, and speaks of the 
 "June grass," (poa prate/tsts,) as abounding in them. This 
 he describes as one of the sweetest and most nutritive of 
 grasses, and would seem to infer that it may possibly furnish 
 the proximate principle which confers on Philad butter its pe- 
 culiarly fine flavor. Not having myself ever heard of a grass 
 in this locality designated as the "June grass," I have asked 
 others whose residence in the country ought to have made 
 them acquainted with a grass described as abounding. But 
 no one appears to know anything of June graw. Poa pra- 
 tensis, or common green grass, that which constitutes the 
 almost universal herbage of every other portion of our coun- 
 try, exists around Philadelphia, though here its quantity ia 
 limited by its rival in the sward. Like all the poa family, 
 the common green grass, or poa pratensis, is destitute of 
 any fragrant or aromatic principle, though it certainly gives 
 out a grateful odor when newly mown. The sweet-scented 
 vernal grass, however, possesses a distinct aromatic princi- 
 ple, which can be readily distilled from it, and the basis of 
 which is the well known benzoic acid, familiarly known to 
 apothecaries as the Flowers of Benzoin. AVithin a circle of 
 many miles diameter around Philadelphia, every field left 
 out of culture a few years, becomes coated with its sweet 
 verdure — the soil being filled with latent seed. The longer 
 the meadows or upland pastures are left unbroken by tho 
 plough, the greater the predominance of this fragrant herb- 
 age. It is precisely these old pasture grounds, of twenty or 
 thirry j-ears standing, that furnish the highest flavored but- 
 ter, and that, in the latter part of May, when the grass is in 
 bloom, fills the surrounding country with a rich, vanillaJike 
 fragrance, 

In the communications published by me relative to this 
 grass, I have expressly stated that it was not to be regarded 
 as a first-rate hay grass, or cultivated separately as such. 
 But as a pasture grass, I deem it valuable for many reasons, 
 among which are the following. 1. It furnishes the first 
 spring bite, so grateful to tho stock of all kinds. Cows are
