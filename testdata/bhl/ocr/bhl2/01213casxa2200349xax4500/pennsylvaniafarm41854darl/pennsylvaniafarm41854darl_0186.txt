Was not known as a gaseous substance previous to the 17th 
 century. 

Tl;e etrervescense of the mild alkalies with acids was, as 
 already noticed, known much earlier; and that a peculiar 
 air was emitted from some holes in the earth, was noticed 
 by Pliny; and others noticed, at earlier periods, that some 
 mineral waters wore strongly impregnated with a peculiar 
 air. In the beginning of the 18th century, several attempts 
 were made to describe a peculiar ajriform body, but nothing 
 definite was reached before the time of Black, (1757); and 
 from this time to that of Lavoiser's investigations, there 
 were but vague ideas of its real character entertained by 
 those who considered the subject. It had various names. 
 Macbride found, (1764,) that it was formed by the decompo- 
 sition of organic substances. He found that blood, when 
 first drawn from the veins, contained it. Cavendish found, 
 (1767,) that a stream of this fixed air, passed into lime 
 water, would throw down all the lime, out of the solution; 
 and that by a still greater quantity of the gas, the lime at 
 first thrown down would dissolve again ; and thus explained 
 how lime stone could be dissolved in water holding fixed 
 air; also why, by boiling the solution holding the limestone, 
 the latter was separated as grounds in the kettle. Lane 
 showed, (1769,) that water containing fixed air was a sol- 
 vent of iron and v.inc. Bergman, (1774.) gave a history of 
 fixed air, and called it air acid, (aciditm cei-eiim.) He first 
 introduced the idea that it was an acid ; and further — that 
 it existed in the atmosphere. Keir, (1777,) named it lime 
 gas. Bucquet, (1773,) called it chalk gas. Morveau, 
 (1782) called it nephitique acide—ioaX acid — and its combi- 
 nations he called mephites, as the mephite of lime, mephite 
 of magnesia — carbonate of lime and magnesia. It was of- 
 ten confounded with another gaseous substance, about which 
 nothing was definitely known, viz : nitrogen. 

Finally, in 1781, Lavoiser in a memoir before the Paris 
 academy, gave its constitution, and named it acide carboni- 
 quc, or carbonic acid. 

In 1771, '72, '73 and '74, the subject of the discovery of 
 the element oxygon, was, for the first time, before the scien- 
 tific world, and to the consideration of it lead Lavoiser to 
 a more careful examination of carbonic acid, and, in the 
 memoir already noticed, he considered the fixed air a com- 
 pound of oxygen and ordinary coal, or carbon. In 1783 he 
 published an analysis of it, giving the amount of carbon 
 and oxygen it contained. (The analysis was far from cor- 
 rect, but it was the first of a series that finally established 
 the amount of each.) 

To follow out the history in detail, would lead us entirely 
 away from the subject of lime. We have traced limestone 
 till we find its investigators examining its carbonic acid, and 
 now we have arrived at the period at which this is found to 
 be a compound body, and the history of its oxygen and car- 
 bon present separate themes, which, perchance, the farmer, 
 for whom we have endeavored to write, might deem tedious. 

To return. Carbonic acid was known only as a gas from 
 the time of Black, (1755,) up to that of the world-renowned 
 English philosopher, Dr. Farady, of the present day. In 
 1823, this man, by an ingenious contrivance, submitted the 
 gas to an enormous pressure, and found that at 32 degrees, 
 with a pressure of 640 lbs. to the square inch, it became a 
 transparent, mobile fluid; and in 1835, Thilorier succeeded 
 in solidifying it when it had the appearance of silky asbes- 
 tos. By the evaporation of this body, the most intense de- 
 gree of cold known is produced, being about 175 degrees 
 below zero. 

To attempt to enumerate the combinations with other bo- 
 dies of this acid and its elements — about which nothing was 
 known one hundred years ago— that are now definitely 

known to chemists, would require a small volume of names, 
 wl'.ich, for the present, may be omitted, while we proceed to 
 follow up tic subject of lime. From the discovery of Black 
 up to the beginning of the present century, caustic lime was 
 considered as a simple, elementary body, but by the investi- 
 gation of Sir Humphry Davy, at this period, it was proved 
 to be a compound of oxygen, and a raetalic substance — cal- 
 cium. And thus our knowledge stands at the present time : 
 that carbonate of lime, or limestone, consists of caustic limo 
 and carbonic acid — making pure limestone. The first con- 
 sisting of calcium and oxygen, the last of carbon and oxy- 
 gen. • 

Mineralogists distinguish two difi'erent kinds of pure lime- 
 stone, dependant upon dilference of chrystaline form. They 
 are calcite or calcarious spar, in Rhombohedal form, and 
 Arragonite, of prismetic (Primitive) form. This difierence 
 was noted by Werner, in 1788, and later, Hauy, a great min- 
 eralogist, showed that the two forms were totally difi'erent, 
 indicating, as was then thought, a difference of composition. 
 In the same year, Klaproth showed that the composition of 
 arragonite was identical with that of calcite. Kirvin, 1794, 
 suggested that the diS"erence in form was owing to the pre- 
 sence of strontium in arragonite, but Vauquelin, 1803, Buc- 
 holz, 1804, Thenard, 1806, Biost, 1807, and Stromeyer, 1813. 
 all sought in vain to find the strontium; but it remained for 
 G. Rose, in 1839, to show that the different forms assumed 
 by the chrystals, was owing to the difiereut temperatures at 
 which they were ehrystalized. 

We shall draw this subject to a close in the next article, 
 with a few remarks upon some other compounds of lime and 
 their relations to agriculture, after which it is to be hoped 
 the winter will be over, and wo can consider some subjects 
 more closely connected with this part of the agricultural 
 world. The winter set in cold, but about the 1st of January 
 it moderated, and was very warm and pleasant nearly all 
 the month. Now it is a little colder, and we have some 
 snow. Yours, Ac, E. P.

TEEES. 

One of the most important and necessarj' oflBces (duties) 
 of a farmer's paper is to expose and correct the many gross 
 errors, which gain prevalence in regard to various depart- 
 ments of culture ; for some of these errors occasion sad 
 waste of money, time, care and enjoyment, and being often 
 tenaciously held to, even experience itself can seldom reach 
 or lift the veil that hides the truth. Thus, it is said to be 
 impossible to persuade the inhabitants of some of the West 
 India Islands to feed oats to horses — they are too well as- 
 sured that they are unwholesome, if not poisonous! 

One wrong and mischief woi-king opinion held by a ma- 
 jority of persons who plant trees for the first time, is : That 
 having been accustomed to admire trees in the woods, which 
 have grown up in each other's shade, with long clean stems, 
 handsome and well adapted for making rails or boards, 
 therefore a nursery fruit tree, to be handsome, must have a 
 similar form, as if its stem, too, is to be used, forgetful of 
 this essential difference between the two, that on the timber 
 tree the fewer brunchen the better, but on the fruit tree the 
 branches are the valuable and jiroductire part, and the stem 
 is only serviceable as a pillar, firm enough to support the 
 branches, and as a collection of sap-pipes competent to carry 
 up sap enough to supply every branch, leaf and fruit through 
 the driest weather. 

The planter, with rail timber in his eye, does not like a 
 fruit tree with a strong, rugged, tapering stem, especially if 
 it is scarred with the marks of branchlets which have been 
 loft on to increase its size and strength, and afterwards re-
