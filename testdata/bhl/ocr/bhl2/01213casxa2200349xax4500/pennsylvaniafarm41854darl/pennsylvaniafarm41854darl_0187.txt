moved ; or if it set with "?purs," the rather rough looking 
 marks of fruitfnincss ; but he is delighted with trees that, 
 by growing elosolv in a nursery and early disbudding, have 
 run up in each other's shade just as slim and clean as plants 
 in dense woods. There may be some "spinal curvature," — a 
 drooping of the head, but it can be straightened — the trees 
 are just the thing, and when set out look quite imposing. 
 Such trees never protper in the orchard. The delicate nar- 
 row-cheated dandy might aa well be exposed to the hard- 
 ships oi" backwoods' life, and expected to "subdue the wild" 
 as that the slender, few piped, thin barked, high stemmed 
 tree should bo expected to withstand the storms, or make the 
 wide luxuriant top that alone can bear a crop of fine fruit. 
 Any experienced orchardist or nurseryman will witness that 
 the only way to make anything of such trees is to cut their 
 useless stems down to the ground, then, provided the roots 
 are good, and the tree has room and proper culture, it may 
 bo of some v.alue in course of time. But as a general thing, 
 such trees are worth about as much for planting as the tops 
 of the White mounUiins are for farming. 

Another common opinion is that lanje trees are better for 
 planting than small ones. [It is hard to guess what a wri- 
 ter means by vaguely saying "a large tree." A largo plum 
 tree would be but a small apple tree, and a large dwarf pear 
 would be but small as a cherry: and a large apple tree of 
 .such sorts as the Summer Rose, Early Joe, Pearmain, or 
 Newtown Pippin, would be quite a small Rhode Island 
 Greening, Baldwin or Fallenwalder.] A farmer once re- 
 marked to me that he was convinced of the advantages of 
 planting large trees, for what were largest when he planted 
 eight or ten years before were largest yet, and he pointed to 
 some trees of Pennock apple, Summer bon Cretien pear, and 
 market plums as examples. But these sorts will outgrow 
 others anywhere, and will extend further in one year than 
 many sorts far superior to them will in three or four. In the 
 case just referred to tlie amount and quality of fruit were in 
 favor of other trees. 

The advantages and disadvantages of planting large trees 
 are practically about as follows : 

The nurseryman knows that in setting out smoll plants he 
 is certain of complete success with usu.al care. If he plants 
 larger stalks he must take proportionably greater and greater 
 pains, until he reaches a degree of size (usually that of a 
 plant which has borne one or two crops of fruit,) beyond 
 which the operation is uncertain, and in many cases hope- 
 less of life, and much more of fruitfulness. 

Repeated transplantations in the nurser}', with a pruning 
 liaek of the roots eafch time, greatly relieves the ha^.ard at- 
 tending the removal of large trees; but this must be skil- 
 fully and carefully done, with much pains to avoid causing 
 too great a check in the growth during any one season, or 
 the sap-pipes will become choked or their nice valves decay- 
 ed. Of course the trouble and time involved will be great 
 compared with the original value of the tree, and its life 
 must be inevitably abridged to some extent: but the fruit- 
 fulness of very strong growing sorts will be increased, and 
 their real value enhanced by this course. In the final plant- 
 ing out of such trees they should be under the eye of a skil- 
 ful gardener or amateur, who will care for them as a mother 
 for a child, especially during the drouths of August, 

AVe caflnot expect every man who plants an orchard, and 
 who has also "other fish to fry," to be able to give the close 
 and intelligent attention of the amateur. Such planters will 
 do best to select trees five to seven feet high, well branched, 
 with stiff, firm stems, showing a healthy, ripe, moderatelj' 
 vigorous growth, and, if early fruiting is desired, many 
 short spurs. Such trees, properly planted and duly cultiva- 
 ted and protected, are sure to give satisfaction, and will 

yield fruit soon and perfect of its kind, and continue fruit- 
 ful till a future generation shall rise and bless the hand that 
 planted them. 

Mr. Elder says in your April number that nurserymen 
 advise the planting of small trees when they know that largo 
 trees are best. If nurserj'men deserve any imputation of the 
 kind I should think they would be rather chargeable with 
 unjustifiable efforts to get their large trees off their hands, 
 for it is obviousl}' their interest to dispose of such first, be- 
 fore they become too large or inconvenient for safe remo- 
 val. 

"Doctors disagree" on man}' points. Mr. Meehan, who 
 is, like Mr. Elder, a head gardener, advises particularly, in 
 his late work on trees, that the following* among others 
 should be set out at an early age ; as of the beech he says, 
 "for permanent situations a two year old plant is better than 
 an older one ;" and such advice is universally given by the 
 best authorities. . WM. G. WARING.

Wheat and Cheat and Wheat and Oats. 

Mr. Editor: — The following fact, th(nigh rather old, was 
 called to mind by reading in the April number of your Jour- 
 nal, an article headed "Wheat vs. Cheat Again." If you 
 think it worthy of notice it is at ycur disposal : 

In the summer of 'S6, while cutting wheat on the Spring 
 Mount farm, in Lyken's valley, Dauphin county, Pa., in a 
 field where oats and spring wheat grew side by side, I found 
 in a growing state a head of wheat with four large plump 
 grains of oats growing together out of the side of the wheat 
 head. I was but a boy then, and did not know where to de- 
 posit the curiosity for the benefit of science, (we had nottho 
 Farm Journal at that time,) so I cut it off carefully, dried 
 it and put it into a bottle, where I preserved it for several 
 years, showing it to a number of persons, until at last the 
 oats fell from the head, and the whole was cast away as no 
 longer a curiosity. 

Mr. Gundy may perhaps suspect this also of being a 
 fraud. If so it was not called forth by any $100 reward ; 
 but, unprovoked and unlocked for, was gratuitously com- 
 mitted by D.ame Nature herself. Having, as I stated above, 
 found the head in a growing state and cut it myself from the 
 parent stalk, I am willing at any time to be qualified that it 
 was the work of nature. 

I do not mention this circumstance to frighten my fellow 
 .agriculturists into the idea that their icheat will all turn into 
 octtn. It was certainly a strange freak of n.ature, and one in 
 which I presume she does not often indulge. I give it for 
 the purpose of showing that should Prof. Mupes, or Prof, 
 any body else, ever succeed in producing cheat and wheat 
 upon the same stalk, it could hardly be considered as proof 
 positive that wheat turns to cheat, or cheat to wheat. 

My motto is clean seed upon clean soil, and a clean har- 
 vest may bo looked for. Firm in this belief I have sowed 
 in my garden a small patch of wheat, v/hich one of my 
 neighbors, a transmutationist, has undertaken to turn into 
 cheat, for which service he is to receive my whole farm and 
 stock when the job is completed. Would not some of jour 
 subscribers add one or two more farms to his reward. They 
 will be dearly earned. Yours respectfully,

 health, his family and his farm, and subscribes for the 
 Farm Journal, is sure to prosper. S.
