HORTICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS. 

We continue from last number ii jseries of cuts repre- 
 senting the most approved horticultural implements in 
 \;sc. They are generally made light and strong, of the 
 best materials, and will enable any one having occasion 
 to use them to do more work in a given time, and with 
 less fatigue, than with the old, heavy, clumsy contrap- 
 tions fast going out of use. 

FIG. 1. FIG. 2. 

Fig. 1 is a Fruit Gatherer, intended for gathering 
 fruits from branches which cannot easily be reached by 
 other means, and would be injured by falling to the 
 ground. It consists of a canvas bag suspended below a 
 forked iron, to which is attached a long handle. The 
 iron fork is placed across the stem of the fruit, when by 
 a slight pull it is toi'n from the limb, and deposited in 
 the canva.s bag. 

Fig. 2 is used for cutting grass in yards, &c. Any 
 one residing in towns or villages where scythes are not 
 at hand, will find them almost indispensable ; and even 
 at farm houses, the cai-eful matron after once viewing 
 the damage done by the scythe to her flowers and shrub- 
 bery, to say nothing of the uneven manner her grass has 
 been trimmed, would do well to request her mate to pro- 
 cui-e a grass hook for future use. 

FIG. 3. 

Fig. 3, Sliding Pruning Shears. — These differ from the 
 last in having a movable motion for one of the blades, by 
 which a draw or sliding cut, instead of a crushing cut, 
 is made, leaving the section of the part attached to the 
 tree smooth. 

FIG, 4. FIG. 5. 

Fig. 4 is strongly made, with long wood handles, and 
 is used for cutting large branches from trees, shrubbery, 
 &c. 

Fig. 5, The Vine Scissors, are uaed for thinning out 
 grapes, when they have set too close in the bunch ; also 
 for removing superfluous leaves, twigs, &c.
