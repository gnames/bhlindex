THE FARM JOURKAL. 

[JUKB 

A good V volving horde rake will render Imnd rakes en- 
 tii-ely unnecessary, and save time and labor. Should 
 wages continue as high as at present, tliose who have 
 much grass to cut will find it to their interest to procure 
 mowing machines. 

Fruit Ouchard. — This month and beginning of next 
 is the tune for regulating the heads of fruit trees, by 
 pinching off the terminal bud, or shortening-in process. 
 The shape of trees is thus under perfect control. Thin 
 out the fruit where too abundant. Mulch the surface of 
 ground under trees to keep it damp. Give attention to 
 caterpillars. Save your plums from the curculio, by 
 striking the tree suddenly with heavy blows with a mal- 
 let (taking care not to bruise the bark), every morning, 
 and catch tliem beneath in sheets spread for the purpose. 
 Try "the little Turk," with the coating of white wash, 
 appled to the fruit through a syringe, or dusting the tree 
 with air slacked lime. One of our friends near West 
 Chester has succeeded well for two or three seasons with 
 these remedies. Such fine fruit is well worthy the trou- 
 ble of repeating the application for a few times. The 
 peacli borer also requires close attention this month, and 
 cutting into his hiding place in the bark just below the 
 surface df the ground. Thin out gooseberries and cur- 
 rants, wliere the bushes are too much loaded, and cover 
 the ground with salted hay to prevent mildew. Prune 
 grape vines where needed. The productiveness of 
 strawberry beds may be increased by an occasional wat- 
 ering between the rows if the weather should be dry. 
 Wash the bark of trees if not already done. If of slug- 
 gish growth, dig in well rotted manure, or guano. If 
 any symptoms of blight appear in pear trees, use the 
 knife immediately, and cut off below the part affect- 
 ed. 

Vegetable Garden. — Alost of the earlj' crops of let- 
 tuce, radishes, spinach, &c., being now past, the ground 
 should be cleared and pi-epared for late beets and car- 
 rots. Take advantage of moist days for planting out 
 succession crops of cabages. These may occupy ground 
 in the paths of onion beds. Water cauliflowers in dry 
 weather, and draw up earth to stems. Such as are ad- 
 vanced in flower should have the leaves bent down over 
 tliem to protect them from the sun and rain. Thin out 
 beets, carrots and parsnips. Stir frequently and deeply 
 with the hoe, and keep down all weeds. Kidney beans 
 may be planted, and beet seed. Re-sow such seeds of 
 brocoli, cauliflower and cabbage as have missed. Celery 
 plants that have arrived at sufficient size should be 
 planted out for early crop. Dig a trench spade deep, 
 laying the earth equally on each side, and fill in bottom 
 about three inches deep of well rotted manure, incorpo- 
 rating it well with the soil. Cut off the tops of plants, 
 and also ends of roots, before setting out, and then plant 
 six inches apart. Water well as soon as planted, and 
 shade with boards laid on sticks across the trench till 
 growth is established. Earth up in a dry time as the 
 plants continue growing, and avoid covering the heart, 
 repeating it every two weeks till sufficiently blanched. 
 Cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, squashes, okra, peas and 
 corn may still be planted. Set out sweet potatoe sprouts 
 in rows, four feet apart, in rich light soil, and keep clear 
 of weeds till vines cover the ground. A small quantity 
 of turnip seed should be sown this month for early au- 

tumn use. Plant out the balance of tomato, egg plants 
 and pepper, also pot and other herbs from seed bed. 
 Herbs for drying should be gathered as they are begin- 
 ning to come into flov/er, and laid in the shade so as to 
 dry gradually. 

Flower Garden. — Continue the directions given last 
 month. JIow grass plots and follow with the roller. 
 Secure the young shoots of roses and floweiing plants to 
 stakes or main branches, to prevent being broken with 
 the wind. Tliis gives them a good shape, and they will 
 flower better for it. Hoe and rake flower beds and 
 walks frequently. It adds much to the appearance of a 
 flower garden. Transplant annuals in damp weather, 
 and sow again for late blooming. Gi-eenhouse plants 
 generally may be planted out this month. Continue to 
 plant dahlias. Drive a strong stake down firmly beside 
 each one, and secure it safely to prevent being broken 
 with the wind. Tuberoses and gladiolus may still be 
 planted. Tulips and hyacinths are improved by being 
 lifted once in two or three years, and replanted in fresh 
 soil, or the old one enriched, observing after lifting to 
 stow away in a dry airy place, and plant again in the 
 fall. Bulbs should be lilted when the tops have decay-

AGRICULTURAL GLEANINGS. 

[A friend of ours — an intelligent and successful far- 
 mer — has been in the habit, during the last thirty years, 
 of jotting down in his note book every f;ict that he came 
 across, whether by reading, conversation or otherAviae, 
 that appeared to him as likely to be useful at some fu- 
 ture time, either as a matter of reference, experiment or 
 comparison, in the practical operations of his farm. 
 The habit is a good one, and well worthy of imitation 
 by every farmer. We select from our friend's note book, 
 which he has kindly lent us for the purpose, a few of 
 his gleanings, and will continue them in future numbers 
 of the Journal:] 

Select the largest and flattest onions and the largest 
 potatoes for seed, or the crop will degenerate. 

Seeds when not sufficiently ripe will swim, when ripe 
 will fall to the bottom — a fact said to hold good with all 
 seeds. 

Vermin on cattle .are effectually destroyed by a mix- 
 ture of Scotch snuff and train oil, rubbed along the back 
 and neck. 

Horse Medicine. — To give them a good coat, take 
 swelling from their legs and put them in good condition. 
 One lb. of nitre, ^ lb. of flour brimstone mixed with 
 molasses, and made in balls the size of a hen egg, one 
 given each day till all is taken. This is said to be the 
 best medicine (for what it is intended) that ever was 
 given to a horse. 

Bruises and Sprains. — Dissolve one oz. of camphor 
 in 8 oz. spirits of wine, then add 1 oz. oil of turpentine, 
 1 oz. spirit of sal ammoniac, ^ oz. oil of origanum, one 
 table spoonful of laudanum, well rubbed in a quarter of 
 an hour each time, 4 times a day. The effect is very 
 great. 

Gate Posts. — That part which goes in the ground 
 should be charred or prepared by tar or pitch. Posts 
 will last longer if their natural position be reversed, 
 that is, the top end of the wood put in the ground. The
