and sow at the rate of three to three and a half bushels 
 to the acre. A couple of men can go over in this way 
 six or seven acres per day. The covei ing may be done 
 with a harrow run lengthwise of the row. We will 
 speak of curing it hereafter. In a dry season and short 
 pasture, green fodder is a most excellent substitute for 
 grass, and some of it should be sown for this purpose, 
 independent of a supply for winter feeding. We have 
 known milch cows to increase greatly in their milk when 
 fed with it as a change from even the best pasture. We 
 see asserted in some of the papers that cows in calf re- 
 quire rest, and should not be milked too near the time of 
 calving for fear of injuring the foetus. The phosphates 
 in the milk should be reserved to form bone in the calf. 
 This is all nonsense. In our dairy if a cow don't milk 
 up to within a month of calving with proper food, such 
 as corn fodder and roots, she goes to the butcher, unless 
 possessed of some venj eztraordinanj countei'balaucing 
 properties. 

2d — Root Crops. — AVe have no idea roots will ever be 
 in this country an entire substitute for Indian corn, or 
 that they can supersede the latter for fattening animals. 
 To claim too much for any new method often retards its 
 introduction more than to claim too little. AVhat we 
 claim for roots is that they are an invaluable adjunct for 
 winter feeding, milk to a much later period than they 
 otherwise would go, improve the quality of buttei', and 
 promote the health and thrift of stock cattle, cows, 
 horses and sheep. Like corn fodder a crop of roots is 
 not exhausting to the soil, and when well cultivated 
 leaves it in fine condition. 

The first of June is a good time for sowing sugar 
 beets or mangel wurzel, and the first of July for ruta 
 bagas. Of the former we raised one season 1500 bush- 
 els and fed them with great advantage. The seed 
 tihould be soaked a couple of days previous to planting, 
 so as t-o germinate rapidly. The rows should be not less 
 than three feet apart, so as to admit of the passage of 
 the horse and cultivator, and sufficient seed should be 
 used to avoid the necessity of transplanting. They 
 should be thinned out to six or eight inches apart in the 
 row. We feed sugar beets to stock without chopping 
 up, and never found any inconvenience or danger from 
 choking. 

We shall speak of the other items of "Improved Farm- 
 ing" in next number.

CAPITAL IN FARMING. 

Although from general practice it would appear that 
 agriculture is thought to diifer from all other kinds of 
 business, and not require capital to conduct it, n-e do 
 not think so, and consider this very mistaken supposi- 
 tion as one of the great erroi's and hindrances to agri- 
 cultural improvement. 

A person buys a farm for $10,000. He stocks it for 
 $2,000 more, and considers no further outlays ne- 
 cessary, that the farm must hereafter support itself, and 
 any nett income beyond family and farm expenses should 
 be placed out at interest, and it is, as we think, actually 
 to the last dollar, abstracted from its proper and legiti- 
 mate duty on the farm. 

A manufacturer, mechanic or merchant would use the 
 same surplus to increase their facilities for doing more 
 business, buying new machinery or tools, new varieties 

of goods, or seeking new avenues of trade. Instead of 
 taking it out of their business they would reinvest it. 

A gain of six per cent, to a farmer is often a loss of 
 twelve per cent, from the farm. A large meadow of ten 
 acres is laying comparatively idle, or producing only 
 tussocks and sedge grass. Indeed we were once told by 
 a farmer of the old school, who had in front of his house 
 just such a piece of land, "that it looked very well be- 
 foi'e you went on to it, and the drovers would pay as 
 much for a night's pasture as if the grass was good." 
 Supposing this meadow to cost $100 per acre ($1,000), 
 and to yield a nett profit of ten per cent, or $100 in its 
 pregent condition, it would be a fair calculation to say, 
 that if properly drained its nett produce or profit would 
 be $200, or twenty per cent, on cost. But to do this 
 would prevent the owner from placing out at interest at 
 six per cent. ,'$200, the sum necessary to drain it. He 
 therefore lets it remain, and for want of investing this 
 $200 additional capital in his business sustains a loss 
 annually of $88, or over forty per cent on $200. 

A farmer may buy a cow for $25, making five lbs. of 
 butter per week. For $50 he can buy a cow making ten 
 pounds per week, and requiring no greater expense to 
 keep her. By jiutting the extra $25 out on mortgage at 
 six per cent., instead of investing it in a good cow, he 
 loses in six months the interest on $400 for one year, 
 counting the butter at 20 cents per pound. 

The same reasoning may very often be applied to im- 
 proved implements, manures and many other matters of 
 daily observation on the farm, where capital can be used 
 to as much or more advantage than in any other busi- 
 ness. 

We merely vash to call the attention of farmers to this 
 subject at present to do away with a very erroneous 
 idea, that fai-ming can be carried on without any capital 
 beyond the first outlay.

Facts and Principles in the Chemistry of Agricnltore. 

BY J. S. HOUGHTON, M. D. 

^lany persons who undertake to learn any science 
 think that they must try and remember a whole book, 
 with all its words, its illustrations, its tables, its discus- 
 sions, and even its preface and index, and in despair of 
 doing this give up the task of learning any thing as 
 hopeless. Now the true way of reading with profit is to 
 pay no special heed to the words of the author at all, 
 unless they are, for a single line or sentence, particular- 
 ly striking or beautiful, but to try and catch the chief 
 thought, if it has merit, and make that thought your 
 own. There is a vast deal of diflJ'erence between having 
 an intelligent knowledge of a book as you read it, and 
 making the substance of the book your own, so that you 
 can give it off from your own mind either in conversa- 
 tion or writing. 

The real matter of a book on agricultural chemistry, 
 for instance, may be set down in a few brief notes, on 
 half a sheet of paper, perhaps, and yet the author will 
 spread it out, in ivordu, through two or three hundred 
 pages. Now if you mark the important parts with a 
 pencil as you read, and then draw off these facts as 
 principles, on a bit of paper, the act of reflective atten- 
 tion, which this process requires, will enable you to
