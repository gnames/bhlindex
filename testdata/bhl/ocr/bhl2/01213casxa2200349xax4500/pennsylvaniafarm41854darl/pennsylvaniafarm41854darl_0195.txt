the whole history. There were some intermediate move- 
 ments that should be recorded. The great difiiculty was 
 to get action ; there were at that time but two or three 
 county societies in the State, and it seemed impossible 
 to procure an expi*ession of opinion from these quarters, 
 whose aid was felt to be necessary to secure. Most, 
 too, of the older and more cautious Pennsylvanians in 
 this quarter doubted even the possibility of interesting 
 the farmers sufficiently to induce them to come forward, 
 and take a part. To test this, as far as could be done, 
 a request was sent to the Bucks County Agricultural So- 
 ciety asking them to send delegates to meet our Society. 
 Twelve gentlemen came, but so little interest was felt by 
 the larger portion of our members, that but four were 
 present, Mr. Clement, Mr. Blight, Mr. Hai-rison and the 
 writer. We went through the usual foi-ms and formali- 
 ties of such occasions. Mr. .James C. Cornell was called 
 to the chair, some exhibition of eloquence was made, 
 resolutions passed, and adjournment moved, with an un- 
 derstanding that we were to meet again. So little feel- 
 ing for the object was shown by our Society, that the 
 delegates from Bucks came no more. The meeting and 
 its purpose was published, however; the Gerniantown 
 Telegraph taking the lead, and blowing a brazen note of 
 triumph on the glorious occasion. Not liking this apa- 
 thy, the writer communicated with gentlemen in the in- 
 terior as to whether a State Society should be attempted, 
 or one confined to the counties nearer Philadelphia. The 
 Hon. Frederick Watts met the matter with thatliberality 
 which will ever make the people of his native State his 
 debtors, and record his name with merited honor in her 
 annals. The idea of an address and a convention came 
 into the writer's hearing, and both of these were ably 
 and successfully carried out by members of the Society. 
 In this way was produced an institution, that, so far, 
 has been of the utmost value to the agricultural inter- 
 ests of the State. E.

 ■WHE4T, CHEAT, &c. 

Mr. Editor: — I feel much gratified in the perusal of 
 the Farm Journal, and you have my cordial wishes for 
 abundant success. It is doubtless destined like Aaron's 
 rod to swallow up all the small fry from New York, that 
 seek subsistence from the more genial soil of the Key- 
 stone State. 

In consequence of continued cold weather with late 
 snow, vegetation has been kept back through this region 
 until we have a late spring, which seems to favor the 
 prospects of a full crop of fruit. Our trees are now 
 loaded with blossoms, and never did the fields of wheat 
 along the branches of the Susquehanna present a more 
 favorable appearance. 

Having noticed in various agricultural papers a d" , 
 cussion of the probability of wheat turning to .icat, 
 and feeling some desire to arrive at a correct ^v^nclusion 
 in the matter, I submit the following sfeitcr .ent : — While 
 residing in Pickaway county, Ohio, in 1840, I saw a ten 
 aci-e field in which grew an excellent crop of wlicat the 
 preceding year, which having been left stand till being 
 quite ripe shelled during the process of harvesting suffi- 
 cient to seed the ground for another crop ; and in con- 
 sequence of moist weather it vegetated and grew, pre- 

senting a regular and favorable appearance for another 
 crop without the labor and expense of seeding, and it 
 actually turned out to be a full and good one. Tliis in- 
 duced Mr. Dresbach, the owner of the hind, to try it un- 
 plowed another year, by which experiment to know 
 whether the third crop could be harvested without plow- 
 ing. The appearances all seemed favorable until tlie 
 latter part of May, wlien we looked for the heads and 
 the grain to be formed, wlien lo ! the entire field was 
 turned to cheat — scarcely a head of wheat to be found 
 in it. 

This statement can be corroborated by numerous per- 
 sons still living at the place, and it shows conclusively 
 that there is an athnity between wheat and cheat. The 
 invariable laws of nature toacli us that "like usually 
 produces like," but there are freaks of nature, and it is 
 not more contraiy to the principles of philosophy, nor 
 to tlie agency of divine providence, to find an entire field 
 of wheat turning to cheat than for a single stock : and 
 not more of a freak of nature for a stalk of wheat to 
 turn to cheat than for a child to be born with the head 
 of a horse, or a calf with two heads — instances of wliich 
 may have been seen in the Philadelphia Hospital and 
 JIuseum. Owing to some disturbing cause and extrane- 
 ous influence animal malformations occur, and to similar 
 causes we may trace the fiact tlie liusbandman gathers 
 tares instead of wheat. Yours truly,

CHESTER COUNTY HOGS. 

Mr. Editor : — In the last number of your Journal 
 a Jersey correspondent gives an account of a lot of hogs 
 recently killed in that State, which certainly does credit 
 to the "land of sweet potatoes and water melons" in the 
 matter of growing good swine. But Jersey will have to 
 "try again" if she expects to catch up to Chester county 
 in this respect. Without intending it as a matter of 
 boasting, however, in this instance, I will give you p 
 sample of what we can do in these p.arts with our C 
 ter county breed of hogs. 

About this time last year I bought a s'~" ... a public 
 vendue in the neighborhood, which r> • ,oed me during 
 the summer a litter of nine pi?" ^ne sow was a very 
 fine one, and took a premiu>- .. the Agricultural Exhi- 
 bition last September. i,ne 1st of February she was 
 slaughtered and wp- .a G17 lbs. Her nine pigs were 
 killed at six w'-. ^.■> old and averaged 212 lbs., thus ma- 
 king an ae"'" ^gate of 2525 lbs. of pork ! 

Wha* .ues our friend at Hazledell Farm think of that? 
 Ca*- /ersey beat it ? H. J.

 CONDUCTORS. 
 Mr. Editor: — I have noticed, a few months ago, the 
 desti-uction of two barns by fire, neither of which had 
 been furnished with that safe and cheap remedy against 
 the power of the forked lightning — a conductor. Al- 
 though many farmers have been annually warned of 
 their danger — for in what year has not some barn or other 
 building been destroyed in Clicstcr or Delaware county ?
