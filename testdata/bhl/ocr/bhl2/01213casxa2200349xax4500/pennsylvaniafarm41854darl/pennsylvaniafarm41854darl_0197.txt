Mk. Editor — Sir : — As I believe in the old adage that 
 to prevent is better than to cure, I subjoin a mode of 
 preserving butter free from rancidity for a great length 
 of time: — Take two parts of good dry salt, one part of 
 good sugar, and one of nitre, and mix them. To every 
 pound of good fresh butter add one ounce of the above 
 mixture; woi-k it well together, and press it into jars for 
 use. It should be kept three weeks before used ; if it be 
 be sooner opened the salts will not be sufficiently blend- 
 ed with it. J. S. G

LAMBOEN'S TUBULAE BEE HIVE. 
 Friend Darlington : — I enclose a plan and descrip- 
 tion of my Patent Tubular Hive, which I would be 
 pleased to see recorded in your valuable Journal, if you 
 think it will interest any of your readers, and not crowd 
 out more important matter. I am well aware that 
 pamphlets and books without number have been wi'itten 
 upon the history and propagation of the bee, but the 
 work I shall recommend is the one I have studied my- 
 self, and from which I have copied my designs — I mean 
 the great book of nature. To understand the nature 
 and wants of the honey bee, you should follow them to 
 their wild abode, study their habits in their natural 
 state, and conform your management as near thereto as 
 your convenience will admit of. This is what I claim 
 for my hive. It is constructed on natural principles, 
 and like the native home of the bee, it will ever be found 
 free from the ravaging moths that so often fill those nu- 
 merous and re-re-numerous apartments of those useless 

arrest all depredatory insects and vermin which so com- 
 monly intrude upon and annoy these industrious little 
 communities in the commonly constructed hives. 

In the present construction, the bee enters the hive 
 througli an inverted truncated cone, and the cone being 
 filled with any kind of fluid is sure to arrest the ant or 
 any of the various insects, that often commit destructive 
 incursions on the hives now in general use. 

In the main entrance tube to the body of the hive is 
 fixed a spiral wire, which facilitates the pas.sing in and 
 out of the bees, and on cool mornings and evenings en- 
 ables them to suspend in solid column, which insures to 
 them a natural heat whilst on guard. The body of the 
 hive is so arranged that the nparian can remove any part 
 or parts of the hive at pleasure, without destroying a 
 single bee or leaving the combs in a mutilated or torn 
 condition. 

All creatures having more or less care for the security 
 of their young, the bee during this period selects the 
 heart or middle boxes of the hive. The aparian on this 
 occasion by strict attention may remove these boxes at 
 the proper season, and avoid the hitherto troublesome 
 task of hiving them in the old way. 

The Patent Tubular Hive has numerous decided ad- 
 vantages as regards the security and protection of the 
 bee in propagation and operation, over any ever before 
 offered to the public. 

From a hive thus constructed I have taken 150 H>s. 
 of honey in five weeks from the first entrance of the 
 bees therein, and have sold in a single season from one 
 hive 80 lbs. of honey. I have no doubt that ten hives 
 of bees, if properly managed, will iiett one hundred dol- 
 lars per year. ISRAEL LAMBORN.

CHIMNIES AND VENTILATION. 

Mr. Darlington: — As this is the season for building.. 
 I send you some practical suggestions in relation to 
 chimnies and ventilation, trusting the information they 
 contain may be of service to some of your numerous 
 readers. 

Masons and bricklayers usually construct chimnies at 
 random ; if they "draw," well, if not the unlucky ten- 
 ant must abstain from making a fire upon the hearth, or 
 bear the next evil in domestic matters to a scolding wife, 
 to wit, a smoky house. If a mason be asked why a 
 certain chimney "draws" and another does not. he will, 
 in nine cases out of ten, tell you "it will happen so 
 sometimes", while in most cases neither "draw" as well 
 as they should. There are certain principles necessary 
 to be observed in building chimnies, whichv if disregard- 
 ed, are as fatal to their draft, as a disregard to the 
 plumb, is to a wall, standing. 

First: — The heighth of the fire place should not much, 
 if any, exceed double its depth at the hearth. Second : 
 The "break" or "throat" should be about two-thirds the 

and fantastical contrivances — the majority of all "Mod- 1 depth of fire place at the hearth abeve the arch, and 
 ern Improved Bee Hives." The old political maxim, should be exactly the same size at the top as the int*nd- 
 "united we stand, divided we fall," will hold good in bee ! ed chimney. Third: — The chimney .-liould not be larger 
 hives as well as in other things. I than necessary to carry olf tlie smoke from ihe fire pla«o. 

Mine is a su.spen.«ion hive, and constructed so as to I and must be of uniform size throughout. Fourth :— The
