chimney should be raised above the houses near by, 
 which otherwise, when the wind blew from them towards 
 it, might occasion an eddie, or "blow down the chim- 
 ney." To illustrate my meaning more fully I will give 
 the following example : — Suppose a mason was required 
 to build a chimney, the fire place of which was to be two 
 feet and a half high and as many long, he would divide 
 the heighth (2 ft. 6 in.) by two for the depth (1 ft. 3 in.) 
 for the projection of the jambs. When he got to the 
 height for the arch and having ascertained the size de- 
 sired for the chimney, say ten inches on each side, which 
 gives au area of one hundred square inches, he com- 
 mences to "draw in" or narrow, so that the throat, ten 
 inches (two-thirds the depth of the fire place) above the 
 ai'ch, shall contain exactly one hundred inches. Its form 
 will be oblong, that is, it will be about twenty inches 
 long and five wide. This he will gradually bring to a 
 square of ten inches, but preserving the exact capacity, 
 and so carry up the chimney. 

A chimney thus built is the best ventilator possible for 
 a house. The chamber or room into which it opens will 
 always be free from foul air. A sleeping apartment 
 with such a chimney will not send forth its occupant of 
 the night lank and lethargic, consequent upon breathing 
 over and over again the carbonic exhalations from the 
 lungs, stagnated in the lower strata of the atmosphere, 
 but fresh and buoyant from a night's repose sweetened 
 by inhaling pure air only. 

The practice of ventilating sleeping apartments by 
 ventilators near the ceiling is becoming common in defi- 
 ance of all experience and common sense. The principle 
 impurity in them is carbonic acid, given off by the lungs 
 in breathing. This gas is slightly heavier than the at- 
 mosphere, and naturally sinks to the lowest strata. 
 Chimnies of ffood draft will carry it ofi", but it never rises 
 of its own accord. Consequently a flue at the ceiling 
 carries ofiF the upper strata of air, leaving the foul at- 
 mosphere below if there be no chimney with a strong 
 draft. 

Attention to this matter will save many a doctor's bill, 
 and promote health and happiness.

For the Farm Journal. 
 Plagiarism, &c. 
 Mr. Editor : — Having lately become a subscriber to 
 your valuable Journal, I have been much interested and 
 instructed by many of the articles I find therein, — the 
 experience of practical farmers being a prominent and 
 judicious feature in the work — and much good sound 
 sense and useful information may be found in the re- 
 marks of many of your correspondents, whose expe- 
 rience and observation have qualified them to speak un- 
 derstandingly of the subjects they treat on in their 
 communications. 

But one of your correspondents — a frequent one, by- 
 the-by — it seems is ambitious of earning a high reputa- 
 tion, not only for agricultural, but literary and scientific 
 attainments. Looking over the April number a short 
 time since, I was struck by seeing an article, over the 
 signature of J. S. G. (of Media), which seemed rather 
 above the level of that gentleman's usual sentiments and 
 style of composition, and on further perusal I found that 
 I was perfectly familiar with the article in question; Mr. 
 J. S. Q. having copied the whole, verbatim et literatim, 

from the writings of Buckminster, with the exception of 
 a few amendations of his own — how much he has im- 
 proved (?) the elegant simplicity of the style of that ad- 
 mired author, I leave your readers to judge: as thej' can 
 easily do by comparing his with the original, which is to 
 be found in an extracted form in some of our school 
 books — Emerson's First Class Reader for one, I think; 
 the heading being "Rural Occupations favorable to De- 
 votion." 

Also, if Mr. .J. S. G. admires that author as much aa 
 I do, he may find the piece in question, as well as seve- 
 ral "more of the same sort" by the same, in the "Com- 
 mon Place Book of Prose;" from whence he may transfer 
 some more, if he chooses, into the "Farm Journal" in full, 
 only next time let him have the candor to acknowledge 
 where he gets them, as when people see an article in a 
 Journal over any person's signature, they are apt to 
 think that he claimed to be the author of it, especially if 
 he mentions no other and puts no quotation marks about 
 it. As for myself I may be singular in my tastes, but I 
 prefer the original authorities to any of J. S. G.'s 
 abridgements or alter.ations ; whether the subject be sci- 
 entific, like his essay concerning those a7its that keep dai- 
 ries, or literally as the one before mentioned. 

Another article that particularly drew my attention 
 was one in the last May number, headed "To Compute 
 Interest," as I expected to find some new and shorter 
 method for doing it, whereas the one given by your corres* 
 pondent is to be found in all our arithmetics, (late ones 
 at least — perhaps not in Pike's which G. W. P. may have 
 studied in his "school boy daj's,") and I am much mis- 
 taken if it is not the method used by bank officers and 
 business men generally to calculate interest for any small 
 number of days. I am surprised that any one who has 
 done so much public business as G. W. P. has, (I take 
 it,) should have learned the method in question so lately 
 and from a Baltimore paper — however, he is in error 
 when he says it is correct — it is not at all perfectly so, 
 though it will answer for small amounts with sufficient 
 accuracy. It is founded on the assumption that 30 days 
 make a month, and consequently 360 a year. Now let 
 us test its accuracy, say to find the interest of $1000 for 
 78 days at six per cent. The interest of that sum for 
 one year or 865 days would obviously be $60, and as 
 78 days is one-fifth of that time, the true interest will be 
 one-fifth of $60, or $12. Now by his rule— divide the 
 number of days by 6; 73 days divided by 6 gives 12 J^, 
 which being multiplied by $1000 gives 12160j mills, or 
 $12 IGf, being an excess of 16f cents over the true in- 
 terest. Though G. W. P. kindly inserted the "method" 
 for the benefit I suppose of some of our farmers, who 
 are "slow" at calculating interest, I think that if any of 
 them were to ask their sons at the public school — leav- 
 ing out those at the "Academy" — for a "way" to compute 
 it they would get the said rule for an answer — or a better 
 one. Truly yours, B. W. W.

Lioe on Chickens. 

Mr. Editor : — Can you, or any of the readers of the 

Journal, inform a subscriber how lice on chickens can be 

destroyed. Sometimes they become so numerous as to
