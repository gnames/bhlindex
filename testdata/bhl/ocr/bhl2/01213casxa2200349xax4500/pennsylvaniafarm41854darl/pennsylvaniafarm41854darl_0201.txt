no small iuterost to inquire what are some of the means 
 adapted to accumulate and preserve manure. 

In all cases where it can be conveniently done, domestic 
 animals should be fed in a stable, in order to protect them 
 from the sun and rains in summer, and the cold and storms 
 of winter. In this way the droppings of the stock is not 
 exposed to the weather, iis rain and sunshine are admirably 
 calculated to extract the fertilizing qualities of manure. 
 There should also be a good yard connected with the stables, 
 furnished with a good roof, in which the cattle may run 
 when not stabled. When the manure is removed, the yard 
 should bo covered to the depth of six inches or more with 
 Bwamp muck, leaves from the forest, sawdust, turf, straw, or 
 any other suitable substance to absorb and retain the liquid. 
 By being mixed with the droppings of the cattle, any of these 
 substances will become as good as common barnyard ma- 
 nure. The manure from the stables should be thrown into 
 the yard in heaps, composting it with muck, leached ashes, 
 or if the soil is deficient in alkali, which our old soils gener- 
 ally are, better unleached ashes, adding plaster to fix the 
 ammonia, salt, soap suds from the wash house, and chamber 
 ley from every quarter. 

Lime should never be used in compost with animal ma- 
 nure, as it sets free the ammonia which is the life of the ma- 
 nures. The farmer's hogs should be kept at making ma- 
 nure; keep their yard well supplied with straw, leaves from 
 the forest, and by all means the weeds that grow in such 
 profusion about the yards, and they will convert the whole 
 into good manure, and grow fat in the meantime. But the 
 only efiectual method of preserving it from waste is to keep 
 it under cover, as it is estimated that it will lose at least one- 
 third in value by being subject to the weather, and where it 
 has great facilities for natural drainage much more. 

The farmer should be as thoughtful of sheltering his ma- 
 nure as his domestic animals. The privy should be con- 
 structed with a portable box under the seat with handles, so 
 that it could be removed as often as occasion might require, 
 and emptied on the manure heap. This box should often 
 receive a liberal supply of charcoal and plaster. All the 
 weeds and refuse productions on the farm of this kind should 
 be collected while green, and piled in the barnyard for ma- 
 nure. It is estimatad that a ton of dry plants will yield 
 five hundred of dry mould. Hence five hundred of this 
 mould will sufiicc to grow jit least a ton of cultivated plants. 
 Thus the economical farmer may constantly crop his field, 
 .■vnd yet constantly enrich it with the refuse and waste mat- 
 ter of its own productiveness. JESSE GORSUCH.

 THE PROGRESSIVE FARMER. 

Mu. Editou : — I have a little volume of some 250 pages, 
 called the "Progressivv> Farmer," by Professor Nash, and 
 from the press of that indefatigable publisher, C. M. Saxton, 
 New York, and which, by the way, I was induced to pur- 
 chase from a fiivornble notice of it in the Farm Journal 
 i--omc few months since. I keep this little book lying on 
 the table in my sitting room, so that I can pick it up for a 
 Ci.'w minutes of an evening, or other leisure times, and 
 though I have read it through at least half a dozen times, 
 \ct I seldom open it without being more and more interested 
 iu its eontent^•, or gathering some now ideas upon the wide 
 range of subject.s connected with agriculture. It contains 
 more real practical knowledge upon every important depart- 
 ment of the farm, than any publication of the same size I 
 have ever met with. I have what I consider a very respecta- 
 ble agricultural library, embracing such voluminous works 
 as ".Stephen's Book of the Faim," "Colman's .\griculti:ro," 

&c.. Ac, and yet I would not exchange the "Progressive 
 Farmer" for any two works in my possession. 

I don't know, Mr. Editor, that I can do the numerous 
 readers of the Farm Journal a greater favor than to send 
 you an occasional selection from this work. Those who are 
 in the reach of bookstores, or agricultural warehouses, 
 where such publications are kept for sale, I would advise to 
 buy it at once. They cannot invest half a dollar more ad- 
 vantageously in the book line I am confident. 

I will select, on the present occasion. Prof. Nash's views 
 upon deep ploichti]. There is some diversity of opinion 
 upon this point even among our good farmers, and should 
 there be among your readers any who believe that 
 "shallow plowing is the best for a corn crop," — which 
 may be considered the doctrine of the "old fogies" in agri- 
 culture — I would be glad if they will read the following re- 
 marks, and report in the next number of the Farm Journal, 
 wherein the views of Prof. Nash are contrary to rea.'on and 
 common sense. 1 remain your:^, A PROGIIE.SSIVE. 

DEEP PLOWING. 

From what was suid on the subject of capillary attraction, 
 we derive important rules with regard to plowing. The up- 
 ward and downward movement of the water extends far into 
 the ground, if there is no impervious stratum. If there is 
 a stratum near the surface through which water cannot pa.^s 
 freelj-, an important process of nature favorable to vcgeta- , 
 tion is impeded. The water of excessive rains should pass 
 off without obstruction into the earth, and the upward fiow 
 of water, after evaporation, should be unimpeded, in order 
 to supply the surface soil after a drouth. All who have tri^d 
 deep plowing have become satisfied that their fields are dryer 
 for it in rainy weather, and moister in dry weather. This 
 accords perfectly with the principles now explained. There 
 may bo soils lying on so porous a subsoil that it would b« 
 well to cultivate shallow. The farmer must look to this. In 
 extreme cases, he maj' find a subsoil so open and porous tba^ 
 to stir it might be like knocking the bottom out, to kt his 
 top-soil fall into the earth and be lost among coarse peb- 
 bles. 

Whenever the soil is deep and the subsoil compact, there 
 can be no doubt that deep plowing is greatly beneficial. If 
 plants can have ten inches of loosened soil into which lo 
 thrust their roots for food, they are like a herd of cattle in a 
 pasture of fen aere.< ; while if they have but five, they are 
 like the same herd confined to a five acre lot. 

On all ordinary soils, plowing should be at least ten inches 
 deep ; and then, if the soil below that deptli appears hard 
 and compact, especially if there is anything like a .<hcll or 
 crust, tlirough which water cannot pass freely, it fchould bo 
 stirred with the subsoil plow a.i much deeper. The wafer 
 can then pass up and down freely. All danger from exces- 
 sive rains is removed, because thti wafer readily passes away 
 from the roofs of plant<; and all danger from drouth is re- 
 moved, or nearly all, because the water will freely pass up- 
 ward by capilhary attraction : and it should be remembered 
 that every particle of water which rises towanis the siirfac, 
 comes loaded with salts, which it brings from deep in the 
 earth and deposits within reach of the roots of jilantf. 
 Water so rising is never pure. If i: cnt<;rs the roots of 
 plants, it carries salf.s along with it. If it evaporates, it 
 leaves its salts behind, having brought them uji no doubt in 
 many cases from deeper in tlic ground than roots pene- 
 trate. 

Thus we see that water net? not only as the drink cf 
 plants, which they fake in principally by their roots, but 
 also as the carrier of food for them. It wiL«hes the air of all 
 those impurities which would render it unfit to breathe.
