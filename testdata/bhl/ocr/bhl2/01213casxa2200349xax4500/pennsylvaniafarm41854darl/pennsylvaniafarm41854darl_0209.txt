common feeling, a desire tobe useful, became agriculturalists, 
 always look to the amount of produce more than to that of 
 profit. This constitutes the broad difference between the 
 poor and prudent man who works, and the rich and reckless 
 man who hires. The one has no ideal before him of perfect 
 cultivation, he labors under no hallucination, formed from 
 conceit and ignorance of his own superior qualifications, he 
 knows and feels that life is with him a desperate struggle, 
 that in case of failure ho has nothing to fall back on, and 
 when reports come to him of some one having raised fifty 
 bushels or more of wheat to the acre, or a hundred bushels 
 or more of corn, or other extraordinary and incredible facts in 
 farming, he considers and calculates the cost and the outlay 
 necessary to bring land into a condition so productive, and 
 not the amount produced. The other sees visions and 
 dreams dreams; he seeks fame, he is chronicled in a news- 
 paper or a periodical as having whispered to the elements, 
 or waved a wand over the earth, by which processes, un- 
 known in general agriculture, crops, unprecedented in quan- 
 tity, have sprung beneath his feet, but the cost is unknown 
 — the powers with whom he is allied in his supernatural per- 
 formances are concealed, the amount of money lost and 
 thrown away is not revealed, and his farm ledger and bal- 
 ance sheet are as mysterious and obscure to the anxious pub- 
 lic as a Mormon bible. 

To the first of these persons, the question of the results of 
 high farming is one of great importance ; on it depends his 
 advancement and the progress of his art, to the other it is of 
 less moment, as he may continue to manure his land with 
 gold and silver without ruin, though it is probable he will, in 
 the end, be wearied and disgusted with the process, and tired 
 ■with being an unappreciated victim of what is, in reality, 
 his own folly and vanitj*. E.

DOMESTIC RECIPES. 

To Boil Ham. — Cut some slices of ham a quarter of an 
 inch thick, soak them in hot water for half an hour, or give 
 thorn a scalding in a pan over the fire; then take them up 
 and lay them on a gridiron, over bright coals; v/hen the outr- 
 side is browned, turn the other ; then take the slices on a hot 
 dish, butter them freely, sprinkle pepper over, and serve. 
 Or, after scalding them, wipe them dry, dip each slice in 
 beaten eggs, then into rolled crackers, and fry or broil. 

Skippers ix Bacon. — I cure my hams with salt, sugar 
 and saltpetre ; after remaining down four weeks, as I take 
 up the hams from the salt, I rub each piece on the flesh side 
 w ith fine black pepper, and then hang up and smoke, a dark 
 brown color, with green hickory wood, and then let it hang 
 until wanted for use. Sometimes they have hung two years. 
 Before I commenced using the pepper, I had to take my 
 hams down and pack in ashes in the spring of the year. 
 The above plan will prevent skippers in bacon. 

Cor:? Brkad. — -Everybody who has been at the Mansion 
 House, at Buffalo, New York, has learned the luxury of the 
 corn bread there provided. The clerk is often taxed to 
 write directions for home manufacture, and I thus procured 
 a recipe for domestic use, which I copy for you, so that those 
 wiio wish may try a jjiece of bread from the Mansion. It is 
 So follows : ''One quart of sour milk, two table spoonfuls of 
 saleratus, four ounces of butter, three table spoonfuls of 
 flour, three eggs, and corn meal suflScient to make a stiflT 
 b:ittcr. 

How TO Mend Broken China or Glasswark. — Mrs. 
 William Shelton. of Frankford, Pa., sends us the following 
 recipe for mending broken china or glassware ; we do not 
 know that the discovery is original with Mrs. S.,but she has 
 long used it with invariable success. Take unslaked lime, 
 made fine by pounding or grinding, which mix with the 

white of an egg to the consistence of starch or paint ; thor- 
 oughly cleanse and drj- the edges to be united, then apply 
 the mixture to the parts to be cemented, place them together 
 firmly, and let them become perfectly dry. Articles thus 
 mended can be handled or washed without injury. 

Chicken Pie. — Joint the chickens, which should bo 
 young and tender — boil them in just sufficient water to cover 
 them. When nearly tender, take them out of the liquor, 
 and lay them in a deep pudding dish, lined with pie crust. 
 To each layer of chicken, put three or four slices of pork — 
 add a little of the liquor in which they were boiled, and a 
 couple of ounces of butter, cut into small pieces — sprinkle a 
 little flour over the whole, cover it with nice pie crust, and 
 ornament the top with some of your pastry. Bake it in a 
 quick oven one hour. 

Muffins. — Mix a quart of wheat flour smoothly with a 
 pint and a half of lukewarm milk, have a tea cup of j'east, 
 a couple of beaten eggs, a heaping tea spoonful of salt, and 
 a couple of table spoonfuls of lukewarm melted butter. Set 
 the batter in a warm place to rise. When light, butter your 
 muffin cups, turn in the mixture and bake the mufiins till a 
 light brown. 

Lemon Pie. — For one pie, take a couple of good sized 
 fresh lemons, squeeze out the juice, and mix it with half a 
 pint of molasses, or suflicient sugar to make the juice sweet- 
 Chop the peel fine, line deep pio plates with your pastry, 
 then sprinkle on a layer of your chopped lemon peel, turn 
 in part of the mixed sugar or molasses and juice, then cover 
 the -whole with pie crust, rolled very thin — put in another 
 layer of peel, sweetened juice, and crust, and so on till all 
 the lemon is used. Cover the whole with a thick crust, and 
 bake the pie about half an hour. 

Dyspepsia Bread. — Three quarts of unbolted wheat 
 meal ; 1 quart of soft warm water ; a gill of fresh yeast, a 
 gill of molasses, 1 tea spoonful of saleratus. This will make 
 two loaves, and should remain in the oven at least two hours. 
 It will need from eight to twelve hours to rise. 

Pound Cake. — One pound dried sifted flour, the same of 
 loaf sugar, and the whites of twelve eggs and the yolks of 
 seven. Beat the butter to a cream, add the sugar by de- 
 grees, then the eggs and flour ; beat it all well together for 
 an hour, mixing a table spoonful of rose water, a little nut- 
 meg or cinnamon, two cups of cream, and a tea spoonful of 
 saleratus. To be baked in a quick oven. 

Breakfast Butter Cakes. — One quart of sour milk, 
 one tea spoonful saleratus, a little salt, one and a half cup* 
 of boiled rice, two table spoonfuls of molasses or half cup of 
 sugar, a little ginger, and flour enough to make a stiff bat- 
 t«r. 

Butter Cakes for Tea. — Beat two eggs, put them in 
 half pint of milk, and a tea cup of cream, with half a tea 
 spoonful of saleratus dissolved in the cream, a little salt, 
 cinnamon and a little rose water if you like, stir in sifted 
 flour till the batter is smooth and thick. Bake them on a 
 griddle or in a pan. Butter the pan well, drop the batter in 
 small round cakes and quite thin. They must be turned 
 and nicely browned. Lay them on a plate, in a pile, with u 
 little butter between each layer. 

To Sweeten Rancid Butter. — It is said that washing 
 rancid butter in milk, and afterwards in water, will restore to 
 former sweetness. The experiment is easily tried, and the 
 "consummation devoutly to be wished," for surely nothing 
 is more repulsive than rancid butter. 

To SEriTRE Bacon from the Flv.— A writer in the Ameri- 
 can Farmer recommends as an infalliable remedy against 
 the fly : When your bacon is smoked early in the spring 
 before the fly has made its appearance, take quick lime slack- 
 ed to a drj- powder, and rub the meat thoroughly on every
