bute for the sucUlen and unexpected loss it and the commu- 
 nity have sustained in the death of an enlightened philanthro- 
 pist, an upright, benevolent citizen, and a public spirited 
 benefactor. 

Resolved, That the generous bequest of $5,000 to this 
 Society, by the will of the late Elliot Cresson, towards the 
 erection aud support of an Agricultural College, demands 
 our grateful and unfeigned thanks, and commands the sym- 
 pathy and respect of every farmer throughout the land. 

Resolved, That the Pennsvlvania State Agricultural So- 
 ciety will, and do herebj' accept the bequest made to it by 
 the will of the late Elliot Cresson , Esq.'r, and hereby pledge 
 the Sttciety to the faithful application of the same to the 
 object designated by the will of the testator. 

Resolved, That these proceedings be published in the daily 
 and weekly papers of Philadelphia and Harrisburg, and that 
 a copy of the same be presented to his venerable lady mother, 
 as a token of "The Pennsylvania Agricultural Society's" re- 
 spect and gratitude to the memory of her noble son, and of 
 deep sympathy in her beravement. 

Greology and Agriculture. 

A correspondent of one of our English exchanges states 
 that in these days, when agriculture is regarded as a scien- 
 tific pursuit, and chemistry and engineering are held up 
 aa her crutches, we are apt to forget that there is another 
 science to which the agriculturist is deeply indebted, name- 
 ly, geology. It is not meant that the importance of geology 
 is overlooked by scientific men ; the able works of Professor 
 Johnson, Mr. Morton, and others, prove that it is not from 
 thoee that geology receives her slight, it is from the practical 
 farmer ; he speaks with due gratitude of the chemist, who 
 has opened to him rich sources of fertility in now artificial 
 manures, and has taught him how to make the most of those 
 already at his command ; he is not unthankful to the engi- 
 neer whose genius has lessened the cost of production by 
 improvements in his implements, and by the removal, by 
 means of drainage, of all surplus water ; but he passes by 
 the labors of the geologist, who point.s out to him the gen- 
 eral characteristics and phj-sical properties of his soil, di- 
 rects him where and at what depth he maj- expect to find 
 marl, lime, or other minerals, who by his maps indicates 
 where he will find such a soil as will suit him, and by com- 
 paring districts of a like geological character, can tell hini 
 what plants are likely to succeed best in any given district. 
 But these are advantages which the farmer is very apt to 
 forget, probably because he does not avail himself of them 
 to that extent which he might. Geology is a science, the 
 study of which the agriculturist would find of great value to 
 him, and yet one which he habitually neglects. 

Milch Cows and Fattening Calves. 

A little consideration will convince any one that milch 
 cows are kept in a more artificial condition than any other 
 of our domestic animals. Wo force them, in many cases, to 
 give milk ten months of the year. Whereas, all'that other 
 animals — sh.?op, swine, horses, <tc. — are required to do in 
 this respect, is to aftord sustenance to their young. It would 
 seem, therefore, that while in all animals the latter period 
 of gestation and parturition are attended with more or less 
 danger : in the case of the milch cow. the danger is consid- 
 erably heightened, sufficiently so, at least, to warrant the 
 greatest care and attention. 

Cows that are not milked can be kept in fair condition 
 through the winter upon good straw and corn stalks. But 
 towards spring, soy six weeks before calving, they should 
 have a little hay, or shorts. When fed on a bulky or com- 
 paratively innutritious food, such as straw or stalks, there is 
 a danger of costiveness, and more or less inflammation. A 
 more concentrated food would prevent this complaint. Wo 
 know of nothing better than three or four pounds of oil- 
 cake meal per day. Not only is it highly nutritious, but it 

is slightly aperient, and, therefore, just .suited to the case. 
 Mangel wurzels, too, are aperient — much more so than ruta 
 bagas or potatoes, but we do not know how they compare, 
 in this respect, with beets or parsnips. Every dairyman, 
 and in fact every farmer who keeps a cow, should have a 
 few roots, at least, to feed out in the spring of the year. 
 Nothing can paj' better. 

Slipping the calf, or slinking, is not uncommon, and is at- 
 tended not merely with the loss of the calf, but with great 
 injury and danger to the cow. The cause of this trouble- 
 some complaint is to be ascribed to violent exercise, fright 
 and knocks, or other ill treatment. A more common cause 
 of slinking, is a disagreeable, nauseous smell. For this rea- 
 son, the cow stables should be well ventilated, and kept scru- 
 pulously clean at this season. Esjiecially should caution be 
 exercised in killing hogs, bleeding horses, Ac., for cows have 
 a mortal antipathy to blood, aud nothing is so productive of 
 slinking, as carelessness in these particulars. 

The best time for cows to '"come in," depends much on 
 circumstances. Usually, where cows are kcj)t for the dairy, 
 in the north eastern and western States, about tbc middle of 
 April is considered best. Though, where the calves are 
 raised for the butcher, in the neighborhood of cities, where 
 early veal commands a high price, it will be profitable to 
 have them colne in earlier. 

If the cow is in a healthy condition, little trouble will be 
 experienced in calving. After the cow has calved, she 
 should have some warm bran slops, and be carefully attend- 
 ed to. The first milk ought to be drawn out of tiie bag be- 
 fore the calf is allowed to suck ; and afterwards, if the bag 
 should become hard, as very frequently happens, it is advi- 
 sable to draw out as much of the milk as possible, previous 
 to letting the calf suck. In this way, from the calf butting 
 the udder and drawing the milk out clean, a cure is speedily 
 effected. If, however, the udder should be much inflamed, 
 it should, in addition to drawing out the milk, be well rub- 
 bed with buttermilk and castile soap. 

In some districts, it may be the best economy to sell oflF 
 the calves when a week or ten days old, or even to cut their 
 throats as soon as thej- are born — the milk proving more 
 valuable when converted into cheese and butter, than into 
 veal. .Such, however, is not the case when good veal sells, 
 as it does here, at from six to ten cents per pound, unless 
 the butter should command an unusually high and exhorbi- 
 tant price. 

In fattening calves for the butcher, they should be sucked 
 regularly, be tied up in a dark, clean .■stable, and have a lit- 
 tle fresh, clean straw thrown under them every day. Much 
 depends on their being kept clean, dry and quiet. In suck- 
 ling them, let the strap remain round their necks, so that 
 j'ou can manage them more easilj*. Take them away as soon 
 as they have had their fill, and do not let them run about 
 the cow stable or yard. If they are kept clean, they will 
 not bo troubled with lice. If they should be, give them a 
 little sulphur; it will both purify the blood and rid them of 
 the parasite. 

After, as before parturition, the main difficulty with cows 
 is costiveness. A feed of magel wurzel, or two pounds of 
 oil cake meal made into a warm mash, will be found the best 
 preventive. The increase of milk will pay for the oil cake, 
 while the increased health and strength of the cow will bo 
 pure gain, and will tell well in the milk pail during the sum- 
 mer. It is absolutely essential that cows be milked clean 
 at all times, but especially is it necessary immediately after 
 calving. 

It is hardly necessary to remind our readers that it is ab- 
 solutely necessary, at all these times, to be good natured 
 and kind to cows. Especially should it be remembered at 
 this se.ison. Never suflTer yourself to fall into a passion 
 with a perverse cow. It will do no good, and much mis- 
 chief. Kindness and gentleness to all animals is politic, but 
 with milch cows it is absolutely essential. However unruly 
 and ugly a cow, or especially a heifer, uniy be, never boat or 
 kicV: her; harsh treatment only makes the matter worse, 
 while kindness will tame a tartar. 

To Cure Founder. 

The Ohio Cultivator gives the following recipe for curing 
 the founder — more correctly speaking the water-founder : — 
 '•Bleed the horse from the neck a.« long as ho can stand up ; 
 then make him swallow one pint of salt: anoint well around 
 the edges of his hoofs with spirits of turpentine ; keep him 
 from drinking too much water, und ho will be well in a few 
 hours."
