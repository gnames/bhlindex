Scraping and Washing Fruit Trees. 

"71)0 much Fhilonophy hath made thee mad." 
 In this pi-ogressive age, wlicn mind seems actually to 
 have broken loose from ancient moorings and land 
 marks, when new ideas and discoveries before unheard 
 or unthought of, however startling, cease to produce any 
 wonderment, because they are soon succeeded by others 
 no less so, there may be a real danger and loss to the 
 farmer and horticulturist from the too hasty adoption of 
 new fangled theories. There seems to be no attraction 
 now for aught but new things in many branches of in- 
 dustry and most departments of science. Old fogyism 
 is dying off, and soon young America will have sole pos- 
 session of the field. The genus Homo has been various- 
 ly described by naturalists. Lord Monboddo's defini- 
 tion was "that man is an animal who has worn oflF his 
 tail by an absurd practice of setting on chairs." Some 
 have defined him as one who uses tobacco, no other ani- 
 mal using the vile weed. Others as an animal who bar- 
 gains, no other biped or quadruped being known to make 
 deliberate exchanges. It seems to us that, at least in 
 the United States, man may be defined to be "an animal 
 that meets in convention and passes resolutions." Town 
 and county meetings, congresses, conventions on every 
 conceivable subject and on every conceivable occasion, 
 seem to be the ruling passion, the order of the day. 
 Nothing can now be done, hardly the laws of nature es- 
 tablished 4000 years ago be allowed to run their eternal 
 circuit, without some solemn conclave or other, and the 
 passage of a very formidable set of resolutions. 

We are induced to make these remarks by the receipt 
 of a pamphlet, entitled "an enquiry into the uses and 
 abuses of the practice of scraping and washing trees, by 
 a committee of the Massachusetts Horticultural Socie- 

ty-" 

The action of the Society on the reading of the report 
 and resolutions was that they be printed, and then laid 
 on the table. Believing that they are calculated to do a 
 vast amount of injury (unless good results indirectly 
 from their absurdity), it would have been better we think 
 for the Society to have put them under the table previ- 
 ous to printing and circulating. 

Such premises and conclusions are calculated to pro- 
 duce real disgust in the practical farmer and gardener 
 against what is commonly styled book fi\rming, and to 
 give a real embodiment and form to this imarjinary enemy 
 to improvement. It is not to be wondered at, when those 
 who have tried and knotv the great advantages of wash- 
 ing the trunks of fruit and other trees read such reso- 

lutions, that book farming should be a by-word of re- 
 proach. The recommendations of the committee are so 
 opposed to all our experience and practice, and also we 
 believe true scientific theory, that they struck us almost 
 like burlesque. We hope the appreciation of the beau- 
 tiful will in Pennsylvania differ entirely from that in 
 Massachusetts, "where lichens and mosses in all their 
 varied colors and forms on the bark are considered chief- 
 est ornaments." AVe advise our farmers and gardeners 
 to find beauties elsewhere, and so soon as they discover 
 "these chiefest ornaments" about their fruit or oi-namen- 
 tal trees, to get to work immediately with a swab and 
 plenty of soft soap and lye, mixed in equal parts, or a 
 solution of one pound of potash to five gallons of water, 
 and apply it day after day till they are all clean gone, 
 and the bark shows signs of health &uA pliability. 

The committee seem to think every thing should be 
 left to nature, "that she is the only true guide in horti- 
 cultural operations, and that any aim to reduce rough 
 bark to smooth, or vice versa, is decidedly unscientific." 
 If this solemn resolution, No. 4, means any thing, it im- 
 plies the very opposite of "man's earning his bread by 
 the sweat of his brow ;" that we have only to sit still 
 and watch nature to do every thing for us. Our advice 
 to the farmer and fruit grower is to make art assist na- 
 ture; to study to guard against the thousand causes of 
 disease and death, which on all sides interfere with hia 
 best efforts, both on the farm, in the garden, in the or- 
 chard ; to watch the habits and modes of preventing the 
 ravages of insects ; to aim, like the skilful physician, to 
 ward off or moderate the force of disturbing causes, 
 which demand the greatest amount of activity and intel- 
 ligence to obtain either fine fruit, or healthy, luxuriant 
 foliage. 

Mosses and lichens, bark lice, aphis, &c., so far from 
 being "ornaments," we always consider evidences of 
 want of vitality in the bark, through the inner coating 
 of which the sap descends, and on a healthy condition of 
 which depends very much the health of the tree. These 
 "ornaments" are very apt to attach to newly transplant- 
 ed trees, prey upon and draw their life from it, and 
 there can be no rapid and healthy growth unless they 
 are speedily removed. The bark is part of the circula- 
 ting system, and in both vegetable and animal economy 
 the law holds good, that the healthy condition of every 
 portion of the mechanism is necessary to the health of 
 the whole. What fruif grower has not seen the benefit 
 of applications, which transform a rough, bark bound, 
 hard and sluggish exterior surface into one bright, soft
