The diflficulties of a regular system of soiling in the 
 tlnited States consist chiefly in the high price and scar- 
 city of labor, the want of a rapid renewal and succession 
 of crops for a supply of green food, and the backward- 
 ness of early spring growth. In England they grow 
 winter vetches, rye, Italian rye grass, lucern, &c., which 
 seem to give exactly the proper succession for soiling, 
 with continuous gi'owth for nearly the whole year. The 
 first objection respecting labor will not be found so great 
 on trial, and indeed a few minutes operation of a mow- 
 ing machine, now coming into general use, may obviate 
 it entirely. We know of one case where twenty cows 
 are kept up all the year round, and through the season 
 of pasture the attention of a single extra man is all 
 sufficient. Being accustomed to stock ranging over 
 large fields, tramping and otherwise destroying of their 
 abundance, we are not aware how small a quantity of 
 grass is really ample enough for a meal. Enough only 
 should be given, and all superfluous leavings should be 
 immediately removed. A suitable interval then allowed, 
 the length of which, as well as quantity, can only be de- 
 termined by the close observation and undivided atten- 
 tion of the attendant. In the soiling system, we greatly 
 prefer small yards to stabling. Shade, shelter in stormy 
 weather, a plentiful supply of water, and constant access 
 to salt, are also essential. The intervals between the 
 feeds the man can most profitably occupy by attention to 
 the manure and compost heap ; the profits from this at- 
 tention, such as shovelling up the yards, wheeling the 
 manure imder the shed, composting it with soil from the 
 headlands, plaster, &c., saving the liquid manure and 
 pumping it up for occasional distribution over the heap, 
 would .alone doubly pay all his wages. 

In respect to a succession of suitable crops, there is 
 apparently more difficulty here than in England, in its 
 very moist and more equable climate and shorter win- 
 ters. We cannot speak so certainly about lucern, but 
 the rye grass grows most luxuriantly in Chester county, 
 and in fair seasons will bear three successive cuttings. 
 Stock are very fond of it, and will eat it in preference 
 sometimes to our natural green grass. 

Then we h.ave a most extraordinary crop for a system 
 of soiling in Indian corn, drilled in rows, which is highly 
 nutritious, grows fast, and j-ields enormous products to 
 the acre. ^lany successive sowings can be made, and 
 together with rye, rye grass, and our red clover, will 
 make an agreeable variety for stock. 

The regular culture of root crops should also be indis- 
 pensable. Those fed late in the winter particularly, or 
 early spring, before grass is abundant, are much relished 
 and greatly promote the health of animals. 

On the whole oiir conclusion is that soiling, judicious- 
 ly and economically conducted, will p<iy, and We hope to 
 hear of experiments with it the present season

Sweet-Scented Vernal Grass. 
 In our last number (page 172) we published a communi- 
 cation by Dr. EMERS0>f, which had been originately written 
 for and published in the Boston Cultivator, stating in an 
 editori.al prefixed that we had been furnished with a copy by 
 the author. The editor of the Cultivator recently replied to 
 this conmiunication, and also furnished us with a copy for 
 publication in the Farm Journal, which wo cheerfully do : 

On the ISth of March last we published the following 
 p;irii graph : 

"Several i)apers are recommending the swect-,=cented ver- 
 nal grass (Anthoxanthuni odoratum) as a good pasture grass 
 for cows. We hope no one will be induced to try it, as there 
 are many better kinds. It is a mistake that the excellence 
 of Philadelpliia butter is owing to this grass. The idea 
 never could have proceeded from an nl)scrving farmer. Cows 
 are not fond of it, and only eat it when better cannot be 
 had. The June grass (I'oa pratcnsis) abounds in many pas- 
 tures around Phihidelphia. It is one of the sweetest and 
 most nutritive grasses, and is well known to be one of the 
 best for fiedLug dairy and fattening cattle."
