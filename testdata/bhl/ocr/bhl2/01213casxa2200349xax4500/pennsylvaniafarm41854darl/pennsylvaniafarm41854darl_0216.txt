THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[j0tY 

On the 22(1 of April, we published a communication from 
 G. Emersojj, Esq., of Philadelphia, controverting the posi- 
 tions of this article. AVe have delayed a reply to Mr. Emeh- 
 so.N for the purpose of collecting fa<ts, which would enable 
 us to place the subject before our readers iu a proper 
 light. 

The main point in Mr. Emerson's communication is, that 
 the sweet-scented vernal grass furnishes "the proximate 
 cause of the delightful flavor for.wliich the butter in the 
 Philadelphia and many Europeau markets is distinguished." 
 It is of importance to the public to l<uow whether this as- 
 sumption is founded in truth or not. The most certain mode 
 of settling the question would bo to feed a cow for a given 
 time wholly on the sweet-scented vernal grass, and an equal 
 time on other species, and compare the butter, as to quality, 
 produced by each. This might be considered demonstrative 
 evidence, but as it is not attainable we must take the best 
 within our reach. 

First then, let us examine the case on the principle that 
 like causes produce like effects. To avoid collateral ques- 
 tions, it will be conceded that Mr. Emerson and others are 
 correct in the opinion that no butter in the United States 
 possesses the "e-\quisito flavor of Philadelphia butter." Mr. 
 Emeuson says he has discovered that this superiority is 
 caused by the cows feeding on the sweet-scented vernal 
 gTass. What are the grounds for this conclusion ? Does 
 the grass alluded to grow more in the neighborhood of Phil- 
 adelphia than elsewhere ? We have examined the pastures 
 of many of the most celebrated grazing districts of this 
 country, and iu none of them is this grass more abundant 
 than it is in the vicinity of Boston, though it is common in 
 other parts of New England, and in New York. If it is the 
 cause of the goodness of the butter in one place, it should 
 produce the same effect in other places where it must be eat- 
 en to the same or a greater extent. This argument of itself 
 sufficient to prove either that the idea of the superiority of 
 Philadelphia butter must be abandoned, or that the excel- 
 lence of the article cannot be caused by the sweet-scented 
 vernal grass. 

As to the chemical question involved in Mr. Emerson's com- 
 munication — that the sweet-scented vernal grass yields ben- 
 zoic acid on analysis — it cannot affect the point at issue, un- 
 til it is shown (which has not yet been done) that this acid 
 actually produces the peculiar sweetness and flavor of the 
 butter. 

The next point which demands attention is the compara- 
 tive value of this grass. What better rule can be had as to 
 this, than the estimation in which the grass is regarded by 
 animals? Their instincts are unerring in regard to the se- 
 lection of food best fitted for nourishment, and their prefer- 
 ences afford a safer guide to the farmer than any hypothesis 
 opposed to this self evident principle. 

Wo said that cows are not fond of the sweet-scented ver- 
 nal grass — that they prefer many other kinds. This state- 
 ment was made from personal observation. To show that 
 our ideas in this particular, as well as in regard to the com- ' 
 parative value of the grass, agree with the best authorities, 
 we invite attention to the following extracts : 

Loudon says of this grass — "It is chiefly valuable as an 
 early grass ; for though it is eaten by stock, it does not ap- 
 pear to be much relished by thom." — (Jgclopedia of Agricid- 
 tnre. 

The Comjilete Grazier says — "Mr. Swayne thinks it of 
 little consequence, as it is neither very productive to the 
 farmer, nor relished by cattle. It is certain that cattle will 
 not eat it while the}' can get at other grasses." 

Sinclair, in his account of the AVoburn experiments on 
 grasses, regards the sweet-scented vernal as entitled to a 
 place in the composition of all permanent pastures but says: 
 "The chief property that gives merit to this grass is its early 
 growth, though in this respect it is inferior to several other 
 species which are later in flowering. It thrives best when 
 combined with ir.any different species, and is, therefore, a 
 true permanent pasture grass. It does not appear to be par- 
 ticularly liked by cattle, though eaten in pasture? in common 
 with others. Mr. Grant, of Leighton, laid down a field of 
 considerable extent; one-half of which was sown with this 
 grass and white clover, the other half with meadow fox-tail 
 and red clover. The sheep would not touch the sweet-scent- 
 ed vernal and white clover, but kept constantly on the fox- 
 tail grass, though the dwarfish nature of the sweet-scented 
 vernal had occasioned an unusual degree of luxuriance of 
 the white clover with which it was combined. This would 
 indicate that it is not, when single or when combined with but 

two or three different species, very grateful to cattle. The 
 chemical examination of this nutritive matter, shows that it 
 does not abound in gacchariue matter, but chiefly in mucilage; 
 and the insoluble extract is in a greater proportion than in 
 many other grasses." 

Those persons who know with what avidity sheep usually 
 eat white clover, will readily understand why it was rejected 
 in the above case. Mr. Emerson says the sweet-scented 
 vernal grass is "capable of communicating a delightful fla- 
 vor to the meat of sheep and other stock." It is evident 
 that in Mr. Grant's experiment, the sheep had no desire to 
 "flavor" their meat with this grass. 

We come now to American authorities. The late Judge 
 BuEJL, of Albany, writing to the American Farmer on the 
 subject of grasses, regards the sweet-scented vernal as val- 
 uable in pastures on account of its affording early feed, <tc., 
 but says — "it is of diminutive growth, and is not worth cul- 
 tivating for hay." 

Dr. Darlington says — "This grass has been much noticed 
 in Europe as a fragrant meadow grass, but it seems rather 
 to belong to a moist, cold, thin soil, — and is by no means re- 
 garded in the United States as a grass of superior value." — 
 Agricultural Botany. 

In a letter wo have lately received from the author last 
 quoted, he says — "You will perceive that I do not estimate 
 the Anthoxanthum very highly. I consider it much inferior 
 to Phleum (timothy or herds-grass), Poa pratcnuis (Ken- 
 tucky blue grass, or June grass), Dactylis (cocks-foot, or or- 
 chard grass), or even Lolium perenne (rye grass), — either for 
 hay or pasture." 

Dr. Darlington's residence is West Chester, Pa., the cen- 
 tre of a district which produces some of the most celebrated 
 "Philadelphia butter." His superior knowledge of grasses, 
 both botanically and agriculturally, is well known. 

As to the Poa p>ratensis, all writers assign it a very high 
 place lor its nutritive properties, and its value as a pasture 
 grass. Mr. Emerson says he never heard this grass called 
 "June grass," and could find no one around Philadelphia 
 who knew it by that name — it being there known as "green 
 grass." How strange! But if Mr. Emerson should inquire 
 in the vicinity of Boston for "green grass," he might be 
 equally surprised to find that few people here know any such 
 grass ! Does he not know that the common or vulgar names 
 of plants vary in different neighborhoods? 

Mr. Emerson claims to have been "the first who pointed 
 out the sweet-scented vernal grass" as the cause of the su- 
 perior quality of the Philadelphia butter. Wo trust no one 
 will attempt to deprive him of the honor of the supi)Osed 
 discovery ! 

Bobberies Among Bees. 

As I cannot give all the details relative to bees robbing, I 
 will venture a few hints, without all the reasons which dic- 
 tate them. Bee-keepers, not understanding their business, 
 are liable to considerable losses. Piobberies are more fre- 
 quent in spring than at other seasons ; yet bees will often bo 
 trespassing at any time in warm weather when honey is 
 scarce in the flowers. One of the greatest diifieulties is the 
 fact that but very few persons can tell when bees are being 
 robbed; it is the most difficult of any thing about the apiary. 
 Repeated, close and patient observation alone can decide at 
 the commencement. It is generally supposed that whenever 
 the bees are outside the hive fighting, that they are also rob- 
 bing, usually; instead of this being the case, it indicates a 
 strong colony, and a disposition to defend themselves 
 against all intruders. Strong families are in but little dan- 
 ger. I never knew a successful attack on such a stock at 
 the commencement. A weak hive or refuse honey must first 
 get up an appetite for pillage before any serious result will 
 follow. It being much easier to prevent a commencement 
 than to arrest it afterwards, it seems necessary to know the 
 real condition of all stocks, especially in the spring. Some 
 cool morning, raise the hive till all the bees belonging to it 
 may be seen — take a thorough view, even if the hive is to be 
 turned bottom up; if the clusters bo large, extending 
 through nearly all the comb, not much danger need be ap- 
 prehended; but should it be small, some care will be requis- 
 ite. Strong stocks will bo quite sure to find out weak ones, 
 and carry off their stores. To prevent which, as far as prac- 
 ticable, close the entrance, leaving only room for one bee to 
 pass at a time. Should an attempt be made, they will be 
 able to repel it much easier than if several could enter at 
 once. AVithout this precaution, (and sometimes with it,) in
