extensive apiaries, very soon after a weak stock is discovor- 
 ed by its more powerful neighbor, the hurry and hustle at- 
 tending the removal of the spoil is discovered by others, who 
 will join in the plunder. Perhaps a dozen or more will bo 
 engaged in half an hour. Hence the necessity of knowing 
 which the we.ak stocks are, to give them this advantage. It 
 is a bad practice to allow too much room for egress, even to 
 moderately strong families. 

We will now eudeavor to point out some of the indications 
 of robbing, as even these precautions may not always pre- 
 vent an attack, although it is usually all-sufficient. Now, 
 instead of interfering with a stock (farther than a contrac- 
 tion of the entrance) that has already set up a defiance by 
 combatting with their assailants, and will nine times in ten 
 need no assistance, our attention should be given to the 
 weak ones tuat may be plundered entirely without the least 
 show of resistance. The first thing to be noticed will be an 
 unusual number of bees apparently at work — and yet it may 
 be the young bees that take a turn of exercise a little after 
 the middle of every fair day; their motions when leaving 
 the hive are so nearly the same as robbers, that an experi- 
 enced eye alone can tell which it is ; but this bustle of young 
 bees will not last over an hour. When the hive assumes its 
 usual quietness, visit it again, and if you find the commo- 
 tion increased, it is time to interfere by closing the hive at 
 once. You can then let them out towards night, for the 
 robbers to return home ; or, if there are enough to about 
 equal those belonging to the stock, you may retain them as 
 prisoners, and compel them to join the weak hive. All that 
 appears necessary is to confine them two or three days; they 
 forget home, and add considerable strength to the family. 
 If too few are enclosed, they are killed. 

All pillaging commences on our first real warm, pleasant 
 day — seldom otherwise. If your bees have been neglected 
 through the day, visit them after sunset of such days ; rob- 
 bers will work long after honest laborers are at home. To 
 break up the habit, it is probably the least trouble to close 
 the hive with some contrivance to admit a little air, and 
 take them to some cool, dark place, until at least two or 
 three warm days have passed, and the robbers cease to look 
 for it, when it may be returned to the old stand — they will 
 be uneasy and try to bite their way out when left out doors. 
 This remedy is preferable to many others, such as breaking 
 the comb, &c. Removing the hive to some other stjind after 
 the bees have marked the location, is a ruinous practice, un- 
 less taken a mile or more. Where but one stock is engaged, 
 by changing the stand with the weak one, as has been re- 
 commended, will often have a good effect, but where a num- 
 ber are engaged, which is nearly always the case, it is abso- 
 lutely impracticable. Spring is the only time that we are 
 excusable for letting our bees remain weak enough to be 
 plundered; it is then that they should all form steady, in- 
 dustrious habits, but, like man, when strong enough to take 
 by force what is not their own, and the habit of living on 
 the labor of others once established, it is seldom thoroughly 
 eradicated, or honest labor relished afterwards. — Country

Is the First Milk Poison? 

A friend informs us that Mr. H. B. Wyman, of Sidney, lost 
 a valuable sow not long ago, in consequence of giving her 
 the first milk of a cow after calving, and asks if it inv.iriably 
 causes such trouble if hogs are fed on it. We bcleive that 
 it does. We one year gave such milk to <a sow that was 
 with pig. It made her sick and she cast her pigs before 
 her time all of which were dead. We were told that such would 
 be the result if we fed her with it, but were faithless. 
 The next year we fed it to another under the same circum- 
 st.'inco and the result was the same — all the pigs were dead, i 
 We found that rather costly experimenting, and have never 
 tried it again. Last spring one of <pjir neighbors who had a 
 very fine sow, fed her with a pretty generous portion of such 
 inilk, she imraodiatoly became sick and came very near i 
 dying. 

And now wo have the above fact related of Mr. Wyman's 
 sow as above. 

Wo think these experiments suflScent to warrant the con- 
 clusion, that such milk is highly injurious to swine, or at 
 least to sows. It would be rather expensive to go into a 
 series of experiments, to prove that such food is invnriably 
 injurious to swine, but when insolatcd .and accidentJil cases 
 are followed by the same result, it is fair to consider it an es- 
 tablished law of natnre, and worthy to be put down among 
 the scientific facts iu animal physiology. — Maine Farmer. 

Slimy Slug. — (Selaudria Cerasi.) 
 This insect is extensively known to pomologists as an in- 
 veterate enemy to the pear tree. It frequently makes its 
 appearance all at once, and in such numbers as well nigh to 
 bafiie the most energetic efforts to destroy or arrest them. 
 They commence depredations, generally, on the upper sur- 
 face of the leaves, eating out and entirely destroying tho 
 soft sapid substance forming the connections between tho 
 ribs, leaving each loaf upon which they locate and prey, in 
 appearance, like a sieve bottom, or a piece of loosely fabri- 
 cated gauze. Their physiological appearance bears no si- 
 militude to that of the canker-worm, being shaped nearly 
 like a tad-pole. Their color is dun, sometimes quite dark, 
 and their length is from an eighth to half an inch, but rare- 
 ly' more. 

l)ow.\ix« speaks of this insect in his work on the "Fruits 
 and Fruit Trees of America," page .^28 ; and it is also men- 
 tioned by KiiNniciv, in his ''Orchardist," page 55. Both of 
 these authors recommend similar means for its destruction, 
 and to them, all who are interested are respectfully refer- 
 red. 

A writer in an eastern paper, i-emarking upon the Selau- 
 dria Cerani, by which his pear trees h.ad been greatly in- 
 jured, says : — "'I bought, a month since, a garden syringe, 
 also a keg of whale oil soap, for seventj'-five cents, and with 
 these two articles of trifling cost, have destroyed thousands 
 of flies, slugs, and worms, which infest jilum trees, hop, 
 melon and other vines. Tho soap will make even a full 
 grown caterpillar wink, and derange his appetite efiectual- 

ly." 

Another cheap and effectual method of destroying the 
 "slug" is given by tho same writer, as follows : — "Take a 
 piece of very coarse cotton cloth, say twentj"^ inches square, 
 and tie up the corners of it. enclosing one or two cjuarts of 
 air-slacked lime, or unleaehed ashes therein, and make it 
 secure to tho end of a long, light pole. In the morning, 
 while the dew is on, elevato the suck above the topmost 
 branches of the tree, striking the end of the pole with a 
 small mallet occasionally, and moving the pole or sack about 
 till ever^y leaf is finely dusted over with the lime or ashes. 
 This operation need not be rope.ated, if once thoroughly per- 
 formed. The time requisite for a full grown tree is not over 
 five minutes. Pear trees should be scraped, both tops and 
 trunks, in May or June, and washed witli a mixture of soft 
 soap, lime, and green cow manure, put on with a brusli, as a 
 very thick wash. Have a quart or two of iron scales or 
 cinders broken fine around each tree. It keeps them healthy 
 and prevents blight. Washing the trunks and larger 
 branches with strong soap suds, is another remedy highly 
 spoken of." 

The above recommendations are all well enough in judi- 
 cious hands ; but great care must be used in Hcrapln'j — rub- 
 bing is a better term — and in the use of lime. Old plaster 
 from the walls of houses, broken fine, and mixed with pul- 
 verised charcoal, lione dust, guano and gypsum, should also 
 be placed around the roots, and incorporated thoroughly 
 with the soil. 

There are few departments of farming which more liber- 
 ally remunerate the farmer thiin fruit-growing. Our mar- 
 kets are but imperfectly supplied with many kinds of fruit, 
 which are consequentlj' in great demand, and at high 
 prices. 

There is a small "slug" which frequently proves destruc- 
 tive or highly injurious to the clover plant in its earliest 
 stages of development, and which is easily destroyed by 
 lime. A very slight dressing is said to be sufficient. It is a 
 fact, generally well known to agriculturists of intelligence, 
 that a very slight dressing of this mineral will, on light 
 soils, bring in clover, a grass that makes a fine crop of val- 
 uable hay, with but verj' sliglit impoverishment to the soil. 
 It has also been asserted that its alkaline properties are 
 effectual in destroying the fumjus or mosses which often 
 gather on the stems and branches of tho trees. Look after 
 tho slugs in season. — N. E. Farmer. 

Farmers, Look to Your Forests. 

The forests of Western Xew York, and indeed of all the 
 Western States are disappearing like the morning mist from 
 the hills. The increased rapidity of this destruction is 
 hardly manifest, because the landmarks of the forest disap- 
 pear after a few years, and give place to fertile fields. 

Prominent among the enemies of the forest (although it 
 must bo admitted a friend to humanity) is the railroad. The
