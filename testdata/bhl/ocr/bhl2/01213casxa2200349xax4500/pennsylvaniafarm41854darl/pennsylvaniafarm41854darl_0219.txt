An important fact w.as brought to light in regard to the 
 draft of the Double Plow, when compared with a single two- 
 horse plow; and settles the question as to whether it is an 
 implement that can be propelled by two horses or not. 

All the plows entered proved themselves capable of doing 
 excellent work — such as any farmer might profitably pattern 
 after ; but in view of the facts briefly named above, the 
 Committee unhesitatingly pronounce the Michigan Double 
 Plow the best plow, for all purposes, on the ground.

Varieties of the Currant. 

Among the smaller fruits, the currant is entitled to pre- 
 ominenee for its intrinsic usefulness. It will grow on almost 
 any soil, bears without fail every year, and yields a large 
 crop. It is a palatable and wholesome fruit, which comes at 
 a season when others are comparatively scarce, and contin- 
 ues a long time. Its value for jellies is known to every 
 housewife. It affords a good wine at little cost. The black 
 currant possesses a value for the production of a medicinal 
 wine, winch is not appreciated. A gentleman in this state 
 formerly made considerable quantities, which were exported 
 to the southern cities and the West India islands, where it 
 was much esteemed for its efficacy in the prevention and 
 cure of summer complaints. 

Viewed in reference to all its good qualities, the currant is 
 not generally so highly prized as it ought to be. A late 
 number of the Ilvrtivwlturist contains an article by John 
 Saul, of Washington, D. C, which comprises much valuable 
 information in regard to this fruit, especially relating to the 
 characteristics of varieties. We copy the following from 
 Mr. Saul's communication, which may be of advantage to 
 our readers. — Boston Cultivator. 

1. Champagne. — -In foliage, wood, and habit, this belongs 
 to the Red class. Color delicate rosy-pink, and would ap- 
 pear like a cross between a Red and AV'hite, from the color 
 of the fruit; but wood, foliage, and growth, set it down at 
 once among the Reds. This variety is scarce in England. 
 The bunches are small, yet it is much in demand, where 
 known, for preserving. 

2. Red Dutch. — ''Dunchcs short. This is a sweet, rich, 
 and giiod Currant." Thus has it been described by Mr. 
 Rivers, in the last edition of his catalogue. When we con- 
 sider the many good qualities of the Red Dutch, it is a free 
 grower, a good Ijearer, a fair sized bunch, with large, high 
 colored, rich berries ; and above all, for jams and jellies it 
 has no superior, if it has an equal. It is one of the best 
 Red Currants. 

.3. Bed Dutch, Long-Bunched. — This a fine long-bunched, 
 large-berried variety of the above. It is later, and rather 
 more acid. 

4. Red Grape. — A very fine long-bunched variety with 
 large berries, but very acid. 

5. Knight'H Earbj Red. — -Bunches and berries about me- 
 dium size, moderately sweet. A very good early Currant. 

6. Knight's Large Red. — Bunches long, berries large, me- 
 dium season. A fine large Currant, but inclined to be acid. 

7. Knight's Sweet Red. — A rcalh' good, sweet. Rod Cur- 
 rant, with ling bunches and largo berries. 

8. Palmer's Large Red. — In this wo have a very fine, long 
 bunched, largo-berried Currant ; a vigorous grower and an 
 abundant bearer. It is extensively cultivated in some local- 
 iiios in England. 

9. Pitmaston Sweet Red. — Bunches short, with berries be- 
 low medium size. This i.s the sweetest of all the Red Cur- 
 rants. Raised by Mr. Williams, of Pitmaston. 

10. 17efori"a, Rabi/ or Houghton Cattle. — The bunches aro 
 longer than any other variety. A free grower and an abun- 
 dant bearer. Perhaps on the whole the finest Red Currant 
 known. 

11. lied Svriped Leaved. — A poorly variegated variety of 
 a bad Red Currant. Unworthy of culture, either for its fo- 
 liage or fruit. 

12. Black Bang-up. — A good variety of Black. Bunch 
 and berry nearly if not quite as large as Black Naples. 

13. Btarh A'«;)/e«.— Consi<lorcd the liest of the Black Cur- 
 rants, and I think deservedly so. Bunches of fair length. 
 Berries large. 

14. Xew Dwarf Black. — This variety promises well. It 
 is of more dwarf habit than the other Blacks, and in bunch 
 and borry equal to Black Napl.-s. 

15. Green Fruited Black. — Wood, foliage, and growth, is 
 that of the Black ; while the fruit when ripe is green. In 
 flavor it will not approach the other Blacks. It is a most 
 singular variety, but is worthless as a fruit-bearer. 

1(5. Variegated Leaved Blnck. — Here again we have a 
 badly variegated foliage, and a poor fruit. Not worth culti- 
 vating. 

17. Old White. — This variety now is seldom met with, the 
 larger varieties having taken its place. The bunches are 
 short; berries small, amber-colored or nearly so, and of 
 higher flavor than any of the other Whites. This should be 
 borne in mind by the raisers of new varieties. 

18. White Dutch. — -Bunches of fair length; berries largo, 
 deep in color, and of high flavor. This is a very fine varie- 
 ty ; every point considered, perhaps the finest of the White 
 Currants. 

19. White Grape. — Bunches long; berries large, pale, not 
 quite as high flavored as the White Dutch. As a general 
 rule, the closer a White Currant approaches in color to am- 
 ber, the sweeter and richer in flavor it is, like a finely ripen- 
 ed Muscat Grape. 

Some of tho finest Currants I have ever seen grov.-n were 
 in the Isle of Wright. In Guernsey and Jersey they grow 
 equally fine, more particularly the Reds and Whites. Tho 
 soil was a strong, adhesive loam, resting on clay, but a well 
 drained bottom. The climate is very genial, and the fruit is 
 not only large and well colored, but finely ripened. In tho 
 market gardens about London they are excellently grown 
 and managed somewhat in this way : They are planted in 
 lines at given distances apart — say twenty or thirty feet row 
 from row, and three or four feet apart in the rows. Tho 
 ground, which is naturally good, is highly manured, and 
 cropped between the vegetables. The phxnts, after tho first 
 year or two — when they commence bearing — are pruned 
 very hard. Perhaps it will be better understood what I 
 mean by h.ard, when I say the greater part of the young 
 wood is thinned out, and what is allowed to remain is short- 
 ened back to two or three inches. By this means the trees 
 are alwaps kept short, never attaining a greater height than 
 two or three feet. The bushes being low, with well-thinned 
 out and shortened branches, they shade little or none of the 
 ground, and are cropped up to the bush. These strong ma- 
 nured and well pruned trees produce magnificent fruit, and 
 in great abundance, well remunerating the market gardener 
 for his trouble. 

The Height of a Colt. 

Mr. James R. Martin, of Kingston, Kentucky, gives out 
 the following upon this point, which is certainly novel, and 
 perhaps it may be true: 

'■I can toll you how a man may know within half an inch, 
 the height a colt will attain when full grown. The rule may 
 not hold good in every instance, but nine out of ten it will. 
 When the colt gets to be three weeks old, or as soon as 
 it is perfectly straightened in its limbs, measure from the 
 edge of the hoofs to the middle of first joint, and, for every 
 inch it will grow to the height of a hand or four Inches when 
 its growth is mature. Thus: if this distance bo found sis- 
 teen inches, it will make a horse sixteen hands high. By 
 thi> means a man may know something what sort of a horse, 
 with proper care, ho is to expect from his colt. Three 
 years ago I bought two very shabby looking colts for twen. 
 ty dollars each, and sold them recently for three hundred 

dollars. So much for knowledge how to guess at a colt."

The Cashmere Goat. 
 The editor of the Farmer and Planter says: This goat, which 
 has recently been introduced into the United States from 
 Turkey, by Dr. Davis ofS. C, is of larger size than cur com- 
 mon goat, is as easily kept and by this experiment is proven to 
 be admirably adapted to ourclniate. Its great exccllenco is, 
 that instead of a coat of hair, it has a fleece of fine silky appear- 
 ance, from 4 to inches long in one year's growth. It is 
 from the fleece of this goat tho celebrated Cashmere shawls 
 from China are maile. Besides it:* beautiful silky api>e!irance, 
 textures made from the fleece of this goat outwear all known 
 substances. Stocks made of it have been worn six winters 
 without material injury. They can be shorn annnaliy, and 
 the average weight of each fleece is about 4 pounds, being in 
 v.alue to the united fleeces of li) Merino sheep annually. Dr. 
 Davis considers these so well adapted to the climate, and so 
 valuable that he refuses to sell full blood ewes at all, but sells 
 the bucks from $100 to $200 each. He is liberal, however, 
 and has given several to friends.
