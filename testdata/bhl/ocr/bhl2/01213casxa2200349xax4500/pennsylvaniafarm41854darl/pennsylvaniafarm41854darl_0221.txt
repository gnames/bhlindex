DESCRIPTION OF PIGGERY. 

Figure 1 represents a front perspective view of the 
 whole building and pigyard. The building is 125 feet 
 long by 14 wide, with open or outer pens in the rear, in 
 the second story, opening into a yard. It is of two 
 stories, with glass windows to each pen, fronting the 
 south, and is constructed on the south side of a hill, the 
 lower story being built on an excavation made for that 
 purpose, whereby the pens in that story (which are 
 In-eeding pens for winter or early spring pigs,) are pro- 
 tected from the cold northerly winds, and a suitable tem- 
 perature maintained in them for breeding in the winter 
 when desired, without the use of artificial heat, by the 
 rays of the sun shining through the glass of the windows.

there will be found to be sufficient heat maintained for 
 breeding ; but, if the winter should be unusually severe, 
 artificial heat may be employed.

 yard behind. A arc the inner pens, and L the outer 
 yards, the latter are in the yard or enclosure Y. Lot Y 
 has a large shed to protect the manure, and communi- 
 cates with a stream of water. The pigs enter the outer 
 yards from the rear, and from thence to the inner pens, 
 and, if desired, can be secured there by sliding doors 
 which are provided to each pen, though not represented 
 in the drawings. The passage B is four feet wide, and 
 extends the whole length of the building. This inter- 
 sects the entrance at the rear of the building, and serves 
 as a convenient moans of attending to the pigs, feeding,
