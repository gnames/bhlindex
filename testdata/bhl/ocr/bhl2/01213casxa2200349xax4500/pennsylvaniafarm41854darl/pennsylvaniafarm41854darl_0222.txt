cleaning the pens, &c. E is the swill room, which is 16 
 feet long, in which is contained a furnace and boiler, a 
 swill tub G, or reservoir into which the boiled provender 
 is placed, a scries of bins K, which are for holding dif- 
 ferent kinds of grain, and a place for firewood. Cut 
 through the floor of the swill room is a hatchway M, 
 which is for emptying the swill from the reservoir or 
 boilers to another reservoir in the lower story, where it 
 will be convenient for feeding the breeding sows below. 
 S denotes stairway conmuinicating with the upper and 
 lower story. D, D, end doors to enter passage B, B, 
 B. 

Fig. 3 is a plat view of the lower story, or breeding 
 pens. N are the pens which have no yai-d pens. And 
 the passage B, B, B, extends the whole length of the 
 building at the rear side, instead of at the front side, as 
 in tlie upper story, so that the pigs get the full benefit 
 of the rays of tlie sun through the windows. Those 
 lower pens are entered at the doors A, A, from the front 
 and through the passage B, B, at each end of the build- 
 ing, the pigs entering through either of these doors, pass 
 into the long passage B, and enter the pens through 
 doors at the rear. S represents the stairs below, aside 
 of which is the reservoir to receive food from the trap 
 door M. 

Fig. 4r, a vertical cross section of the building. A are 
 the upper pens, and L the outer yards. N, the lower or 
 breeding pens. The floors of both stories slope so as to 
 drain off the .surplus liquid, and render the stalls or pens 
 more easy to be cleansed. These slope in opposite di- 
 rections ; the lower one to the front, and the upper one 
 to the rear of the building, as represented in Fig. 4. I 
 is a reservoir located in front of the building, with suit- 
 able conducts leading from the building for draining the 
 lower or breeding pens. The upper pens are drained 
 from the rear side. 

perceived a greener hue in the leaves of my young trees; 
 in a week there was no mistaking the fact that an im- 
 provement had taken place, and now when the second 
 week has passed I have little doubt that I shall be able 
 to keep them alive. In adflition to covering the ground 
 with manure for some distance over 'the roots of the 
 trees, I also shaded the trunks as the few leaves were 
 inadequate to do it. I also, as the ground was dry, con- 
 tinued to water each tree, but less copiously than before 
 — putting on just enough to keep the manure well mois- 
 tened. Yours, &c., Y.

Mulching Trees. 

Mr. D.4ELINGT0N : — Permit me to thank you for the 
 article in your June number under the above title. I 
 believe it lias saved me a number of newly transplanted 
 trees. 

For several years I have been trying to raise some 
 choice fruit trees, as well as some shade trees, around 
 my dwelling, but whether I procured the latter from the 
 •woods or the nurseries they invariably died in June or 
 July. My fmit trees usually lived a little longer, but 
 eventually died also. I ought to have stated that in this 
 neighborhood, the red shale rock lies near the surface, 
 and we labor under increased difficulties in transplanting 
 on that account. But to proceed. Discouraged, but not 
 desponding, at my bad success, I set out about a dozen 
 plum, cherry and quince trees last March, and several 
 thrifty sugar maples and horse chesuuts a few weeks 
 earlier. They all opened finely, and showed signs of 
 growth until about the beginning of this montli, when 
 the hot weather seemed to dry up the leaves, shrivel the 
 bark of the twigs, and in a few days they gave unmis- 
 takeable signs of decay. One of my neighbors, on hear- 
 ing me express my regret at the expected loss, told me 
 that he had observed an article in the Farm Journal on 
 the subject. He kindly lent me the Journal, and I set 
 about following its directions. In less than three days I 

Quackery in Agriculture. 

]Mr. Darlington : — In my intercourse among my fel- 
 low farmers, I often hear them denounce "book fann- 
 ing" in no measured terms ; esteeming the suggestions 
 and information contained in agricultural works as a 
 kind of farm quackery, never to be read, much less to 
 be followed. My experience has taught me that al- 
 though there are questionable aiticles admitted into even 
 the best of our publications, I scarcely take up one of 
 what I esteem the poorest class — the theoretical Jour- 
 nals — that I do not find to contain some valuable hint. 
 But is "quackery" in farming confined to agricultural 
 works and their readers? I believe not, as certainly as I 
 believe humbugs are not confined to agriculture. Eveiy 
 profession connected with animal or vegetable life con- 
 tains its quacks. They seem as extensive as humanity 
 itself. Almost every newspaper contains flaring adver- 
 tisements of medical quacks, while every county town 
 has a Water-Curc, a Thompsonian, a Homeopathic, or a 
 Witch Doctor, to say nothing of the number of half ed- 
 ucated but legitimate sons of Esculapius himself. Pre- 
 valent as is medical quackery, it cannot equal in number 
 the quacks in agriculture. How many thousands are 
 there in this State who "plant and sow" by the signs of 
 the moon ? And how many more are there whose sys- 
 tem of culture is as fatal to the soil, and to their own 
 pockets, as the deadly nostrums of the would-be-doctors 
 to the human subject ? I take it that any farmer is an 
 agricultural quack who undertakes to give advice, or 
 practice that about which he knows nothing, whether it 
 be in in following some untried, hair-splitting theory, or 
 absui-d superstition. 

The science of chemistry is doing much for agricul- 
 ture, the practical observations of practical farmers are 
 doing more, but publications which contain the informa- 
 tion aiforded by practical chemists, and the experience of 
 the best practical farmers, are of still greater benefit, as 
 they lay the information thus collected before thou- 
 sands, which otherwise woiUd be limited to small locali- 
 ties. 

Farmers, as well as others, have yet to learn much, 
 and I can conceive no better way for them to acquire a 
 thorough knowledge of their business than to observe 
 the practice of others, and contrast it with their own ; 
 to discard what is not advantageous, but to adopt what 
 is preferable to their own mode of procedure : and, as 
 few of us have the opportunity of personal observation 
 to much extent, to subscribe for agricultural publica- 
 tions that contain the experience of the most successful 
 farmers of the country. H. B. S.
