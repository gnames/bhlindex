selves around a pole twelve or fifteen feet high, and be- 
 fore the vine reaches the top of the pole, some beans are 
 already of a size to be pulled near its bottom. Lima 
 beans should be pinched off when 5^ feet high, and they 
 will readily throw out side shoots well filled with pods, 
 which will ripen before frost ; whereas, when not shor- 
 tened iu, the beans on the upper ends of the vine cannot 
 perfect themselves in time to be saved. It is unfair to 
 expect a gill of sap to travel through forty feet of vine 
 wrapped around a pole, and make a perfect bean at the 
 extreme end of it. The immense amount of imperfect 
 and half formed vine through which it has to travel, 
 causes too great an evaporation of moisture before arri- 
 ving at its point of destination. The Lima bean with 
 us is an exotic, and its behavior during growth is very 
 different from its habit Avhere native, and therefore the 
 mode of cultivation, as with the tomato, peach, &c., 
 must compensate for these differences.

 Lime in Agriculture. 

Mr. Editor : — Some years ago while listening to an 
 address delivered by Mr. Rankine, he stated that of all 
 the mineral substances that have been employed to im- 
 prove the soil, lime is the most important. All our lands 
 seem to be susceptible of great benefit from it ; and in 
 some parts of this district, more especially in Chester 
 countj', it can be obtained on such terms as to create a 
 probability that it may be profitably applied. The the- 
 ory of its modes of action involves chemical principles, 
 which it would be beyond my limits to attempt to ex- 
 plain. I may briefly state, however, a few facts con- 
 nected with its various effects. 

As stated by Mr. Rankine, it renders stiff and tena- 
 cious soils more pliable, and light and sandy soils moire 
 retentive of moisture. It decomposes all vegetable mat- 
 ter In the soil so as to supply the nourishment of living 
 plants, and it makes the nutritive matter itself more sa- 
 lubrious. These last effects may be seen in familiar in- 
 stances. If a little quick lime be added to a heap of 
 leaves or rotten wood, it is soon reduced to black mould; 
 and if a little be sprinkled on the rank spots, which get 
 up in pasture fields and are rejected by cattle, they will 
 will shortly be eaten down. It is not more active in 
 rendering the vegetable matter of the soil available than 
 it is in giving vigor to the plants and excellence of qual- 
 ity to the grain, and on no grain are its effects so re- 
 markable as on wheat. A farmer who having a great 
 command of manure, thought that he might dispense with 
 lime. He raised by measure, it is said, as many bush- 
 els of wheat on the acre as his neighbor, but it was 
 coarser in quality and therefore lighter, and in the mar- 
 kets great discrimination of price was made on account 
 of quality; so that he lost in two ways. He had at 
 last recourse to lime, and of course with complete suc- 
 cess. 

In cold and humid climates it is not considered that 
 old turfy lands can be profitably broken up without lime. 
 The straw will be abundant, but the grain light and un- 
 matured, but if treated with lime these lands are the 
 most productive. In our climate the vegetable matter 
 has not such a tendency to become peaty and inert, and 
 lime may not, to such a degree, be necessary for the pur- 

pose of promoting decomposition ; but it would in evei-y 
 case make our wheat of better quality. In cur best 
 lands it woidd give health and vigor to the straw and 
 render it less obnoxious to the diseases to which luxu- 
 riance is exposed, and it would make lands, at present 
 too rich for bearing grain, capable of producing healthy 
 and productive crops. From what has been said, it will 
 follow that it would be improper to apply lime to im- 
 poverished land, unless at the same time accompanied 
 with manure, without which it would aid in the robbery 
 of the soil. For other reasons it should not be applied 
 to wet land. 

In calculating the expense of liming, the permannncy 
 of its effects should be taken into account. If a proper 
 dose be administered there will be do need of a repeti- 
 tion of it for fifteen or twenty years. What the dose 
 should be must depend on the quality of the land, but, 
 generally speaking, it should be increased as the land is 
 more adhesive, or as it is more filled with vegetable mat- 
 ter. There are not many soils, probably, that would be 
 benefitted by less than 100 bushels to the acre. The 
 lime may be allowed to lie till it falls down into a state 
 of flour, and then be spread out when the soil has been 
 previously well pulverized. J. S. G.

Guenon's System. 

Me. Editor : — The sweeping denunciation of Mr. 
 GowEN, declaring Guenon's .system "foolish," induces 
 me to address him once more. Some years ago, I recol- 
 lect, Mr. GowEN showed himself rather vehement in our 
 polemics through the "Farmers' Cabinet." I hope such 
 will not be the case in the present instance. Your Jour- 
 nal has so far shown a just liberality in allowing ih^ pro 
 and con to be fairly discusssed, and which, indeed, is the 
 only true means to sift out the true merits of any ques- 
 tion in controversy. 

I am a believer in Guenon's system, notwithstanding 
 such belief may consign me, in Mr. Gowen's estimation, 
 to the same "foolish" category with other advocates of 
 the doctrine. So far as I have studied Guenon, it en- 
 tii'ely corroborates my experience that tJiere is a supe- 
 rior class of cows which may be known hj peculiar marks. 
 These marks are not confined to any particular breed, 
 but may be found in every race of cows. Neither do 
 they appear to be hereditary, but will appear in inter- 
 mediate generations of the same stock — like a man of 
 genius springing up from an obscure corner, while per- 
 haps his posterity will not inherit a single ray of his in- 
 tellect. I have no belief that the superior qualities of a 
 good cow are concentrated in a Durham, a Hereford, an 
 Ayrshire, an Alderney or a Holstein, but that good and 
 bad cows are found among tkem as well as among others. 
 This is my individual belief, based upon experience, yet 
 I do not feel justified in calling gentlemen "foolish" who 
 believe in the superior quality of the above named races. 
 Mr. GowEN himself can throw light upon tliis point 
 Some twelve or more years ago he imported the famous 
 cow "Dairy Maid." He can tell, perhaps, whether all 
 her posterity have inherited the extraordinary qualities 
 of that celebrated cow.
