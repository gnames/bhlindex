Paper from Wood. 

The great demand for paper outruns the supply of rags, 
 even adding those that are imported for the manufacture of 
 this article. The books say that a paper can be prepared 
 from the wood of various trees, but except from two sources 
 in England and one in France, and they not producing a 
 good article, it has not even beeu done unjil now. We are 
 on the eve of successfully producing such. We have speci- 
 mens of good writing paper — not as good as the best, for the 
 means of working up the material are not what they will be 
 — made of the fibres of hickory or the cotton poplar, of 
 white pine and cane-brake. The material is cut first of a 
 proper length, then treated alternately with diluted acids 
 and alkalies, washed, broken between rollers, bleached, and 
 thus prepared to be worked up. If under the microscope the 
 '•ultimate fibres" appear broken, as sometimes happens from 
 using too great mechanical violence, or if they are made too 
 tender by too great strength of acid or alkali, the specimen 
 is faulty. These processes are mostly in the hands of prac- 
 tical unscientific men. The assistance of a practical scien- 
 tific man at the mills would save much time, expense, and 
 the mortification of experimenting to discover facts already 
 well known to science. Indeed the struggles of successful 
 inventors would be much lessened in number and in their 
 melancholy results, if inventors would study the general 
 features of the sciences in whose details they are generally 
 the most skilled. — [Proceedings of Scientific Association at

Breaking Horses. 

" What is the best loay to break Hot'sea?" — I consider this 
 an important question, and as much overlooked, perhaps, as 
 any thing relating to rearing and fitting horses for service. 
 A well-broken horse is what every man wishes for, and will 
 command a readier sale, although he may be somewhat in- 
 ferior in other respects. Such a horse can only be depended 
 on. When I speak of a well-broken horse, I wish, to be un- 
 derstood one for farmers' use ; and such a horse, I believe, 
 will answer all purposes that a horse is used for. I shall 
 only speak of breaking to harness. I will simply say that 
 my opinion is, a colt should not be used under the saddle 
 until it is at least four j'ears old. I think breaking to har- 
 ness should commence at three j'ears, but never put to hard 
 work till six years old. In order to break a colt as he 
 should be, it is of great importance to have a horse that is 
 qualified to break him; and, in order to make mj'self under- 
 stood it will be necessary to describe some of his qualifica- 
 tions. In the first place, he should be perfectly true and 
 kind. A horse that will bite a colt is unfit for the purpose. 
 He should be a good stepper, because this is indispensable 
 to a good traveller. The step is what tells in the journey. 
 There is many a good horse that can trot fast, and is at the 
 same time a poor traveller. When a good stepper is found, 
 it almost invariably follows that his other gaits are in pro- 
 portion, lie should also be well-broken to the word. Now, 
 I would put the colt in the stable, and put the harness gent- 
 ly on him, keeping the doors all shut, and let him stand in 
 the stable a few hours in each day for a few days, until he 
 gets used to the harnes.«, and occasionally lead him out of j 

doors to get him accustomed to it. After he gets over show- 
 ing fear of the harness, he should be placed beside the liorso 
 he is to bo driven with, and the two harnessed toj^ether. 
 Great care should be used not to frighten him. After get- 
 ting all ready, a person should take him by the head, and 
 another hold of the lines, with a whip, and begin to lead 
 him along. If he is disposed to run, hold him in gently ; 
 never jerk him in the mouth ; humor him in the bit until ho 
 gets used to it. After driving him round for an hour or 
 two, if he is not afniid, you may attach him to a wagon that 
 is not too heavy, and drive him on a walk, if possible; but 
 if he is disposed to trot, bring him to the walk as soon as 
 you can, and drive him on the gait, and if possible never let 
 him break the walk until he is learned to walk as fast as 
 he possibly can. Much may be done, iu the breaking of a 
 colt to increase his speed for a traveller. Driving him on a 
 walk will not worry him ; consequently, ho can be kept 
 longer in the harness than if he was driven fast. As soon 
 as he appears to get a little tired, unharness him carefully ; 
 see that every part of the harness is unloosed before you at- 
 tempt to take it off. His breast should be washed in cold 
 water. The next day he should be harnessed aud driven as 
 before, unless his breast shows symptoms of being galled, 
 which will be discovered by the hairs being wet under the 
 collar. He should never be harnessed when there is the 
 least appearance cf his breast being sore. Great care should 
 bo used in turning about, for fear the wagon-tongue may 
 strike him suddenly, and cause him to kick. After he has 
 been driven day after day, till he has become accustomed to 
 the harness and carriage, and learned to walk as fast as it is 
 possible for him to do, you may commence the trot, in which 
 he should be as thoroughlj- learned as to walk. It will not 
 do to drive him far at a time ; but drive him a little way, 
 and stop till he gets rested. It is as necessary to learn him 
 to stop and start as any thing else. After he gets thorough- 
 ly broken to the trot you may let him walk or trot occasion- 
 ally ; but be sure not to let him get both gaits mixed up to- 
 gether, which will spoil both. Make him understand his 
 business thoroughly, whatever it may be. You maj' now 
 commence drawing light loads with him, but be sure not to 
 put a heavier load behind him than the break-horse can 
 easily draw, and get your carriage in a position that will 
 start easily. Be sure to have your break-horse ready to 
 start when the word is given. In this way he should bo 
 trained till he thoroughly understands his business. Alw^ays 
 bear in mind that the gaits above described are of the ut- 
 most importance to the value of the horse ; and whether 
 driven to a loaded or light wagon, close attention should be 
 paid to his gaits till they are thoroughly understood by him. 
 Now, another kind of training will be necessary for the 
 farm. That requires another kiud of gait. I have always 
 found that the best kind of work to put a colt to at first was 
 to put him to harrowing plowed ground. This is work that 
 will soon make him leg-weary a little, and it will be easy to 
 bring the quick step to a slow one, which is always neces- 
 sary for plowing ; and whether for plowing, or dragging, or 
 whatever the work maybe that requires the horse to go slow, 
 he may bo trained to this gait without injuring his stop be- 
 fore the carriage. But let him thoroughly understand what 
 his business is, and in after-life he will never forget it, and 
 it will add to his value as long as he is able to work. In 
 driving on a walk the lines may be a little slack ; but ho 
 should always be taught when the line is drawn tight, to 
 start off free; and when the line slackens to come to a walk. 
 Great pains should bo taken to learn him the word to stop 
 or to start. " Whoa" should never be said to him unless it 
 is intended for him to stop. Those who are unaccustomed 
 to thorough breaking may say I am taking a great deal of
