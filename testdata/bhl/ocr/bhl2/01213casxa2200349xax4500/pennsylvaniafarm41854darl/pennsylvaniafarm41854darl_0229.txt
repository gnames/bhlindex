JOHN KRAUSER'S PATENT PORTABLE CIDER AND WINE MILL.— PATENTED AUGUST 30TH, 1853. 

Tlie annexed engraving represents the Mill, showing 
 all its principal parts and its peculiar advantages over 
 all other mills heretofore invented, being light and port- 
 Able, and performing the labor it is intended for in one- 
 fourth the time usually taken, and being easily worked 
 by two persons who can make from eight to ten barrels 
 of cider in one day. It can also be used as a Wine Mill, 
 being so constructed as to answer for both purposes. 
 Its simplicity of construction, durability of action, ef- 
 fectiveness in its operation, of reducing the whole fruit 
 with great rapidity to a fine pulp ; the powerful press 
 attached to the Mill, which is capable of performing a 
 pressure equal to ten tons, causing the last drop of juice 
 to flow from beneath its pressure. 

It is stated that from eight to ten barrels of cider can 
 he made by hand-power in a day, and by horse power, to 
 whicl^the construction of the mill is adapted, a much 
 larger quantity can be produced. 

For the manufacture of Wine, no mill was ever better 
 constructed for the purpose than the one above repre- 
 sented. Its action upon the Grape is such, that while 
 the skin is being thoroughly broken, and the grape re- 
 duced to pulp, the seeds remain uninjured.

 Seed Store, northeast corner of Seventh and Market 
 streets, are sole agents in Philadelphia. 

Work for the Month. 
 Farm. — In this latitude hay is generally made in the 
 latter part of June and the beginning of July, according 
 to the kind of grass cut, or the notions of the farmer as 
 to the policy of early or late cutting. The grain har- 
 vest commences usually within a few days after the first 
 of the month. In this, too, a diversity of opinion exists 
 as to the propriety of early or late cutting. Those who 
 have experimented on the subject, we believe, are unan- 
 imous in the opinion that grain cut before becoming 
 "dead ripe" is of greater weight, and will make better 
 flour than when left uncut until fully matured. The 
 rule appears to be to cut when the stalk becomes white 
 and begins to shrink just below the head, and when the 

grain, on being pressed between the thumb and finger, 
 has the consistency of dough. Corn and potatoes will 
 continue to require attention. It too frequently happens 
 that the hurry of the hay and grain harvests prevent 
 proper care for these crops during this important period. 
 The consequence is an increased crop of weeds and a di- 
 minutive yield of corn and potatoes. Nor do the conse- 
 quences end with the season, but increased labor will be 
 required in after years to exterminate the product of 
 seeds now suffered to ripen. Again we say, neglect not 
 your corn or potatoes at this critical season. The ruta 
 baga crop should be sown the first week of this month in 
 ground previously well pulverised. 

Fruit Orchard. — Dig and plow between strawbeny 
 rows to keep down weeds, and allow runners to take root 
 freely. Continue the pinching and summer pruning 
 process, thus regulating the number of fruit branches, 
 and controlling the shape of the tree. Cut out the su- 
 perfluous branches of grape vines, and pinch off the ends 
 of the fruit branches, to increase the size of the grapes. 
 Summer pruning has been too generally neglected. Com- 
 mon sense teaches us that the best plan to stop the 
 growth of branches is to pinch off the terminal bud at 
 the point required, and also superfluous shoots as soon 
 as they appear, instead of allowing them to grow into 
 limbs to be subsequently cut off after the waste of a use- 
 less growth. The art of fruit growing is to a great ex- 
 tent found in a proper knowledge of pruning. The 
 blight in pear trees should now be carefull}- looked for, 
 and when it makes its appearance the parts should be 
 immediately cut away. Budding of pears and plumg 
 may be pei'formed this month, at any time when the bark 
 separates freely from the wood. If the weather is dry, 
 and there is danger sap may stop flowing before the buds 
 are mature, cultivate and work the soil around the trees 
 to produce continued action of the sap vessels. Shake 
 or jar quickly plum trees every morning, and collect for 
 burning or feed to the hogs the fruit which fulls, con- 
 taining the eggs of the curculio. Were thi.s plan adopt- 
 ed by all cultivators, the ravages of the "little Turk" 
 would be sensibly diminished. Whenever practicable,
