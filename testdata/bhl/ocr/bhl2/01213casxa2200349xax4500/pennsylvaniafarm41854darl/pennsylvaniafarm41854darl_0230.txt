liogs and poultry should have the run of the fruit or- 
 chard, to eat up the fruit which falls prematurely. 

Vegetable Garden. — Attend to directions of last 
 month. Transplant during damp spells of weather, cab- 
 bages, cauliflower and celery, as before dii-ected. This 
 latter should first be pricked out of seed beds, and trans- 
 planted to a prepared piece of ground, before final re- 
 moval into trenches. Try salt for this crop. Sow en- 
 dive, small salading, summer radish, ruta baga seeds, 
 &c. Plant cucumber seed for pickles. At the last of 
 the month some spinach and lettuce may be sown for au- 
 tumn use. Cut off and dry for use, such herbs as come 
 into flower. Peas may be planted for fall crop, also 
 sugar corn for table use or marketing. The main turnip 
 crop should be planted in drills about the last of this, 
 and the beginning of next month. Gather all seeds as 
 they ripen, and hang them up in a di-y, airy place. Stir 
 and pulverize the ground thoroughly between all vegeta- 
 bles, to promote their growth, and keep down all weeds. 
 Sow plaster and ashes over hills of cucumbers, squash- 
 es, pumpkins, &c. Where plants requii-e water, it 
 should be done in the evening. 

Flowek Garden. — Attend to mowing grass plots, 
 hoeing and raking flower bed and walks. Tie up care- 
 fully the young shoots of running roses and other creep- 
 ers. Peg down verbenas and petunias as they continue 
 to grow. They will flower much better when tied up to 
 stakes. Tulips, hyacinths and bulbous roots generally 
 may be lifted this month. Supply their place with the 
 last sowing of annuals. As soon as the hybrid perpet- 
 ual roses are out of bloom prune the young shoots back 
 to within three or four buds of the old wood. It will 
 cause them to start growing again and produce bloom. 
 Cut the seed pod of all perpetual roses, as soon as they 
 have shed their bloom. 

Notice to County Societies in Pennsylvania. 

We have been furnished by Dr. Elwyn, President of 
 the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture, a 
 printed pamphlet copy of the minutes of that Society 
 from its first institution in 1785 to March, 1810. 

We understand it has been printed by Dr. Elwyn at 
 his own expense, and he intends a copy for every Coun- 
 ty Agricultural Society in Pennsylvania, which the Se- 
 cretaries or other authorised persons can obtain by call- 
 ing at his residence in Philadelphia, or if more convenient 
 at the agricultural warehouse of Paschall Morris & Co., 
 northeast corner of Seventh and Market streets, Phila- 
 delphia. It contains much interesting and valuable mat- 
 ter, and the Doctor is entitled to much credit for his 
 liberality in getting it up in the present form. 

It will be seen by a perusal of this volume that many 
 of those, whose active energies were devoted to further- 
 ing the science of agi'icultnre at the earlier period of the 
 Society's existence, have given place to others, who, if 
 we know them aright, lack neither the ability nor the 
 determination to sustain the reputation of their institu- 
 tion. 

ty, made a report at a meeting, and submitted plans for 
 buildings for the Society, which was adopted, and a com- 
 mittee appointed to procure materials for enclosing the 
 exhibition gi'ouud and erecting suitable buildings before 
 the next annual exhibition. 

From the spirit of determination exhibited we expect 
 to see the "Common" in its finest gala dress in October. 
 By the way we will here just request the committee to 
 leave a little nook for us, or one of us, upon which to 
 pitch our tent at the exhibition in October.
