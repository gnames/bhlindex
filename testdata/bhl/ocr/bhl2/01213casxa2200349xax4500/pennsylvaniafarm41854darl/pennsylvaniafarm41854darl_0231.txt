Crops for 1854. 

The wheat crop in Chester and acyoining counties 
 seems to promise now to be a very heavy one. It is, 
 however, considerably lodged. A wheat crop is never 
 safe till secured in the barn. We understand in several 
 counties of Western Pennsylvania, wheat has been great- 
 ly injuretl by the changeable winter, which has thrown 
 the roots out and destroyed the crop. Many fields have 
 been plowed up and buckwheat sown. 

The hay crop in Chester county, from the same cause, 
 it is thought will be much lighter than last year.

 of to all the privileges of a member until the next an- 
 nual Exhibition.

 tary's book, on or before Tuesday evening, the 2Gth; and 
 all articles and animals, except horses, must be brought

 that they may be suitably arranged for examination by 
 the Judges on Wednesday morning. Hovses will be re- 
 ceived early on Wednesday morning, but must be enter- 
 ed previously. 

The Executive Committee do not intend to assure any 
 exhibitor, who neglects these requirements, that his ar- 
 ticles can be passed upon by the Judges. While every 
 effort will be made to secure the examination and proper 
 notice of every artide on exhibition, justice to those who 

comply with the rules of the Society requires that they 
 shall, in all cases, first receive attentfbn.

Competition without the State. — The Pennsylvania 
 State Agricultural Society makes the field of competition 
 co-extensive with the United States, and cordially in- 
 vites the citizens of other States to compete with us for 
 our prizes. 

Animals and articles entered for exhibition will have 
 cards attached, with the number as entered at the busi- 
 ness office ; and it is desired that exhibitors should, in 
 all cases, obtain their cards of Number and Class, pre- 
 vious to placing their stock or articles on the grounds. 

All persons who intend to exhibit horses, cattle, sheep 
 or swine, or who intend to offer stock for sale, should 
 notify the Secretary of such intention, on or before the 
 20th day of September, and leave with him a list and 
 full description of such stock, in order that proper ar- 
 rangements may be made for their accommodation. 

Applicants for premiums are particularly requested to 
 pay attention to the directions attached to the list of 
 premiums for fat cattle, fat sheep, butter and cheese, 
 &c., and the statements required from exhibitors of those 
 articles must be lodged with the Secretary before the

Instructions for Judges and Superintendents. — 
 The Judges are requested to report themselves to the 
 President on their arrival, at the Business Office, at the 
 Show Grounds ; they are desired to meet at the Society's 
 tent, on the grounds, at 4 o'clock, P. M., on Tuesday, 
 26th September, when the vacancies will be filled ; and 
 on AVednesday morning, at 9 o'clock, at the same place, 
 they will be furnished with the books of entries, when 
 they will proceed to decide upon the merits of the differ- 
 ent animals and articles submitted to them, reference 
 being made to the numbers affixed to each. 

The Judges on all animals will have regard to the 
 symmetry, early maturity, size, and general qualities 
 characteristic of the breeds which they judge. They 
 will make due allowance for age, feeding, and other cir- 
 cumstances, on the character and condition of the ani- 
 mals. 

They will not give encouragement for over-fed animals. 
 They will not award premiums for bulls, cows, or heif- 
 ers, which appear to have been fattened for the butcher: 
 the object being to have superior animals of this kind for 
 breeding. 

No person whatever will be allowed to interfere with 
 the Judges during their adjudications. 

The Judges will be expected, in all cases, in making 
 their reports to give the reasons of their decision, (es- 
 pecially in the case of animals,) embracing the valuable 
 and desirable qualities of the animals or articles for 
 which premiums were awarded.
