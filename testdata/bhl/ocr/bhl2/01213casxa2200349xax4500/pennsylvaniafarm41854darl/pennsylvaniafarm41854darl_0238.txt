formation, that the ben sat for several days after her 
 own eggs were hatched, until the young Quails made 
 their appearance. 

The Partridge, on her part, has sometimes been em- 
 ployed to hatch the eggs of the common domestic hen. 
 A friend of mine, who himself made the experiment, in- 
 forms me, that of several hen's eggs which he substitu- 
 ted in place of those of the Partridge, she brought, out 
 the whole ; and that for several weeks he occasionally 
 surprised her in various parts of the plantation, with 
 her brood of chickens; on which occasions she exhibited 
 all that distressful alarm, and practised her usual ma- 
 nceuvres for their preservation. Even after they were 
 considerably grown, and larger than the Partridge her- 
 self, she continued to lead them about; but though their 
 notes, or call, were those of common chickens, their 
 manners had all the shyness, timidity and alarm of young 
 Partridges ; running with great rapidity, and squatting 
 iu the grass exactly in the manner of the Parti-idge. 
 Soon after this they disappeared, having probably been 
 destroyed by dogs, by the gun, or by birds of prey. 
 Whether the domestic fowl might not by this method be 
 very soon brought back to its original savage state, and 
 tliereby supply another additional subject for the amuse- 
 ment of the sportsman, will scarcely admit of a doubt. 
 But the experiment, in order to secure its success, would 
 require to be made in a quarter of the country less ex- 
 posed than ours to the ravages of guns, traps, dogs, and 
 the deep snows of winter, that the new tribe might have 
 full time to become completely naturalized, and well fix- 
 ed in all their native habits. 

Strawberries. 
 A writer in the Friends Review, thus describes his pro- 
 cess in producing fine stawberries : — I applied about once 
 a week, for tiree times, commencing when the green leaves 
 first began to start, and making the last application just 
 before the plants were iu full bloom, the following prepara- 
 tion — of nitrate of potash, of glauber salts, and sal soda, 
 each, one pound: of nitrate of amonia one quarter of a pound 
 — dissolved in thirty gallons of rain or river water. One- 
 third was applied at a time, and when the weather was dry 
 I applied clean soft water between the times of using tho 
 preparation, as the growth of the young leaves is so rapid 
 that unless well supplied with water the sun will scorch 
 them. I used a common watering pot and made the ap- 
 plications towards evening. Managed in this way there is 
 never any necessity of digging over the bed or setting it out 
 anew. Beds of ten years old are not only as good, but bet- 
 ter than those two or three years old. But you must bo 
 sure and keep the weeds out. 

The Springfield Cattle Show. 

The 25th, 26th and 2rth days of October next, have been 
 fixed by tho United States Agricultural Society for holding 
 its first Cattle Convention, in the City of Springfield, 
 Clark county, Ohio. Six thousand dollars will be distribu- 
 ted in premiums for tho best stock of tho various breeds of 
 Cattle subject to competition without territorial limit. 

The Executive Committee of the United States Agricultu- 
 ral Society have been careful to select a time that will not, 
 so far as they are aware, conflict with any of tho State Fairs 
 or other meetings of general interest ; and after due delib- 
 eration have selected this place as tho most eligible for hold- 
 ing tho Cattle Fair. Springfield is centrally located as re- 
 gards the cattle region ; it is most convenient of access by 

railroad from almost every point of the compass. The 
 means for accommodating, at very moderate charges, a 
 large number of persons, are ample. Private houses will be 
 opened for the reception of guests. There are also eighteen 
 cities and towns within reach by an hour's ride on the rail- 
 roads, on which extra trains will be placed to accommodate 
 such as wish to go elsewhere for lodgings. 

About twenty acres of ground have been enclosed, and 
 more than three hundred stalls will be prepared for the shel- 
 ter of cattle during the Convention. It is expected that 
 very liberal arrangements will be made by all the railroad 
 companies, both for the transportation of cattle and the 
 conveyance of cattle to and from the Fair.

Preparation of Flax. 

The following is the Report of the Committee of Arts and 
 Siences of the American Institute on Leavitt's Machinery 
 for the preparation of flax, of which a notice has already been 
 made in our columns. The Committee report: 

That they have examined the samples of flax in various 
 states of preparation, exhibited to them by. Dr. 0. S. Leavitt, 
 and have received from him full explanations of his processes 
 to perform them. In order that they might perform the duty 
 asigned to them more satisfactorily, they have invited Col. 
 John Tranert to aid them in their investigations and to 
 unite with them in their report. 

1. From the samples exhibited, it appears that by Dr, 
 Leavitt's process, ripe flax, after being stripped of the seed, 
 can be cleansed completely and prepared for manufacture 
 without being rotted. 

2. That from the flax in its earlier stages of preparation, 
 withoutrotting, rope, twine, and coarse fabricks, may be made 
 with a great saving of manual labor. 

3. That by further mechanical processes the gum, glutin, 
 and resin, may be chiefly regioved, and by the use of ma- 
 chinery in aid of the usual chemical processes, the flax may 
 be deprived entirely of its color and rendord fit for the man- 
 ufacture of fine linen — that thread exhibited to them, appa- 
 rently in consequence of the omission of the process of rot- 
 ting, and tho substitution of mechanical methods for much of 
 what has hitherto been perforned chemically, is stronger than 
 common linen thread. 

4. That the expensive and wasteful process of heckling is 
 entirely superseded by Dr. Leavitt's processes, and the pre- 
 pared material is delivered from the last of the cleansing 
 processes in rovings ready to be submitted to the usual 
 spinning machines. 

5. That the flax cleansed, bleached, and formed into rov- 
 ings, can, we believe, bo produced at a cost much less than 
 that of rotted and heckled flax unbleached, while tho inven- 
 tor claims and adduces satisfactory arguments to prove the 
 probability that flax, ready for spinning into white thread, 
 will not exceed good cotton in its cost. 

6. Dr.LEAViTT also claims that by a process of kyanizing, 
 applied during the preparation of flax and hemp, the cordage 
 made therefrom is rendered more durable and stronger, while 
 the surface of the yarn is rendered smoother. 

Admitted that the processes of Dr. Leanitt have no other 
 advantages than those which your committee can state to be 
 absolutely certain, your Committee are of opinion that 
 their result must be attended with very important conse- 
 quences, and will, if carried into operation on an extensive 
 scale' add much to the agricultural and manufacturing wealth 
 of the United Stutes. Jas. Renwick, Chairman.
