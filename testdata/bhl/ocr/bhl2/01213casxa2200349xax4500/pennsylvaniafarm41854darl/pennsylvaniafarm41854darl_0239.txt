 Experiments in Reclaiming Swamps. 

BY J. W. PROCTOK, BANTERS, MASS. 

Experiment No. 1 — hy S. Blaney, of Salem. 

The locus in quo, of this operation, is situate among the 
 sienite hills in the western part of the city. It contains one 
 and a half acres, extending 40 rods in length, and varj'ing 
 from five to ten rods in breadth — the borders irregular, with 
 here and there a ledge of rocks obtruding. Eight years ago, 
 it was so densely covered with a growth of alders and blue- 
 berries, as to bo almost impenetrable to man or beast ; espe- 
 cially at those seasons of the year when the water was on ; at 
 that time the bushes were cut, and it remained without cul- 
 ture or product until 1S52. Mr. B. then becoming the own- 
 er set about bringing it into use. 

His first operation was to cut a ditch through the centre, 
 down to the hard pan ; the mud from which was taken to the 
 upland for the purpose of compost. Subsequently five or six 
 cords of refuse animal matter, collected from his wool shop, 
 and a neighboring glue foctory, were mingled with this mud, 
 making a heap of about twenty cords. The roots of the 
 bushes, and the stumps of the early growth of j'ellow birch, 
 were eflfoctually removed. About two hundred cart loads of 
 gravelly loam, from the shores adjoining, wore carted on to 
 fill the holes and gullies. Then the sod was inverted by the 
 plow, to the depth of ten inches. The surface was then pul- 
 verized and evened as far as practicable, and the heap of com- 
 post applied. 

About the first of September, 1852, it was sown with grass 
 seed, herds grass and red top. The whole expense thus far 
 (all the labor having, been hired by Mr. B.) is estimated not 
 to exceed $50 per aere. No other fertilizing material was 
 applied. 

In July, 1853, at the first cutting, 4 tons 1,170 pounds of 
 bay were obtained, which sold on the ground for $18 per 
 ton. At a second cutting three tons more were obtained, of a 
 quality equally valuable; — making the entire produce, within 
 thirteen months of the time of seeding down, 7 tons 1,170 
 pounds, or more than five tons to the acre — paying for all 
 the labor and material applied, and leaving a surplus of 
 SoO per acre. 

Mr. B. considers his land worth $300 an acre, because it 
 will sell for this amount. He makes no pretension to skill 
 in culture, or to knowledge of chemical science, but thinks 
 from the product of his field, he made the right apjilication 
 in the right way. The surface presented now is as handsome 
 ground for mowing as is any where to bo seen ; all the sur- 
 plus water being effectually drained off by the centre ditch, 
 with a few covered side cuts. Mr. B. proposes to put on a 
 thin coating of loam the coming winter when the ground is 
 frozen. 

It is rare that an experiment is witnessed paying so well 
 in so short a time. 

Experiment No. 2 — hy Adino Page, Danvers. 

This was on the Danvers Town Farm, on a lot containing 
 between three and four acres. Operations commenced in 
 1830. Previously it had been a sunken oSFensive morass, 
 yielding no valuable growth. 

A main ditch was cut through the centre, and shore ditch- 
 es on either side, and cross ditches about fifty feet apart. 
 Many oi' these were covered, so as not to appear on the sur- 
 face. In some places the mud was eight feet or mere deep, 
 in others from three to five feet deep. From the shores and 
 knolls adjoining gravel and loam was carried on, so as to 
 give firmness, sufiicieut to sustain the plow, when the water 
 was iirainod eighteen inches below the surface ; where the 
 soil could not be well stirred by the plow, it was effectually 
 done by the use of a meadow hoe, constructed for the pur- 
 pose. Most of the labor was done by the paupers at the 
 Alms House (chiefly foreigners), and no pains was spared to 
 have it thoroughly done. 

Ve:y little fertilizing material was applied, it being 
 thought rich enough to support any crop that could bo start- 
 ed upon it. It was sown to grass <n 1851. Very little grass 
 in 1S52, but between twelve and thirteen tons of the best 
 hay on the farm was cut on this meadow the present sea- 
 son. 

It is so situated that the surplus liquids from the pig-yard 
 and the sink can bo conducted in any quantity and diffused 
 over the land. With such an application there is good rea- 
 son to believe four tons to the acre of valuable fodder will 

be grown annually on this meadow. It is an appendage to 
 the farm of the value of eight hundred dollars at least; 
 whereas four years ago it was of no value, but rather an eye 
 sore, and an offence — breeding miasmata and death. 

The exact expense of the experiment, Mr. P. is not able 
 to estimate. The work has been done at ''odd jobs," when 
 other labors did not press, and by those who would have 
 done little else, if this work had not been done. The entire 
 operation, as superintended by Mr. Page, the master of the 
 house, is creditable to his judgment and his persevering in- 
 dustry, and the best certificate that can be given of his com- 
 petency to superintend works of improvement of much 
 greater extent. 

E.rpen'ment No. 3 — hy T. E. Poyson, of Rowley. 

This was commenced about three years ago, on a part of 
 an extensive meadow of fifty acres or more. The water 
 having been drained away by a main ditch, and a suflicient 
 number of cross ditches; Mr' Payson commenced by cutting 
 very narrow ditches about five feet apart, and throwing the 
 contents of these ditches upon the surface. 

The beds thus formed were planteil with potatoes. 

In 1852 the crops of potatoes paid for all the labor and 
 manure that had been ajiplied to the part thus treated. The 
 potatoo vines were thrown into the narrow ditches, and the 
 entire surface smoothed and sowed with grass seed. The 
 crop of good English hay the present season exceeded three 
 tons to the acre. 

Several other acres were planted with potatoes, in like 
 manner, the present season, but in consequence of the fail- 
 ure of the crops by reason of the rot, the labor has been in 
 a measure lost. Until the rot came on, Mr. P. felt encour- 
 aged to hope that ho should soon have an extended field of 
 English mowing, producing three tons or more to the acre, 
 without any expenditure of capital in bringing it about, ex- 
 cept the moderate price of about $20 an acre paid for the 
 land. 

Erperiment No. 4 — hy Horace Ware, of Marhlchead. 

This was on about three acres of swamp, situated adjoin- 
 ing a pond of about five acres. Mr. AV.'s first operation was 
 to cut a ditch through upland, of a half a mile in extent, to 
 the shore of the sea, so as to reduce the height of the water 
 in the pond four feet. This caused the surface of the swamp 
 to settle about two feet, leaving it still about two feet above 
 the pond. Then all bushes and other obstructions wore 
 cleared from the surface, and a coating of gravel and night 
 soil mixed, to the depth of about three inches, was appli- 
 ed. 

The crop of potatoes, grown on this land the first year, 
 paid for all that had been done to it, and it has since yielded 
 annually three or more tons of good English hay to the acre. 
 Mr. AY. considers this reclaimed meadow as valuable now as 
 any land appurtenant to his valuable farm. 

I might specify other experiments that I have witnessed, 
 some of which did not succeed ; probably because the work 
 was not thoroughly done, and the fertilizers applied were not 
 of the right character. But as a specifying of such opera- 
 tions may not be gratifying to those who performed them, 
 and may possibly deter others from attempting improve- 
 ments, I forbear to name them. 

It will be observed that each of the specifications given 
 are simple in their character, and such as are in the power 
 of any owner of land to imitate. I have pjreferred to sUito 
 facts with no theories appurtenant, because the one can bo 
 seen and known for certaintj', while the others are not at all 
 times so certainly known. 

In the few instances thus hastily sketched, many spears of 
 grass have been made to grow where none grew before. I 
 record them for the encouragement of those who have acres 
 of like unproductive land, capable of being reclaimed. The 
 first thing to be done is to efiectually remove all superfluous 
 water. The water should never be suffered to inttrloro with 
 the roots or fibres of the vegetable growth. In all these low 
 grounds there is an abundance of material that has been 
 accumulating for centuries, and as soon as it can be relieved 
 of excess of moisture it can be made productive. If I do 
 not mistake upon lands of this description is the best oppor- 
 tunity for successful experiment to be found on our farms, 
 especially in hay products — one of the staple productions of 
 the country. 

The same land, when reclaimed, can be made to grow veg- 
 etables in great abundance. I have never seen better pro- 
 ducts of beets than on such laud. At least thirty tons to
