THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[JtTLY 

Hankin and Co. also shipped a valuable lot the previous 
 week; their cattle were mostly purchased in the North Ri- 
 ding of Yorkshire and the county of Durham; the sheep 
 were from the same breeders as above. I regret I had not 
 nn opportunity of seeing this shipment, being absent from 
 Liverpool at the time ; but I learned from a friend residing 
 near here, interested in such matters, that they were a use- 
 ful lot of stock, about the same quantity as those of Messrs. 
 Watts and Waddle; they are also for a company in the 
 Western States of America, and for which good prices were 
 paid. I hope these continuous exports of -our best stocks 
 may induce our farmers and breeders to pay greater atten- 
 tion to the rearing of the most improved breeds of cattle, 
 as such a demand holds out every encouragement for them 

to do so.

The Big Tree from California. 

A tree of most extraordinary height and dimensions, was 
 recently felled on Sierra Nevada, California, and a portion of 
 it arived in New York last week, intended for public exhi- 
 bition. It measured, when standing, three hundred and 
 twenty feet in length, with a diameter of 32 at five feet from 
 the ground. The trunk of this huge monarch of the forest 
 was perfectly solid from the swampwood to the centre, and, 
 judging from the number of centric rings, its age has been 
 estimated at three thousand years. Of this vegetable mon- 
 ster which the proprietor has named the (?('(/o)if«i^MC)'icM«, 
 60 feet of the bark, from the lower part of the trunk, was 
 put in the natural form in San Francisco for exhibition. It 
 there formedaspaciouscarpeted-room, contaningapiano with 
 seats for 40 persons. On one occasion 140 children were ad- 
 uiited without inconvenienence; and at another time thirty- 
 two couple waltzed within its colossal circumference with the 
 gratest harmony. Public exhibition will be made of this 
 majestic tree in New York, as soon as a suitable place can 
 be procured for that purpose.

Practical Hints About Keeping Milk From Souring. 

Milk is a compound, made up of a mixture of oil, (butter,) 
 sugar, caseine (curd) and water. If allowed to stand still, 
 the oily matter will rise to the top in the form of cream. 
 There is a litlo free alkali (soda) in the water of all sweet 
 milk, and without this soda the water will not have the power 
 to keep the caseine or curd disolved. The sugar of milk is 
 also dissolved in the water. If the sugar can get access to 
 air it is constanly inclined to change to an acid, (lactic acid) 
 just as sweetened water changes to vinegar when exposed to 
 air, and we can see just why milk curdles, and how it may 
 be kept sweet. 

Wo all know that acids destroy or nutralize the effects of 
 alkalies, (such as soda, potash, lime, &c) As before stated, 
 when the milk is now, there is some free soda in it, but when 
 some acid is formed from the milk sugar, this acid neutralizes 
 the soda, and the water without the soda cannot dissolve the 
 caseine, but it separates into a mass of curd. More sugar 
 turns to more acid, and in time the whole becomes quite 
 sour. N'ow there are two ways of preventing this souring. 
 The first is, 

Keep the air away from the mine as much aa jiossihle. We 
 cannot very well keep the milk covered air-tight, but the oil 
 or cream which rises to the top formes a verv eood cover if 
 it ishept vnhrohen. If, then, it is desired to keep the milk 
 some length of time, great care should be taken to keep it still, 
 and preserve the cream undisturbed. Those who get milk 
 but once a day should divide it into several portions, each 
 portion to be kept undisturbed till it is wanted for use. The 
 second method is. 

Put into neiv milk a little extra soda to neutralize the acid 
 CM fast as it is formed. A bit of soda, say the bulk of a mar- 
 rowfat pea to a quant of milk, will not injure its taste or qual- 
 ity, while it will often keep it sweet for a day or more longer 
 than without it. We have often taken milk already begin- 
 ing to souT and curdle, and by stirring in well a little soda, 
 and rendered the milk as sweet and good as when first drawn 
 from the cow. We know that sweetened water will turn more 
 rapidly to vinegar, (acetic acid) if it is kept warm. Just so 
 the sug.ar of milk turns to acid (lactic) sooner if kept warm, 
 and on this acount the cooler milk is kept, the longer it will 
 remain sweet. 

' It is well known that heavy thunder-storm will often ren- 
 der milk speedily sour. This ni'ay be effected in two ways : 
 the agitation of a thunder clap may introduce more air into 
 the milk, and the great amount electricity passing through 
 the milk may hasten the change of the sugar to acid. We 

have heard suggested, with how much truth we cannot say, 
 though there is some plausibility in the statement, that milk 
 is less likely to bo effected by thunder if it is kept in glazed 
 earthenware instead of metal vessels like tin pans; and also 
 that it will, at such time, keep better if the vessels are placed 
 upon dry wooden benches or shelves away from the walls, 
 than if set upon the bottom of the coller or milk-room. The 
 reason assigned is, that the dry bench or shelves act as non- 
 conductors, and prevent electricity from going through tho 
 milk in its passage from the clouds to the earth. 

The most important thing in the care of milk however, is 
 to leave it undisturbed — not even moving the vessel, or agi- 
 tation the surface from the time the milk is strained, till it 
 is all required for use. 

The shallower milk vessels are made, the greater will be 
 the yield of cream, as it will the more readily rise to the top.

Splendid Floral Specimen. 
 There is now in full bloom, in the Liverpool (England) 
 Botanic Garden; a beautiful specimen of the Wistariasinen- 
 six, which coveres a space of wall amounting to nearly nine 
 hundred square feet. At the present time there are about six 
 thousand racemes or bundles of flowers on it, each bunch 
 bearing on an average about fifty-five flowers, so that it bears 
 on the whole about S.'OjOOO individual flowers, which yield 
 a most grateful perfume.

Hints About Avoiding Fires. 

Very many large fires, as well as many severe bums, may 
 be avoided by understanding that air ie necessary to produce 
 combustion, and that the exclusion ot air is as effectual as an 
 application of water. Indeed, in extinguishing fire, water 
 chiefly acts by shutting out air, and any other means of shut- 
 ting out the air is just as effectual. We have show„ .msxfe- 
 quently in lectures on heat, by pouring upon the table a 
 quantity of spirits of turpentine, alcohol, or ether, and when 
 set on fire so as to produce a large flame, we have instantly 
 extinguished it, by quickly spreading over it a silk handker- 
 chief or piece of jjaper, which for the instant shut out tho 
 air. 

A week or two since, a young lady in Danbury, Ct., upset 
 a camphene lamp, the contents of which spread over her 
 dress and enveloped her in flames, but she seized a blanket 
 from a bed, and immediately wrappied it close around her, and 
 thus smothered the fire, (shut outthe air.) and escaped with- 
 out injury. Five years since, we were transferring from one 
 vessel to another, two gallons of mixed sulphuric ether and 
 chloroform, both very inflamablo substances, whichburnt with 
 a great flame — when a person in the room, carelessly brought 
 a lighted lamp near, and set the whole on fire. AVe instantly 
 snatched a table-spread from the table near by, and with 
 it covered the flame and extinp-nished it. AVe sacrificed the 
 dishes and food upon the table, but saved the house, perhaps 
 the block of buildings, and perhaps our lives, as a moment's 
 delay would have enveloped the whole room in flames. 

Two )'e;n's since ; "ervant girl, contrary to oft-rt^j ■■liodand 
 positive directions, undertook to fill a fluid lamp while burn- 
 ing, and, as was certain to be the case, the can of liquid took 
 fire, (not "exploded,'") and was droped upon the floor,setting 
 her under garments on fire. She ran for the door, but an- 
 other domestic happened to catch hold of her outer clothes in 
 such a way as to draw them closely around her, and thus un- 
 wittingly smothered tho flame, while a member of the family 
 extinguished the burning lamp, can, and fluid from tho floor 
 by spreading an ironing cloth over it. 

Some dozen years since, one of the boys on our farm, was 
 at work in the horse and carriage barn before light, one win- 
 ter inorning. When called to breakfast he left the lantern 
 where it was knocked down by one of the horses, and a large 
 mass of straw for bedding was set on fire. When discoverd, 
 tho whole mass— four or five feet in diameter — was in flame 
 that nearly reached to the hay hanging down from a mow 
 above, containing several ton-s. In this case, a horse blanket 
 was at once thrown upon the centre of the flame, and others 
 quickly added, and the fire extinguished without damage, al- 
 though large volumes of smoke poured forth from the doors 
 and other openings, and almost j)revented any one from 
 entering. 

".We have known of instances of rooms being found on fire, 
 where hy closing them up, the fire has been confined, and 
 kept it in a smothered state until sufficient help with abun- 
 dance of w.ater could be produced to at once extinguish the 
 flames. In a great number of instances, extensive conflagra-
