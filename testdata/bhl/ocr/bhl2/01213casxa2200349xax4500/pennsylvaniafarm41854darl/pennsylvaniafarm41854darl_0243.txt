tions could have been avoided, had the fire been kept where 
 it originated till efficient aid arrived. This could have been 
 done by simply closing up doors and windows, instead of' 
 throwing them all wide open, as is usually the case. 

We have thus given a few instances, and we might add 
 many others, where serions injury has been averted by apply- 
 ing a similar preventive, that of shutting out the free access 
 of air, which is necessary to feed the flame. Let every per- 
 son tix it in their miuds, and in the minds of every member 
 of their families, old and young, that, that other means than 
 ■water may be used to smother tire. Do not teach this by 
 precept only, for in the excitemeut of a fire mere precepts 
 will be forgotten, but let a few experiments be made before 
 the family to illustrate the princiijle. 

For example, pour upon the hearth — or better upon a flat 
 stone or board out of doors — a quantity of alcohol, turpen- 
 tine, burning fluid, oil, ether, or other inflammable substances, 
 Bet it on tiro, und then extinguish it by spreading a cloth 
 quickly over it. Re-light it and extinguish it with a iiews- 
 paper, and repeat the experiment with a handkerchief, an 
 apron, a cloak, a dress, a table-cloth, bed-quilt, ic. 

The experiment may bo varied by smearing an upright 
 block, barrel, or post with oil, alcohol, or otherwise, and 
 when on fire, extinguish it with a cloth or old garment. 

Some simple experiments like these are always interest- 
 ing: they develop thought, and prepare one fcr acting coolly 
 and effectually in an emergency. They are drilling and 

manoeuvering soldiers to a battle. — Amer. Ayricidturist.

Hints to the Farmer. 
 Keep your enclosures in good repair. If a post or a stake 
 rots supply its place wiih another before it falls and intro- 
 duces your own or neighbor's cattle into your corn or wheat 
 field. Stone walls are the most valuable of all enelosers, 
 where one has the materials for erecting them, or where they 
 can be obtained within any reasonable distance, walls are 
 cheaper than any other fence that can bo constructed. A 
 iarm surrounded with good wall, may be regarded as en- 
 closed for all time; the materials, although the walls may fall, 
 or be thrown down, never decay. Next to walls, we may 
 mention stump fence as the most valuable species of field 
 enclosure. Properly constructed, on land that does not 
 "heave," they endure for generations, and ordinarily subject 
 the farmer to but litte expense for repairs. Hedges of thorn 
 are also valuable, and produce a most beautiful effect upon 
 a landscape. They are also very durable and efficient.

The Ox that Wouldn't Stay Killed. 
 A farmer drove a fat ox to market, expecting the animal 
 when killed would yield some twelve or thirteen hundred of 
 beef. He sold the ox ; the buyer drove him off, and at night 
 came back, representing that the animal had been slaughtered 
 and offered to settle for him, but showing an account of his 
 weight that fell short of the expectation of the farmer, who 
 insisted on seeing the beef, and after weighing it with the 
 tallow, he was forced to go home, though not half satisfied, 
 with the I'l'iuey in hir: pocket, louring the lughi after his re- 
 turn, the dead ox came back to his yard alive and well, hav- 
 ing broken out of the butcher's enclosure; and the next day 
 the farmer drove the same ox back to town, and ofl'ered to 
 sell him to the same butcher, who having missed the animal, 
 eyed the new comer rather suspiciously, and concluding that 
 he it was that had been sold, bought the ox at a lumping 
 price, and paid for him this time.

Transportation of Cattle on Eailroads. 

A promise sometime ago, and your further lato request 
 that I would give some of my experience and observation 
 relating to the injury done to beef cattle in driving and 
 transporting by water or on railroads for the New York 
 market, is my apology for this article. If any thing I can 
 sayoja this subject and those relating to it, in my plain waj', 
 will bo of any practical benefit, it will be at your disposal. 

Twenty years ago, the State of New-York with Connecticut 
 almost wholly supplied our city with neat cattle about three 
 parts of the year, and Pennsylvania and Ohio made up the 
 other part, which was principly^hrough the summer season. 
 But the rapid increase of popmation or consumers in our 
 great and growing city, has greatly exceded the productions 
 of the graziers of both New-York and Connecticut; in fact few- 
 er cattle are now raised and graized than were at that period. 
 I need but refer you to Dutchess County. The number now 
 sent from there (and for seVeral years past) to our citj-, is less 
 than one-half! The farmers and graziers that formerly fatt<;d 

from fifty to seventy-five cattle, now turn off some ten or fif- 
 teen, and their extra land is more profitably employed for 
 grain and other purposes. I may say that this is pretty 
 nearly so throughout the State of New-York and Connecticut, 
 we have had to depend on Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, 
 Virginia, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Arkansas. Al- 
 though we still have enough weekly to supply the demand 
 of our market which is at present about oUUO head, yet the 
 fact is, the coiieumers are growing faster than the producers, 
 and if our railroads should have another destruction or stop- 
 page, as they had some few weeks ago, and for a period of 
 two or three weeks, the New-Y'orkers would be for a while 
 be in a state of starvatiom for " fresk beef." Fifteen or twen- 
 ty years ago, driving ca<!»lc on foot was the principal mode of 
 getting them here. They were started — say from Illinois — - 
 with about 100 in a drove, and about the time when they 
 could feed on grass on their way, at a very slow rate, say 
 eight miles per day, and so eontined for sometimes 10 to 12 
 weeks before they would arrive here, at a cost of from 5 to S 
 dollars per head. Sometimes through improper driving or 
 care, they arivcd in very bad condition ; losing in flesh, and 
 fat, espeecially from the inside, and lessoning the value of the 
 beast 10 to 15 dollars. The flesh, by this improper driv- 
 ing, would be dry, hard, tough and tasteless — in fact cdl 
 driven unimah from any great distance will be so, more or 
 loss — but the flesh from the same fat animal, taken directly 
 from the " barn-yard," will bo juicy, well flavored, and ten- 
 der. I might compare them to a horse that is kept tied up 
 without work and well fed ; his flesh will bo soft, fat and 
 tender, but use and work him hard, the juices and soft fat will 
 sweat out of him, and after a while leave him with a firm, 
 dry, hard, and a tough flesh, capable of wear and long endu- 
 rance. 

But the driving has been very much improved upon; more 
 care, attention, and strong feeding (with grains) have 
 been introduced, with great advantage both to the drover and 
 butoher. 

The transportation of cattle by water and on the railroad is 
 certainly the best and cheapest plan, provided suitable ar- 
 rangements and careful handling can be given, but often you 
 will see among some of the droves, several that look as if 
 they had been scalded, burned, and bruised. Sometimes in 
 driving them on board a steamer, trey get roughly handled, 
 and are placed too near the boiler or furnace; and in put- 
 ting them on a rail-car, they are crowded and cramped togeth- 
 er, without being tied by the head, from 1-4 to 16 animals on 
 a car; and the result, is that the sudden start of the "iron 
 horse" throws some of them down, or against one another, 
 and again after delay, (audit is sometimes pays), the ani- 
 mals living without nourishment, are hungrj', thirsty, and 
 weak; not able to stand so long a time, they get down, and 
 are trampled upon by one another, and by the time they get 
 to our market, are in bruised and miserable condition. I 
 have seen many of them in this bruised, scalded, burnt, 
 sickly, and feverish condition, with swollen rumps, hips, 
 ribs, and shoulders, others with burnt sides, buttocks, heads, 
 and running sor' .'. Certainly no animal in this e-ndition 
 could be otherwisu than feverish and sickly; and of euurse 
 not proper nor wholesome food; but they are all sold to some 
 iody, and at some price. But of late our drovers have 
 given more attention and care to this subject, as many of 
 our best butchers will not knowingly buy from those who 
 have these injured cattle. I must confess that I have been 
 caught sometimes with these cattle and with loss, the injuries 
 not being alwaj's preceptible when living. 

This carrying system should be improved npon. The 
 ears should have "moveable stalls," and the cattle bo tied 
 head to the front, where they can be fed, out of moveable 
 racks, and watered by running a trough in front of them at 
 the watering placets, and careful men to take charge of them. 

This all will cost money, but the difference in the value of 
 the animals, on their arrival in our market, will well pay the 
 extra expense, and give pleasure, health, and more satis/ac- 
 tion to the consumer. TuoJfAS, F. Devoe.

Scattered all over the pasture field arc small heaps of cattle 
 droppings, which should be left to spoil the ground they cover. 
 Fix out the boys with a small be-ctle or long-hnndled mallet, and 
 send them into the pastures, and they will have fine sport in 
 knocking to pieces and Ecattering about these cow heaps. —
