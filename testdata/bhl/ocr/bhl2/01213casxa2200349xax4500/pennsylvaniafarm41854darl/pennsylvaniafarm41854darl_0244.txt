False Coloring of Cheese and Cider. 
 I have not observed that this suhjeethas even been noticed 
 in the Agricultural QaZfttc, and yet it is well worth the con- 
 sideration to the agricultural mind, and not less so of gastro- 
 nomic intelligence. Can any of your dairy correspondents 
 prove that coloring matter is beneficial to cheese; that this 
 improvement in quality is equal to the expense and trouble ? 
 Does it either hasten or retard the ripening process of cheese ? 
 Does it allow cheese to be kept longer? From the few in- 
 quiries I have made in a dairy county, I have found that 
 those most agate, in cheese-making give an exactly contra- 
 ry opinion. Thej' say that giving this color occasions consid- 
 erable expense and trouble ; they excuse themselves by say- 
 ing that the factors would not buy their cheese without it ; 
 and I suppose that the factors would say that the retail dea- 
 lers would not look at it ; and these latter that their cus- 
 tomers would not eat it. I am inclined to think that the 
 consumer and retail dealer are the most answerable for the 
 falsehood; for a lie it is, if benetical or not, as long as the 
 purchaser is allowed to believe that color is a sign of richness. 
 It onljf amounts to culpable ignorance in the consumer, while 
 the dealer shores up this ignorance by lies ; and the cheese- 
 maker cannot entirely escape a charge of countenancing, 
 through self-interest, a cowardly device. On the part of 
 consumers, I affirm my own positive opinion that uncolored 
 cheese is by far preferable; pale cheese ripens better, and is 
 ofa better flavor than colored. In these days of reform, when 
 all falsities are scouted, why should this one linger, as an ac- 
 tive lie, in the land of truth? Let the motto "trust not to 
 false appearances" descend to every day life and practice, 
 and be engraved on uncolored cheese, and may the color of 
 shame be permanently fixed in the faces of those who use 
 such uncolorable artifices. Are cheeses to be looked at or 
 eaten? If I am told that I am to have the pleasure of eating 
 a rich cheese, I would rather judge of it by my palate than 
 my eyes. This reasoning, perhaps may not seem quite so 
 conclusive as regards cider, for Apples certainly have often a 
 considerable color, hut their juice has not the same, or if so, 
 not enough to give a deep tint to the eider. I have never 
 seen the best natural cider of a dark color, certain it is, that 
 coloring is very extensively used ; and what is used would 
 be very dificult of discover}-, for it is a less delicate opera- 
 tion with cider than with cheese ; the digestion of the former 
 is of a more comprehensive nature ; after a short internal 
 disturbance it settles, and is corked submissively down till 
 used, and we will not trace its consoquenses further. In col- 
 oring cheese a kind of vegetable paste, said to be imported 
 from Spain, is, I believe, universaly used ; but in cider, 
 though the color may be often a vegetable dry and harmless, 
 yet I should much doubt whether it be not often too min- 
 eral and unwholesome. Let the Lancet decide. Are we 
 just then in blaming the Chinese, whom we are prepared to 
 suspect of coloring their teas, while our own honest trades- 
 men do the same in a homo production ? I should be glad to 
 see a confutation of these allegations in the Agricultural 
 Gazette. I should be glad to be resolved (for it may be an 
 erroneous idea) that all consumers of rich (looking) cheese, 
 and strong bodied cider, are not, so far forth, fools; and the 
 sellers of the same extent, knaves. — /. C. Leyhart, Lapstew,

Don't Eat Horse-Radish too Freely. 

It is almost hazardous to s.ay anything againsta condiment 
 so universally used and relished as that, but a word of caution 
 is needed. Horse-radish is highly stimulating and exploring 
 to the stomach, and this effect is almost always followed by 
 lassitude and weakness. We have met with several cases, 
 where persons have ignorantly used this root so freely as to 
 be scarcely able to labor at all. 

Where it is needed as a medicine small quantity of horse- 
 radish is doubtless beneficial. But wo are quite sure, from 
 considerable observation of its effects upon ourselves and 
 others, that any person using a spoonful or more at a meal, 
 ■will suffer in consequence, although the cause of this suffer- 
 ing may not be perceived, since it produces a stimulating 
 effect for the first hour or two after eating it. — Am, Agri-

McCormick's Reaper — Important Legal Decision. 

We understand that in the ease of Cyrus H. McCormick, 
 m. William H. Seymour and Dayton S. Morgan, (the Reap- 
 ing Machine case,) which was tried in the Circuit Court of 
 the United States for the Nothern District of New- York, at 

I this city, in October, 1851, and in which the plaintifi' obtain- 
 ed a verdict of over $17, 000, the Supreme Court of the Uni- 
 ted States has on a writ of error, reversed the judgement, by 
 a vote of 3 to 4, and decided, 1st: That where a patent is for 
 a p.irt of a machine being public property, the patentee is 
 entitled to recover damages only for the value of that part, 
 and not for the value of the entire machine embracing that 
 part; and 2d: That where a defendant infringes a patent 
 by making and gelling the pretended thing, the jyatentee is 
 entitled to recover as damages, not the profits of manufactur- 
 ing the patented thing, but only the patent fee for it. — Albany

Garget. 

The best remedy for garget is, to let the calf run with 
 the cow and suck it as often as possible. The next best 
 which we have practised is, to take roots of the bitter-stveet 
 — which is common in all our forests — cut them up fine, and 
 steep them in hot water, making the decoction quite strong. 
 Pour off this liquid, then mix it half and half with lard, 
 rub the cow's udder and teats well with the mixture twice 
 a day and milk her at least three times each day. Cold 
 water is very good as applied by our correspondent, so is rub- 
 bing the udder with milk fresh drawn from the cow. But 
 the bunting and frequent suckling of the calf is best of all. 
 The cow should bo turned into pasture, if not already there, 
 and be allowed no other food than the young, tender grass, 
 so long as the caking continues. — Am Ag.

A Rival to Hemp. 

The East India Company have forwarded to the Manches- 
 ter (Eng.) Commercial Association some samples of certain 
 fibrous grasses, said to grow in Assam and other districts of 
 India. One of these samples is identical with the fibric 
 known as China grass, and has been valued by Messrs. Mar- 
 shall of Leeds, at £48 to £50 per ton. Another of the sam- 
 ples seems calculated to rival the Russian hemp, a? in a re- 
 cent experiment the former bore a strain of 345 lbs., while 
 the latter could only sustain 160 pounds.

A Splendid Importation of Silesian Sheep. 

Chamberlain, Campbell k Ladd, importers of Silesian 
 sheep, received per steamer Washington sixty ewes and 
 thirteen bucks. 

We can now congratulate this firm on its present efiBcient 
 organization. While the former partners will give it char- 
 acter in the east, western wool growers will recognize in the 
 name of Wm. II. Ladd a sure guarantee that the stock they 
 import is not only of the first class of its kind, but that the 
 description of sheep must possess intrinsic exellenco of the 
 highest order. We understand somethirty of these sheep will 
 pass through our city in the course ofa week or ten days on 
 their way to Wm. H. Laud's farm. We shall try to see 
 them and give our readers the result of our observation. —

The Wire Worm Again. 

C. P. Kimball, in the Rural New Yorker, says, "The garden 
 of one of my neighbors was very much infested with wire 
 worms. He happened to open a corn cob that had been in 
 the ground, and found a uumber in the pith of the cob. 
 He took the hint, and stuck two or three half cobs around 
 each hill of corn, leaving one end visible above ground. In 
 a few days he found from one to eight in each cob."
