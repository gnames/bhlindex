Sweet Scented Vernal Grass. 

As a question has been raised among agricultural wri- 
 ters, whether the excellent flavor of Philadelphia butter 
 is owing to the cows having fed on sweet-scented vernal 
 grass [Anthoxanthum odoratum), and inasmuch as the 
 matter in dispute can only be satisfactorily settled by 
 careful experiment, I would respectfully propose that 
 one, two, or three, of our intelligent young farmers 
 should take measures next spring to test the question 
 conclusively. It is an interesting one, especially to oui' 
 dairymen ; and the exact truth ought to be ascertained, 
 and made to supercede vague speculation and guess 
 work. I would therefore suggest, that when the proper 
 season arrives the butter from a healthy milk cow, which 
 has had no opportunity to feed on vernal grass, be tasted 
 by connoisseurs and its flavor carefully noted ; that the 
 cow be then put into a clean, wholesome stable, or yard, 
 and fed exclusively and judiciously on fresh cut vernal 
 grass for a week or two, or until there can be no ques- 
 tion as to the source of her milk ; then, of this pure 
 vernal grass milk and cream, let there be another churn- 
 ing, and let the butter be tasted by the same judges, and 
 the result made known. Such an experiment, I think, 
 would satisfy every one ; and any clever young farmer, 
 who has the vernal grass in sufficient quantity on his 
 land, could try it without much trouble. The truth of 
 the matter is well worth knowing, more especially if 
 the eS'ect of the grass be as alleged ; and I trust we 
 have many young farmers in Chester and Delaware, 
 where the fine flavored butter is made, who would cheer- 
 fully take the requisite measures to settle the question. 
 The experiment proposed can scarcely be afi"ected in any 
 way by any prejudice, theoretic notion, or preconceived 
 opinion, otherwise I should hesitate to mention, now, my 
 own recent observations; for I have no desire to believe, 
 or have others to believe, any thing but the truth. I 
 may add, however, that I have long thought and re- 
 marked, that the vernal grass was not a favorite pasture 
 with cattle ; and I have this season particularly noticed 
 some of the pastui-c groimds in this vicinity, where the 
 stock had eaten the meadow grasses (Poas) close, and left 
 numerous patches of the vernal grass [Anthoxanthum) 
 untouched. Others have made the same remark. Still, 
 that does not quite determine the question concerning 
 our good butter, and I shall be curious to have that set- 
 tled. With respect to the "fine aftermath and rich au- 
 tumnal pasturage," spoken of as furnished by the vernal 
 grass, I can only say that I have not particularly ob- 

served it ; but, judging from the short, and compara- 
 tively scanty, radical foliage of this Anthoxanthum, I 
 should expect the '^aftermath" to be much inferior, in 
 quantity at least, to that of the Poa pratensis Any ob- 
 serving farmer, however, may readily determine its 
 character for himself, if he will watch the condition of 
 the vernal grass during the ensuing autumn ; and the 
 readers of the Journal will, no doubt, be glad to learn 
 the result of such observations. W. D.

State Exhibitions and Premiums. 

In 1851 there were sixteen premiums ofi'ered for one 
 breed of cattle (Durhams), amounting to $97 ; the same 
 year there were five ofi'ered for one breed of sheep 
 (South Downs), amounting to $32. (I only allude to 
 breeding stock in every instance.) 

In 1852 there were sixteen premiums for the former, 
 amounting to $110; and six for the latter, amounting to 
 $28 : here was an advance of $13 on cattle, and a re- 
 duction of $4 on sheep, which induced me to give my 
 opinion of such matters in the sixth number of the sec- 
 ond Volume of this Journal. I neither attended the ex- 
 hibition nor sent any stock to it. Last year I was in- 
 duced to attend at Pittsburgh, in hopes I might have an 
 opportunity of seeing how my Downs would compare 
 with some fine ones lately imported and taken west, but 
 I saw none there superior to my own. The number of 
 premiums there was sixteen for Durhams, amoimting to 
 $162, and for South Downs there were six, amounting 
 to $48 ; the first three I took and one of the second, 
 which left but two second ones for the other competitors 
 to contend for. 

Now why, I would ask, is it that those who have the 
 fixing of premiums should hold out so much greater in- 
 ducements to the breeders of cattle than of sheep ? Do 
 they believe that first rate mutton is inferior to first rate 
 beef ? If so there is the more need to improve it. Now 
 I believe it is really better, and that it would be to the 
 interest of consumers to encourage the production of it 
 rather than of beef. Our markets are already well sup- 
 plied with good beef, but who can say in truth they are 
 well supplied with good mutton ? Does not our Penn- 
 sylvania hills and mountains present as fine sheep walks 
 as any other State in the Union, and such as never can 
 be so well applied to any other purpose as to the rearing 
 of sheep ? I would, therefore, most respectfully sug- 
 gest to the committee who have the fixing of premiums, 
 if they do really think that mutton is inferior to beef,
