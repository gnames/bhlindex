that they would at least increase the number of premi- 
 ums, and say for the best buck of any age, secon* best 
 do ; best two year old, second best do ; best yeai-ling, 
 second best do ; best buck lamb, second best do ; and 
 continue the same number with the ewes and ewe lambs, 
 which would still be eight less for Downs than for Dur- 
 hams ; so that if the premium for a good buck is only 
 half that of a good bull, we may have more of them ; 
 besides, if I should ever be induced to show my Downs 
 at another State exhibition, I should (as I told the 
 judges of Downs at Pittsburgh) have no wish to carry off 
 all the premiums. 

At our next exhibition the premiums for Durhams 
 number twenty-four (four more than last year), which 
 amount to $190; while the number for South Downs are 
 but six, amounting to $48. Now it is my decided judg- 
 ment that it would be much better to increase the num- 
 ber of premiums in other departments ; the more prizes 
 and fewer blanks, the greater inducement that will be to 
 both farmers and mechanics to assist in making a good 
 display, and as they make the show (that makes the cash 
 shoiv) I believe many more of them ought to be recom- 
 pensed. 

What interest can many feel in the proposed project 
 of the Society purchasing land and establishiag a high 
 school, where young men are to be taught the trade of 
 farming, probably after they have learned the trade of 
 living without laboring ? I would not have it thought 
 that I am opposed to the Society purchasing a moderate 
 sized farm near some town or city, where all the profes- 
 sional aid necessary might be obtained at a remunerating 
 or ample salary. Place a good farmer on it, and if they 
 should produce any thing very beneficial our practical 
 men will not be slow to profit by it and communicate it 
 to others, without expending a large amount of capital 
 in a farm and fixtures in which the majority are not 
 likely to feel much interest. These exhibitions are the 
 product of labor, and if the funds derived therefrom are 
 not distributed or applied in such manner as to give gen- 
 eral satisfaction to the exhibitors, my impression is that 
 they will soon dwindle into insignificance. The novelty 
 may attract for a while, but the laboring community sel- 
 dom relish that long. 

And now, after having this much exposed myself, I 
 feel disposed to add a little on the subject of selecting 
 judges, as I have feared that it is seldom thought 
 to be a matter of as much importance as it should 
 be. The first requisite I conceive to be a qualifica- 
 tion to judge of the true merits of the animals or ar- 
 ticles examined, and the next is to be just as impartial, 
 conscientious and upright as though he were under an 
 affirmation to try a man for theft ; and my belief is, if 
 he does not thus act, and is through fear, favor or aflTec- 
 tion, induced to make an unjust decision, he is, in truth, 
 a robber. The late Thomas Pjates, whose reputation as 
 a breeder of Durham cattle for the last twenty years has 
 not been surpassed by any breeder in England, told me 
 that he had not shown any of his stock for several years 
 previous to the first Royal Exhibition, held at Oxford in 
 1839, (where he took all the first class prizes that he 
 contended for,) because of the wrongs he had suffered 
 through ignorance and injustice ; and I feel quite satis- 
 . fied (without alluding to myself in the remotest manner) 

that some of our most spirited breeders in this country 
 have avoided the risk of exposing their stock, because 
 of the frequent occurrences of such cases in this coun- 
 try. The man who submits to act as a judge places 
 himself in a very responsible, thankless, burdensome 
 and laborious station, if he is disposed to perform his 
 duty ; and if he does not, he ought to remember there 
 are perhaps hundreds present on such occasions whose 
 judgment is quite equal to his own, and that, if there is 
 any occasion to do so, will not hesitate to judge him as 
 well as that he is to judge. I view the whole as a mat- 
 ter of innocent amusement if rightly conducted, and it 
 is cause of regret that occasion should be given to any 
 one to return home with wounded feelings. 

And now, after assuring both editor and readers that 
 although I feel quite incompetent to write for publica- 
 tion, yet, as it always afi"ords me satisfaction to see the 
 author's name appended, I shall subscribe mine ; and I 
 conceive this advantage at least by so doing, when my 
 signature is seen, and my bungling style of writing is 
 recollected, the reader can pass on and look for some- 
 thing more interesting, as I often do when I see an arti- 
 cle without a signature, or perhaps only a single letter.

Mr. DARtiNGTON : â€” Under the above name I have had 
 in cultivation, for a number of years, a vegetable which 
 I consider worthy of being generally cultivated. It was 
 introduced originally from China, and through the kind- 
 ness of a friend in Illinois (Dr. Kennicott) I first re- 
 ceived the seed. It was represented to be a delicious 
 substitute for asparagus, but not knowing the part used 
 as such I have not until this season fully discovered its 
 value. It is a species of lettuce, and while young used 
 in the same way, but its greatest value consists (at least 
 such will be the opinion of all lovers of asparagus) in 
 being an admirable substitute for that most excellent 
 vegetable when the plants are shooting up, and before it 
 comes into flower ; the stems being very tender, and 
 when from a quarter to half an inch in diameter, and 
 eighteen inches to two feet high, may be cut into lengths 
 and cooked in the same manner as asparagus. I will 
 not say that it cannot be distinguished from that vegeta- 
 ble, but I do consider it quite as delicious, and on the 
 same space of ground where a dozen dishes of asparagus 
 can be cut after three or four years of patient and high 
 cultivation, one hmidred may be cut of the Hoo Sung in 
 three or four loeeks ! I have a small patch going to seed, 
 which I will distribute to any who wish to make a trial 
 of it, by letting me know their wishes. A pre-paid let- 
 ter with a stamp, or pre-paid envelope enclosed, will en- 
 sure a return of the seed. Yours, &c.,
