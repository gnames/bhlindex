ed afterwards, nothing but very extraordinary skill, indeed, 
 can gave them. 

This is speaking of trees generally. Some trees have very 
 spongy wood, in which moisture is stored or accumulated; — 
 on this moisture they can subsist till the tree has had time 
 to form new fibres. To this class belong the ailanthus, pau- 
 lownia, catalpa, some poplars and willows. Others have half 
 fleshy roots, and can draw a small amount of moisture from 
 these for a time. The horso-chesnut, ash, lindens, many 
 maples, and some evergreens, are of this kind. These do 
 not suffer so certainly from the want of fibres, as the major- 
 ity of trees comprising the numerous varieties of oak, hick- 
 ory, birch, beech, chesnut, &c. 

Now, as the roots of a tree are continually forming fibres, 
 except when actually enveloped in frozen soil, it directly 
 follows that the longer time we give a tree before the burst- 
 ing of its buds, in which to establish itself after transplant- 
 ing, the better able will it be to meet the demands of the 
 foliage for moisture when the warm weather comes ; and this 
 brings me at once to the pith of the subject — the advantage 
 of Autumn Planting. A tree planted as soon after the fall 
 of the leaf as possible, will begin to form fibres at once, and 
 continue to do so till spring calls the foliage into action, 
 when the roots will be able to meet any ordinary demand 
 made on them; at any rate it has a better chance than the 
 same tree would have if planted in the spring. 

I do not deny that spring planting has many favorable 
 points of view. In my recent work on trees, I have freely 
 granted this ; and I would here even go so far with its ad- 
 vocates as to admit that in some cases, and in skilful hands, 
 trees can be made to do better when planted early in spring 
 than in the fall ; but as a general ride, and in general hands, 
 and for the reasons I have given, autumn is the safest, and 
 in many casea the only safe time in which to remove 
 trees. 

I am aware that advice from a nurseryman often loses 
 much of its weight, through his being supposed to be inter- 
 ested, and in the present case I am free to confess that I 
 have an interest in the advice I have given. It is unpleas- 
 ant to have one's customers come when the trees are actually 

in leaf, with "we bought some trees of last season, but 

they died ; we want to see if yours will do any better." Is 
 it not, Mr. Freas, enough to make any man look "wide 
 awake," when his business reputation hangs on such slender 
 threads; and need he blush to avow interested motives in 
 taking every opportunity to difiuse sound practical informa- 
 tion?

Alsyke Clover. 

Wo copy the following from the London Gardeners' Chron- 
 icle, and ask the attention of our readers to it. The seeds of 
 this clover have been distributed by the Patent Office for a 
 year or two, but we have not heard of any one giving it a 
 fair trial. 

The following is from a printed circular : "Alsyke," or 
 Perennial Hybrid Clover Seed, is indigenous in Sweden, 
 where it has been cultivated in the native pastures of that 
 country for the last hundred years, and has in some cases 
 been known to grow to the height of five feet, although in 
 England it attains only that of two feet. The root is fibrous 
 and the heads globular. The plant bears a greater resem- 
 blance to the white than to the rod clover ; and although its 
 stems are recumbent, they do not root into the soil like those 
 of the white clover ; in short, it may be described as a "gi- 
 ant" white clover, with flesh-colored flowers. The plant 
 yields two mowings annually. Linnaeus observed the Alsyke 
 clover growing on poor, bare, obdurate clays in the Morea, 
 where no other plant could be made to vegetate ; and yet, 
 under such unfavorable circumstances, this clover flourished 
 with an uncommon degree of luxuriance, and yielded shoots 
 as tender and succulent, although not so abundant, as if 
 reared in the most richly-manured fields. Mieheli mentions 
 the plant as growinsr in open situations on a clayey soil, and 
 as being, in his opinion, worthy of cultivation. Sturm says 
 it is found in Holland, and that he tried its cultivation along 
 with that of a great number of other clovers, placed under 
 the same circumstances, and that the result convinced him 
 that there is no other kind of clover equal to it for the pur- 
 pose of feeding cattle. The red clover will last only two 
 years in perfection, and often, if the soil be cold and moist, 
 nearly half of the plants will rot, and in the second year 

bald places will be found in every part of the field ; besides 
 that, in September and October many crops left for seed are 
 lost in consequence of the heavy rains during that period ; 
 while the Alsyke clover, on the contrary, ripening its seed 
 much sooner, and continuing in vigor much longer, much 
 risk and expense are avoided, and a larger profit accordingly 
 accrues. Further, when this plant is once established, it will 
 remain for a great many years in full vigor, and produce an- 
 nually a great quantity of herbage of excellent quality. 
 The best method of disposing of the Alsyke clover crop is 
 either by mowing it for hay, cutting it occasionally as green 
 food, or feeding it down with sheep, in which latter case it 
 map be turned on sooner than any other clover; and if eat- 
 en down quite bare, and the stock taken olf the first week in 
 June, the next crop will come sooner to the scythe than any 
 other species of clover so treated ; and if saved for seed, the 
 seed will be ripe sooner than any other, and the plant will 
 again afford a good bite for the sheep until the land be re- 
 quired to plow for wheat — a heavier crop of which is inva- 
 riably produced after Alsyke than any other clover. If 
 mown for hay, it should be cut as soon as most of the heads 
 are in full bloom, and before they begin to turn brown and 
 die away. Obsen-e the foliage in the lower parts of the 
 plants — when the leaves turn yellow, decay and drop off, the 
 crop should be cut; for by standing longer, the plant will 
 lose more at the bottom than it gains at the top. The 
 weight of the seed required to be sown is, according to cir- 
 cumstances, from ten to fifteen pounds per acre, an extent of 
 crop which will produce many tons annually of green her- 
 bage, independent of a crop of seed. The hardy nature of 
 the plant is proved by the fact of its thriving by transplan- 
 tation; it will admit of being taken up at the expiration of 
 two or three years and planted in any other situation ; the 
 plant when taken up is merely divided, and its fibrous roots 
 cut a little with a pruning knife ; so that the farmer need 
 never be at a loss for a crop of clover. The Alsyke does not 
 suffer from the severest frosts ; it will flourish on the most 
 barren land, where few grasses will grow at all, producing a 
 heavy crop of seed, and affording an abundance of nutri- 
 tious herbage for horses, oxen, and sheep; and when land 
 has become clover-sick, and cannot be depended on for a 
 crop of the ordinary sorts of clover, this has never been 
 known to fall" 

Vsing Com for that which is not Bread. 

The whiskey manufacturers of Ohio, recently held a con- 
 vention in Cincinnati. It appears that twenty-three es- 
 tablishments were represented. These twenty-three use up 
 14,000 bushels of grain every day! This makes over five mil- 
 lions of bushels in a year, and these twenty-three establish- 
 ments are but a sriiall part of the whole of them. This is 
 using bread to destroy bread. Thousands by using the 
 whiskey thus made, find themselves and children starving for 
 want of the grain of which it is made.

Animals Foretelling the Weather. — Instinct and Beason. 

It is said that the woodcock in New Jersey is building its 
 nest, this year, in open and moist places ; and old huntsmen 
 predict in consequence that the summer will be a dry one. 
 There was a time when science, or what was called such, 
 laughed at signs of this description, as no better than "old 
 womens' tales ;" but though many of them are still unrelia- 
 ble, a larger observation of nature has taught that animals 
 have an instinct, which not unfrequently becomes prophetic, 
 as in this example. At last year's meeting of the American 
 Association for the advancement of Science, a curious paper 
 was read on this subject, by Mr. N. B. Thomas, of Cincin- 
 nati, who had, for several years, studied the habits of ani- 
 mals in reference to the indications which they might afford 
 respecting the weather. He showed that birds, if the sear- 
 son was to be a windy or wet one, built their nests in shel- 
 tered places ; but, if it was to be dry, in localities more ex- 
 posed ; that certain kinds of snails always came out, and 
 crept up the limbs of trees several days before rain ; — and 
 that locusts, wasps and other insects were invariably to be 
 found under leaves, and in the hollow trunks of trees, hours 
 before a storm set in. 

The sagacity thus displayed, if we may call it such, seems 
 to put the higher reason of man to shame. In vain do our 
 most expert savans endeavor to predict the character of an 
 approaching season, or even to foretell, a few days in ad- 
 vance, the condition of the weather. The woodcock that
