Hymn to the Flowers. 

BY HORACE SMITH. 

Day stars ! that opo your eyes with morn to twinkle 

From Rainbow galaxies of earth's creation, 
 And dew-drops on her lovely altars sprinkle 
 As a libation ! 

Ye matin worshippers ! who, bending lowly. 
 Before the uprising Sun, God's lidless eye, 
 Throw from your chalices a sweet and holy 
 Incense on high ! 

Ye bright Mosaics ! that with storied beauty, 

The floor of Nature's temple tesselate. 
 What numerous emblems of instructive duty. 
 Your forms create ! 

'Neath cloister'd boughs, each floral bell that swingeth, 

And tolls its perfume on the passing air. 
 Makes Sabbath in the fields, and ever ringeth 
 A call to prayer ! 

Not to the domes, whore crumbling arch and column, 

Attest the feebleness of mortal hand, 
 But to that Fane, most Catholic and solemn, 
 Which Heaven hath plann'd — 

To that Cathedral, boundless as our wonder. 

Whose quenchless lamps the sun and moon supply, 
 Its choir, the winds and wave, its organ, thunder. 
 Its dome the sky ! 

There, as in solitude and shade, I wander, 

Through the green aisles, or stretched upon the sod, 
 Aw'd by tlie silence reverentially ponder 
 The ways of God — 

Your voiceless lips, flowers ! are living preachers ! 

Each cup a pulpit, every leaf a book. 

Supplying to my fancy numerous teachers, 

From loneliest nook ! 

Floral apostles ! that in dewy splendor, 

"Weep without woe and blush without a crime," 
 Oh ! may I deeply learn, and ne'er surrender. 
 Your lore sublime ! 

"Thou wert not, Solomon ! in all thy glory, 

Array'd," the lilies cry, "in robes like ours ; 
 How vain your grandeur ! ah, how transitory 
 Are HUMAN flowers!" 

In the sweet-scented pictures. Heavenly Artist! 

With which thou paintest nature's wide-spread hall, 
 What a delightful lesson thou impartest 
 Of love to all ! 

Not useless are ye, flowers, though made for pleasure. 

Blooming o'er field and wave by day and night; 
 From every source, your sanction bids me treasure 
 Harmless delight. 

Ephemeral sages ! what instructors hoary. 

For such a world of thought could furnish scope ! 
 Each fading calyx, a memento mori. 
 Yet fount of hope! 

Posthumous glories! angel-like colloction, 

Uprais'd from seed or bulb, interr'd in earth, 
 Ye are to mo a type of resurrection 
 And second birth ! 

Were I, God ! in churehless lands remaining, 

Far from all voice of teachers and divines, 

My soul would find, in flowers of thy ordaining, 

Priests, sermons, shrines! 

Late Sown "Vegetables. 
 Some of the greatest delicacies for table use may bo ob- 
 tained from quite late sowings. We can speak most posi- 
 tively in regard to turnips. Both the round and flat turnip 
 may bo sown at any time in .July or August, and we have 
 known it come to considerable maturity in a season in which 
 there was no early frosts, when sown in the first week of 
 September. Special pains should be taken to enrich the 
 soil, for in this way we secure two objects — the more rapid 
 growth of tiio plant, and a sweeter and more tender vegetiv- 
 ble. We suppose it is generally known that the more rapid 
 the growth of this and several other vegetables, the more 

mild and tender they are to the taste. Cabbages, onions, 
 radishes, squashes, cauliflower, are all much more delicate in 
 flavor, and agreeable to the palate when grown freely and 
 rapidly, than when their growth is stinted or slow. Cucum- 
 bers and celery may also be added to the above named, as 
 being much milder when grown rapidly than when of slow 
 growth. Some of these may be raised late in the season, as 
 well as turnips, so as to supply the table with the delicacies 
 of spring and summer until quite late in the fall and win- 
 ter. 

By the end of July and in the course of August, there 
 will be vacant places in the garden and field, which it will 
 be good economy to sow with turnips. There will be, at all 
 events, the pea and early potatoe ground; these and other 
 such patches may be sown with round or even flat turnip, 
 and thereby, we will be making provision both for our fami- 
 ly and stock. What we do not use for the table will be well 
 relished by our cattle; and cows which have a tolerable sup- 
 ply will not dry up so early as cows that have no green feed.

Variety of Food Necessary. 

It is in vegetable as in animal life ; a mother crams her 
 child exclusively with arrow-ruot — it becomes fat, it is true, 
 but, alas! it is rickety, and gets its teeth very slow, and with 
 difliculty. Mamma is ignorant, or never thinks, that her oflT- 
 spring cannot make bone — or, what is the same thing, phos- 
 phate of lime, the principle bulk of bone — out of starch. It 
 does its best; and were it not for a litle milk and bread, per- 
 haps now and then a litle meal and soup, it would have no 
 bones and teeth at all. Farmers keep poultrj'; and what is 
 true of fowls is true of cabbage, a turnip, or an car of wheat. 
 If we mix with the food of fowls asufiicient quantity of egg- 
 shells or chalk, which they eat greaJily, they will lay many 
 more than before. A well-fed fowl is disposd to lay a vast 
 number of eggs, but cannot do so without the matirials for 
 the shells, however nourishing in other respects her food 
 may be. A fowl, with the best will in the world, not finding 
 any lime in the soil, nor mortar from walls, nor calcareous 
 matter in her food, is incapacitated from laying any eggs at 
 all. Let farmers lay such facts as these, which are matters 
 of comon observation, to heart, and transfer the analogy, as 
 they may do, to the habits of plants, which are as truly alive, 
 and answer as closely to every injudicious treatment, as their 
 own horse. 

To Saise Giant Asparagus. 

A writer in one of the early volumes of the Horticulturist, 
 (Mr. Downing we believe.) tolls how to grow common aspjT- 
 agus so that it will always rival giant production. He says: 

Every one who has seen my beds, has deged me for seed — 
 thinking it a new sort — but I have pointed to the manure 
 heap — (the farmer's best bank,) and told them that the sec- 
 ret all laid there. The sight was only such as might be in 
 every garden. 

Aliout the first of November — as soon as the frost has well 
 blackened the Asparagus tops — I take a scythe, and mow all 
 down close to the surface of the bod. let it lie a daj- or two, 
 then set fire to the heap of stalks : burn it to ashes, and 
 spread the ashes over the surface of the bed. 

I then go to my barn-yard : I take a load of clean, fresh 
 stable manure, and add thereto, half a bushel of hen dung: 
 turning over and mixing the whole together throughout. 
 This makes a pretty powerful compost. I applj' cue such 
 load to every twenty feet in in length of my asp.aragus beds, 
 which are six feet wide. With a strong three-prong ipud or 
 fork, I dig this dressing under. The whole is now left for 
 the winter. 

In the spring, as early as possable, I turn the top of the 
 bed over lightly, once more. Now as the a-sparagus grow.i 
 naturally on the side of the ocean, and loves salt water' I give 
 it an annual supply of its favourite condiment. I cover the 
 surface of the bed about a quarter of an inch thick with fine 
 packing salt; it is not too much. As the spring rains come 
 down, it gradually dissolves. Not a weed will apear during 
 the whole season. Everything else, pigweed, purslane, all 
 refuse to grow on the top of my asparagus bed^. But it 
 would do your eyes good to see the stmng, stout, tender 
 stalks of the vegetable itself pushing through the surface 
 early in the season. I do not at all stretch a point when I 
 sny that they are as largo around as my hoe handle, and &a 
 tender and succulent as any I ever tasted. The same round 
 of treatment is given to my bed every yer.r.
