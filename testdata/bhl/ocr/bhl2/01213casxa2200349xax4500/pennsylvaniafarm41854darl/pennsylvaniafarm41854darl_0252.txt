Guenon's System. 
 In looking over a late number of tbe Boston Cultiva- 
 tor, I see an article on "Guenon's Discovery for Judging 
 Milk Cows," which seems quite at variance with your 
 corrcspoudent's ("Science") remarks on this subject, and 
 also with my own expei-ience as far as it has gone. Ar- 
 ticle 1st: "There are some cows in which the external 
 marks described by Guenon do not exist at all. Among 
 these, superior milkers are not uncommon." A thing I 
 have never met with. I have read Guenon carefully, and 
 made several examinations, and have never in my expe- 
 rience met with a good milker that was not a well mark- 
 ed cow (constitution and form being taken into consid- 
 eration). I have never met with a cow in my observa- 
 tions that has not some mark as described by Guenon 
 about her. I am acquainted with a drover that sells on 
 an average 1000 cows a year, and he has taken pains to 
 study Guenon and apply it. . For the last four or five 
 years he says he has not met with a good cow that was 
 not marked according to the look, and that he can al- 
 ways obtain a better price for a well marked cow than 
 an inferior one, for they always give satisfaction. I 
 wish the article in question had been more explicit, and 
 stated whether the person in question, who made the ex- 
 aminations. Knew a "bastard" (so called) from a genuine 
 cow, and if any of the cows he met with, that he said 
 were well marked and inferior milkers, were not touched 
 with "bastardy." A close observer can soon distinguish 
 one from the other, and this is a most important part 
 of the discovery. Till something appears, more convin- 
 cing than the article above mentioned, I am still a be- 
 liever in "GUENON." 

The above communication is from one of our practical 
 men, who, like our correspondent "Science," has fully 
 tested the truth of Guenon's system. Indeed, the far- 
 mers and dairymen of this section, having the evidence 
 of their own experience, cannot be argued out of it. 
 The article referred to above from the Boston Cultivator 
 appears as editorial, and is probably from the pen of 
 Sanford Howard, whose knowledge of stock and ability 
 as a writer entitles his remarks to consideration. As 
 the subject is one of great importance to the farmer, 
 STfpposing Guenon's system to be true, we are willing it 
 should be fully canvassed, pro and con, in our Journal. 
 Although not ourselves fully posted up in the science, 
 having never studied it, and depending for our belief on 
 what we have seen and known of its application by those 
 who have studied it, and whose siiccess in selecting cows 
 is a matter of notoriety to farmers throughout this dairy 
 district, we have been surprised at the assertions in 
 the article in the Boston Cultivator. The editor says, 
 "the most skillful, when called to decide on the qualities 
 of cows whose yield of milk was well known, erred sev- 
 en times on eight cows, and fifteen times on twenty-one. 
 Other estimates also proved erroneous 152 times on 174 
 cows, and 321 times on 352, amounting to 921 pints of 
 milk, on a total of 2,638 pints; in other words, error in 
 regard to almost all the cows, amounting on an average 
 to more than one-third of their yield." Now are not 
 these discrepancies and contradictions most extraordi- 
 nary ; the editor's experience on one side, who proved 
 the system erroneous 7 times out of 8, and 321 times out 

of 362, and that of the drover alluded to by our corres- 
 pondent above, and whom we have also long known as a 
 highly respectable and reliable man, selling 1000 to 1200 
 cows a year, and who, in all his lai-ge experience, has 
 proved it entirely correct. 

AVell may the uninitiated be puzzled to arrive at the 
 truth. The fair presumption would seem to be, that 
 "the most skillful persons" referred to knew very little, 
 or very imperfectly, the minute, though distinct and pal- 
 pable, difi'erences between Guenon's classes and orders, 
 and that their failures should not weigh against the oth- 
 er proof, for the very ob^^ous reason that negative evi- 
 dence should not weigh fignvusi positive. This is a rule 
 of law as well as of common sense. A person who had 
 never read Guenon's work at all, but had some indefinite 
 knowledge of it acquired by hearsay, might fail in 999 
 cases out of 1000, yet this failure should not alfect the 
 truth of the discovery so much as the positive fact of a 
 person being able to identify good cows by these marks 
 in nine cases out of ten, or, as in the case of the drover, 
 with some four or five thousand cows within the last five 
 years. 

What can the Boston Cultivator say to the evidence on 
 the very satisfactory trial of the Philadelphia Agricul- 
 tural Society, in the presence of hundreds of witnesses, 
 sanctioned and confirmed by the signatures of the very 
 respectable and intelligent committee â€” many of whom 
 were previously prejudiced against it, and who from 
 their well known standing here, were of all others the 
 least likely to be deceived. The examiner (Nefflin) was 
 a sti'anger to nearly all present, had never before seen 
 the cows, and there could not have been a more thor- 
 oughly impartial test, and the same may be said of the 
 numerous trials in France, all equally substantiated. This 
 is positive testimony, the other is negative. The inference 
 is fair that the failures have resulted from want of a 
 thorough understanding, or examination, of the marks 
 laid down in the book, and confusion between those in- 
 dicating genuine and bastard cows and the different 
 classes and orders. We ourselves doubt the possibility 
 of defining to the exact number of pints or quarts, which 
 a cow may invariably yield, as these may be affected by 
 various other controlling causes. A good cow may be 
 entirely ruined by bad milking, or she may have a bad 
 constitution, or she may be addicted to abortion, all of 
 which will affect the quantity of her milk, but we value 
 the system highly as an approximation to correctness, 
 more infallible than any other points of choosing a good 
 milch cow, and have found it most especially valuable in 
 determining the length of time she will go dry, quite as 
 important a matter as deep milking, and which is not 
 pretended to be attempted by any other points of selec- 
 tion we are acquainted with. 

The whole question, at last, is very much one of fact, 
 which all farmers have the means of determining for 
 themselves. We advise all to do as farmers in this sec- 
 tion have done, examine and prove the thing for them- 
 selves. 

It has been said that those who buy by Guenon's 
 marks also observe other points, which are generally re- 
 cognised as indicating a good cow. This is partly true 
 as they do pay attention to general form, constitution, 
 &c., but do not regard them so certain as the othex-s, and
