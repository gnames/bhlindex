"The officers and board of managers of the society 
 deserve great credit for the exertions they are making to 
 get up an exhibition that shall do honor to Old West- 
 moreland. By the way, let every fanner, and all who 
 take an interest in that which raises the character of our 
 county for improvements in agriculture, horticulture and 
 the breedi ig of the best of stock and all domestic ani- 
 mals, come up and enroll themselves as members of the 

Westmoreland County Agricultural Society; and thus 
 give their direct influence, with but little expense of 
 time or money to themselves, to promote these great 
 ends. The officers of the Society are sacrificing their 
 time, and even their money, freely, in perfecting the ne- 
 cessary plans to make the exhibition respectable, and 
 exhibitors comfortable ; and will yoxi not give your names 
 to second their efforts ?

FAT SUFFOLK PIG. 

The above engraving represents a Suffolk pig, bred 
 and killed by John R. Page, Esq., of Sennett, Cayuga 
 county. New York. Mr. Page assures us it was the 
 smallest of a litter, and when killed at six months old 
 weighed two hundred and thirteen pounds, measured 
 thirteen inches through the shoulders, and a little less 
 through the hams. Mr. Page, it is needless for us to 
 add, has some more of the same stock left. 

Large Clip of Wool. 

Washington county is the great wool growing county 
 of Pennsylvania, but J. S. Coe, an enterprising wool 
 grower of an adjoining county (Fayette), sends out a 
 challenge in the result of his clip the present season 
 which will be hard to excel. His Spanish sheep clipped 
 10 to 11 pounds of washed wool, and his French 23 to 
 24 pounds. 

Rust in Wheat. 
 The wheat crop in Chester county has been very se- 
 riously reduced the present season by rust. By the fol- 
 lowing, which we clip from one of our foreign exchanges, 
 it would appear as if a finely pulverized and well pre- 
 pared seed bed previous to sowing might act as a pre- 
 ventive. We never heard the idea suggested before, but 
 as the prevalence of rust is often inexplicable to far- 
 mers, it may be well to hear what they say about it on 

the other side of the water. AVe often see wheat fields 
 after seeding left very rough and cloddy, which, without 
 any reference to rust, is a great drawback to the regular 
 germination and growth both of wheat and grass seeds. 
 The article is as follows : 

"The rust complained of in your leading article of the 
 17th inst. is, I conclude, one of the Uredines — very pro- 
 bably Uredo rubigo. The probable occasion of its ap- 
 pearance arises from the foetid (rancid, impure) and 
 damp air contained in the clods of earth, for want of 
 closer comminution of the soil and consequent free cir- 
 culation of the elements. The sap eliminated from the 
 minerals in conjunction with foul air causes the plant to 
 become diseased, and to exhale from its stomata or 
 mouths an atmosphere adapted for the vegetation of that 
 variety of the fungus. The best remedy is to expose 
 the atoms of the clods forthwith to the air, and gener- 
 ally stir the soil around the plants most carefully Avith a 
 hand-hoe, and the diseased plants will be found to revive 
 and throw off such disease in due course, the quicker 
 according to the different stnges of growth of the blight 
 and general tillage of the soil ; and further, such stir- 
 rings needs be continued throughout the season as long 
 as practicable. This advice is deducted from much 
 study. The remedy will be found equally efficacious to 
 any of the order Coniomycetes or dusty fungus, mildew. 
 or mould."
