 Food, &c. — Its small Proportion of Lime. 
 In the last number we glanced at the progress of vegeta- 
 ble development from the earliest periods of its existence up 
 to that in which it is prepared for such nutriment as the far- 
 mer may be able to supply to it, together with that already 
 existing in the soil. Let us now ask ourselves how are the 
 filthy materials that are used to improve the land transformed 
 into combinations that gratify the palate, and nourish our 
 bodies ? 

Let us accompany some of these filthy materials in their 
 course through a stalk of corn, or perhaps a stalk of oats 
 would better serve for illustration, as we have more extended 
 analysis of this plant. Once located at the roots of a stalk 
 of oats, with compounds of potash, soda, sulphuric acid and 
 phosphoric acid, <fcc., around us, the first requisite is water 
 to dissolve the substance that we propose accompanying. 
 Rain comes, and the roots are surrounded with a portion of 
 soluble matter. This soluble matter commences entering all 
 the newly formed parts of the root, but most rapidly through 
 the extreme ends of the small hair-like fibres that extend 
 from the same ; on these ends is a very soft spongy matter, 
 well adapted to this purpose. The question, why under 
 these circumstances water will enter the roots, and mount to 
 the highest tip of the tallest tree against the force of gravi- 
 ty, has, in times past, very much engaged the attention of 
 vegetable physiologists ; but it is now generally admitted to 
 be due to a principle illustrated by the following experiment: 
 Take any tube, as an ordinary lamp funnel, and over one 
 end of it tie a piece of bladder, and then fill it with a solu- 
 tion of sugar, and place the lower end in a vessel of water. 
 The water will pass through the membrane into the funnel, 
 at the same time a smaller portion of the solution will pass 
 out We thus get an increase of substance in the fun- 
 nel. 

The most careful microscopic examinations have shown 
 that all parts of plants consist of cells. The stately oak is 
 not a solid mass of wood, but from the delicate fibres at the 
 root to the leaves it is built of cells, as much so as is an or- 
 dinary wasp's nest [to use a familiar object for a compari- 
 son]. These cells, it is true, in the older parts of the plant 
 become filled up with solid matter sometimes, but this mat- 
 ter is of a different character from the cell itself. These 
 cells, unlike those of the wasp's nest, are closed on all sides, 
 so that all substances which enter them must pass through 
 their lining membrane, in the same manner the water passed 
 through the bladder into the funnel alluded to above. 

Our already dissolved substance, coming in contact with 
 the external side of the membrane of these cells at the ex- 
 treme and delicate ends of the roots, passes through into the 
 coll, at the same time that a portion of the syruppy contents 
 passes out as does the sugar out of the funnel. 

Once within our cell, which may be so small that two or 
 three millions of them can bo encompassed in a cubic inch, 
 the next cell above presents the same relation to this that 
 this did to the external solution ; hence it is entered, and 
 thus we go from cell to cell, passing millions of them in our 
 course, till we arrive at the leaf. In plants of more than 
 one year's growth, the course of this circulation is principally 
 through the outer and newer layers of the wood (the white 
 wood). 

The fluid once in the leaves is concentrated by evapora- 
 tion. Its excess of water passes off, and the dissolved inor- 
 ganic constituents are next directed to the different parts of 
 the plant according to their quality. Such of them as are 
 required by the seed are separated from the others and enter 

it. Those not necessary to its growth are left in the other 
 organs that lie adjacent to the seed, or are allowed to remain 
 in the leaf, by which in perennial plants they get back to 
 the earth again, when the leaf falls off ; or they may go to 
 fill up the old cells of the plant, which are no longer needed 
 as a passage for fluids. 

The farmer can readily see that if the above process takes 
 place, we cannot tell, by the analysis of a single plant, or 
 any number of plants grown in similar circumstances, what 
 is really essential to its growth. How much of the material 
 that the chemist finds in the ash is the residue thus separa- 
 ted from that really required by the plant ? This is a ques- 
 tion of the deepest interest, both in a theoretical and prac- 
 tical view, and it is one to which the agricultural chemist of 
 the present day is particularly directed. And it may be that 
 when it is once satisfactorily answered, much of the varia- 
 tion that is found to exist in the amount of the inorganic 
 constituents of plants will be accounted for. For instance, 
 a grain of wheat cannot come to perfection without phos- 
 phoric acid ; this acid must come to it in combination with 
 some other substance. If this other substance is a compound 
 [as potash] that is also necessary to the growth of the wheat; 
 both are absolved, and no waste material is separated to fill 
 up the old cells of the chaff or stem. But if the phosphoric 
 acid be in combination with substance that is not essential 
 to the development of the wheat fas soda], the latter will be 
 separated as above described, or it may probably, at least to 
 some extent, remain as an impurity in the wheat. 

Analysis has shown, with a good degree of clearness, that 
 in the earlier stages of the growth of plants, all parts of the 
 plant contain nearly the same relative quantity of the differ- 
 ent inorganic materials, but as it becomes more developed,, 
 and its different organs approach perfection, certain organs 
 appropriate particular elements to themselves. Thus ripe 
 wheat appropriates nearly one-half the amount of its ash of 
 phosphoric acid, while the straw only contains about one- 
 twentieth of its amount of ash of this acid. 

Hence from the above it may be seen that when we follow 
 our soluble inorganic matter in the case of the oats sup- 
 posed, we will find its different elements separating at a cer- 
 tain period ; some we will be obliged to follow into the grain,, 
 and others into the hull and chaff that encloses and the stalk 
 that bears it, as may be seen by the following analysis of 
 ripe oats : 

Potash & Lime Magno- Chlorine Sulph. Phos. Silica, 
 soda. sia, acid, acid. 

Grain, 31.6 5..S 8.7 0.4 0.0 49.2 1.9 
 Hull, 10.3 2.0 0.4 0.3 9.6 1.0 72.8 

Chaff, 8.0 6.8 1.8 5.1 5.3 3.5 6S.1 

Leaf, 14.9 9.5 2.6 2.3 14.8 3.7 51.7 

The potash and soda are both thrown together above ; the 
 amount of soda in oats is quite insignificant, and it is not 
 present in the grain at all. 

By looking at the above numbers wo see that in the grain 
 (after it is hulled) a large quantity of potash and phosphor- 
 ic acid are present, but very little silica ; on the contrary, in 
 the hull that encloses the grain there is not so much potash 
 and very little phosphoric acid, but a great quantity of silica. 
 Adding the amount of potash and soda, of phosphoric acid 
 and of silica, in the grain and hull together, wo have 

Potash and soda, 41.9 

Phosphoric acid, 50.2 

Silica, 74.7 

166.8 
 If the 166.8 parts of potash, phosphoric acid and silica 
 above were taken in at the root of the oats, they would all 
 pass up together, as wo have described, ■nhen at the period
