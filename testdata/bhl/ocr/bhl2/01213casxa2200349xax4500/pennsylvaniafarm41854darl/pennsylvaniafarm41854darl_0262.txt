[August 

of ripening, the grain would take the phosphoric acid and 
 the principal part of the potash and soda; but having no use 
 for the silica [sand] this would bo thrown upon the most con- 
 venient organ, which from its proximity would be the hull. 
 It may be seen that the grain also robs the chaff and leaf of 
 phosphoric acid, and heaps upon them its silica. The same 
 is true of some of the other elements present in the analysis 
 as may bo seen by inspecting the numbers. 

From the foregoing it may be seen that it is no easy mat- 
 ter to decide precisely what inorganic elements are essential 
 to vegetable nutrition. And even did wo know what were 
 essential, economy might suggest the use of many combina- 
 tions, the principle part of the elements of which are not 
 essential, in order to supply one element that is. Thus we 
 can use soluble phosphate of lime to get phosphoric acid and 
 chloride, potassium to get potash, though lime and chlorine, 
 which constitute a large part of these substances, are re- 
 quired only in very small quantity by the plant. So that 
 we can have taken into the plant two substances — phosphate 
 of lime, and chloride of potassium. The plant can take the 
 phosphoric acid of the one and the potassium of the other, 
 and form (with the addition of oxygen) phosphate of pot- 
 ash. And the remaining chlorine of one and the lime of 
 the other can be separated to be thrown into the old cells, or 
 carried to the leaves to fall off with them, or according to 
 circumstances. 

We have spoken of silica (sand) as though it was of no 
 importance in the vegetable economy. This is only true 
 with regard to the development of the grain in the cases we 
 have considered. In the grasses and grass-like plants 
 (wheat, oats, timothy grass, &e.), the separated silica serves 
 the very important purpose of stiffening the straw ; yet it is 
 subject to very great variation in quantity, rendering it diflS- 
 cult to decide what quantity is best adapted to the furthest 
 development of the plant. But laying this question aside 
 for the present to return to our original one of lime and its 
 compounds, we may see by the following analysis how very 
 insignilicant is its quantity in plants compared with other 
 substances. The second column shows the amount of ash in 
 100 parts of the substances given in the first column; the 
 succeeding eight columns give the amount of potash, soda, 
 &c., in 100 parts of the ash. Thus if we have 100 pounds 
 of wheat we will get 1.978, almost two pounds, of ash, and 
 in 100 pounds of ash we will find 30.1 pounds of potash, 3 
 pounds of lime, 14.3 magnesia, &c.

The above analyses are selected principally from a great 
 number of such, given in a work on agriculture just pub- 
 lished by Dr. Emil Wolff, formerly professor of agriculture 
 in the Loipsic Economical Society, which has an extensive 
 agricultural department near this town, to which we shall 
 refer hereafter. They have been made in modern chemical 
 investigations, and are therefore not liable to be in error, in 
 consequence of the imperfect methods of earlier analyses. 

The amount of each of the above elements, contained in 
 100 bushels of each of the grains noticed, can easily be 
 found thus : 

1st. To find the ash in 100 bushels : Multiply the weight 
 of one bushel of the grain by the number standing opposite 
 to in the first perpendicular column of figures. Example : A 
 bushel of wheat weighs 60 pounds, this multiplied by 1.978 
 gives nearly 119 pounds to 100 bushels, or 1.19 to one bush- 
 el. 

2d. To find the amount of a particular constituent of the 
 ash, as potash, soda, lime, magnesia, or any other substance 
 in the last eight columns: Multiply the number which stands 
 in the column opposite the name of the grain considered 
 (and under the name of the element required) by the weight 
 of one bushel of the grain, and the product thus obtained 
 multiplied again by the number opposite the grain in the 
 first column of figures, and the last product divided by 100, 
 will give the amount of the particular substance required in 
 100 bushels. Example : To find the lime in 100 bushels of 
 wheat : Under lime, and opposite wheat, we find 3, which, 
 multiplied by the amount of one bushel, 60 lbs., gives 180, 
 and this again by the number in the first column, 1.978, 
 gives 35604, and this divided by 100 gives about three and a 
 half pounds of lime to 100 bushels of wheat. (The school 
 boy who has worked in the "single rule" can easily find the 
 amount of potash, soda, and the other elements in the wheat 
 or other substances, given by the above two rules.) 

In conclusion it must be remarked that these numbers are 
 not fixed quantities, representing the exact amount of the 
 different elements, that will in all cases be found in the anal- 
 ysis of ash; but they are the average of several analyses, 
 which differ from each other to some extent, yet they can be 
 relied upon as giving a good idea of the kind and amount of 
 the different compounds required to aid in vegetable 
 growth. E, P.

The Chief Agents of Vegetable Growth. 

BY J. S. HOUGHTON, M. D. 

Although I have written somewhat upon the subject of Ag- 
 ricultural Chemistry, I wish it to be understood by my read- 
 ers that I am not one of the ultra chemists ; nor do I consid- 
 er science so perfect and infallible a guide as to be placed 
 before and above practical knowledge ; but when science and 
 practice are combined, in due proportions, then and then only 
 can we hope for the most harmonious and successful result 
 in farming. 

Those who have not studied chemistry, are no doubt much 
 annoyed by the numerous articles containing chemical phra- 
 ses which now appear in almost all the Agricultural Jour- 
 nals; and I conceive it to be due to such readers that more 
 care should be taken by those who write, to make themselves 
 understood by persons unskilled in the use of technical terms 
 belonging to any special science. 

I propose, in this article, to present the greatest fact in 
 agricultural chemistry in a scientific, and yet popular light: 
 to remind the well informed on the subject of a grand prin- 
 ciple, which is too much lost sight of in the excitement about 
 fertilizers and manures, and to instruct those who are less 
 learned in the great fundamental principles of vegetable 
 growth.
