THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[August 

Beaping and Mowing Exhibitions. 

Being anxious to give our readers every information 
 for forming a correct judgment as to wbicli is tlie best 
 machine for mowing and reaping, to regulate their pur- 
 chases by another season, we copy the following account 
 of the trial at William Staveley's farm, in Bucks county, 
 from the Doylestown Intelligencer. Owing to the place 
 being some distance from any public communication 
 by railroad or river, several machines were not on the 
 ground. Manny's machine was more known and used 
 in that county last season than any other. 

We are also indebted to the Monmouth Enquirer for 
 the account of the Mount Holly trial and award of 
 Judges. Manny's machine, which received the first pre- 
 mium, we also hear highly favorable reports of from 
 other sections, both as a reaper and mower. We know 
 of cases near Philadelphia where it both mowed and 
 reaped beautifully, no fault being found with it in any 
 particular. Some allowance must be made this season 
 with nearly all these machines that they are new to far- 
 mers, many of whom are not mechanics, and time and 
 experience are required to understand their construction 
 and practical working. We have heard of ludicrous 
 mistakes in some places where they would not cut, such 
 as the knives being upside down, &c. Then again man- 
 ufacturers are to blame in some cases for putting them to- 
 gether of poor materials, and not guarding sufficiently 
 against wear and tear by giving the requisite strength to 
 particular parts. Nothing is more truly perplexing and 
 ■worrying than for a farmer, who had depended on his ma- 
 chine, and made no provision for hands, than to have it 
 break down, or get out of order, at the commencement 
 or in the middle of his harvest. In some cases a knife, 
 or a tooth, or a bolt, has given way, and the manufactu- 
 rer not having provided against such accidents duplicate 
 pieces could not be furnished. This has proved in the 
 recent harvest a serious and an inexcusable oversight. 
 Many machines have been thrown out of use entirely by 
 the defect and want of some trifling part. This, of 
 course, has caused some initability and worriment, iin- 
 desh-able at all times, but especially in hot weather. 
 Some machines in general, and some manufacturers in 
 particular, have been alluded to at such times in terms 
 not the smoothest and most agi-eeable that could be found 
 in the dictionary. 

We have appreciated the difficulties farmers have been 
 in, feeling the necessity of some machine for getting in 
 their harvest, by the absolute scarcity of hands, at a 
 loss which one to purchase, and their troubles with it 
 afterwards, but when all shall have been safely gathered 
 and stored in the barns there will be more time for cool 
 and considerate reflection. Manufacturers, as well as 
 farmers, have had their troubles in getting up machines 
 to supply the very unexpected demand, and we have no 
 doubt by another season many improvements in con- 
 struction will be made, and many little objections over- 
 come, which will be satisfactory all around. It should 
 be remembered that defects in construction or manufac- 
 ture are not evidences of a defective principle. The age 
 of scythes and cradles may now be said to have passed 
 very much away, and to be among the things that were. 
 The history of 1854 when written will record their exit. 
 Reaping ard mowing machines are hereafter to be a fix- 

ed fact, and specimens of the others may now be secured 
 and hung up in the different county museimis, to illus- 
 trate to a future age what barbarous and labor killing 
 instruments were wielded in the harvest field. Who 
 knows but that some future Barnum may make them 
 prominent in his cabinet of curiosities, and have to ex- 
 plain their uses to incredulous spectators. 

In our last we made the request and now renew it, 
 that those who have used mowing and reaping machines 
 the present season should forward us accounts of how 
 they performed; their objections if any, so that our rea- 
 ders may draw their own conclusions as to which is the 
 best. 

"The trial of mowers and reapers on the farm of 
 William Stavely, on the 4th inst , drew together from 
 two to three thousand spectators, chiefly farmers of 
 Bucks county, with some from adjoining counties, and 
 from New Jersey. The weather was warm, but the day 
 was fair and favorable. The mowing was done in the 
 forenoon, on a portion of Mr. Stavely's reclaimed mea- 
 dow. The ground was tolerably favorable for the work 
 — perhaps very favorable for a test of the capability of 
 the machine. It was sufficiently level and smooth to en- 
 able them to cut to advantage, and rough enough in 
 places to show that they would work on uneven ground. 
 The following machines were entered : — 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, improved, of 1851 — en- 
 tered by Adrian Cornell; Northampton. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, improved, of 1853 — en- 
 tered by the same. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, improved — entered by 
 Good & Gillingham, of Solebury and Buckingham. 

Allen's Mower — entered by George Goslin, of New- 
 port ville. 

Allen's Mower — entered by C. B. Rogers, of Philadel- 
 phia. 

Hallenback's Mower, with sickle-edged cutters — enter- 
 ed by Alfred Baker, of Newtown. 

Hallenback's Mower, with smooth-edged cutters — en- 
 tered by the same. 

Wilson & Moore's Mower — entered by Wilson & Moore, 
 inventors, of Yardleyville. 

McCormick's Mower and Reaper — entered by R. T. 
 Elkinton, 53 S. Del. Av., Philadelphia. 

Ruggs' Mower and Reaper — entered by W, & C. Crook, 
 New Hope. 

Bean's improved Mower— entered by Comly Hampton, 
 of Warminster. 

Each machine had a space measured oflF for a task, 
 and at near 11 o'clock they commenced operations. 

Wilson & Moore's machine cut one round, and then 
 broke down, or some part of the machinery gave way, 
 requiring repair before proceeding. After a good deal 
 of delay, it was started again, and soon broke down a 
 second time, and was abandoned. This machine is some- 
 thing new, got up at Yardleyville, for mowing only, and 
 being the first one made, it was constructed without 
 sufficient regard to strength in parts where severe strains 
 would come upon it. It is exceedingly simple in its 
 construction ; and from the ease and beautiful manner 
 with which it performed its work, it is evident that it 
 may be made one of the best mowers now out. We saw
