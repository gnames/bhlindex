no work better done by any other machine. 

Hallenback's mower is one of the simplest in construc- 
 tion that we saw ; in fact, it would seem impossible to 
 dispense with any of the machinery about it. It i-uns 
 easy and does its work in a superior manner. 

Rugg's Mower and Reaper is essentially different from 
 all the others, except in the cutting apparatus, which is 
 alike in all of them. It is more complicated than some 
 of the other machines, has much more weight of mate- 
 rial, occupies more space, and is not so readily managed 
 in turning about. The horses are placed behind the 
 cutting apparatus, by which the side draught is avoided, 
 and the driver sits behind them, guiding the machine by 
 a sort of rudder wheel underneath his seat. It has some 
 advantages and some disadvantages, as compared with 
 others. It appeared to us to require more power to 
 drive it than others ; while it cuts a wider swath than 
 most of them. It does its work pretty well. 

The other machines we did not have an opportunity of 
 observing particularly ; and can only say that they all 
 did their work as well or better thau we had expected. 
 The side draught is one of the greatest objections to the 
 mowing machines ; and we believe none of them are 
 clear of it except Ruggs'. We do not know, however, 
 that, in getting rid of it in that machine, as much is not 
 lost in some other respects. We would advise farmers 
 who are about to purchase, to examine as many different 
 kinds of mowers as practicable, and see them work, be- 
 fore making a selection. We do not think that any one 
 machine combines the best qualities for mowing and 
 reaping to so great an extent as those adapted to one or 
 the other operation alone. 

From an examination of the several performances the 
 Committee concluded to make the following awards : 

To Alfred Blaker, Newtown, Ten Dollars. 
 " W. & C. Crook, New Hope, Ten Dollars. 
 " R. T. Elkinton, Philadelphia, Ten Dollars. 
 " George Goslin, Newportville, Ten Dollars. 

The reaping was done in the afternoon, in a field of 
 wheat of fair size, and standing thick upon the ground. 
 The machines entered were as follows : 

McCormick's Mower and Reeper, of 1851 — entered by 
 Oliver Balderston, of Solebury. 

McCormick's Mower and Reaper, of 1854 — entered by 
 R. T. Elkinton, Philadelphia. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, 1851, and Manny's Mower 
 and Reaper, 1853 — entered by Adrian Cornell, of North- 
 ampton. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper — entered by Good & Gill- 
 ingham, of Solebury and Buckingham. 

Rugg's Mower and Reaper — entered by W. & C. Crook, 
 New Hope. 

All these machines cut the grain well enough, though 
 gome did it rather better than others — cleaner and with 
 less straggling stalks. In fact, they all cut cleaner than 
 a common cradle, and some of them scarcely left a stalk 
 ungathered in their tracks. The superiority of some 
 over others consisted chiefly in the greater ease of work- 
 ing, or the neater and more regular manner of their de- 
 livery of the grain after cutting. Much of this depends 
 upon the skill and experience of those who remove the 
 grain ; but it cannot be denied that the construction of 
 the machine has much to do with it also. One or two of 

the machines left the grain in pretty neat and regular 
 bunches for binding ; while others left it in more irregu- 
 lar masses, with many stalks scattered between. We 
 think, as a reaper alone, the sentiment of the spectators 
 preponderated in favor of McCormick's machine worked 
 by Oliver Balderston. The committee also gave the pre- 
 ference to this mower, and awarded Mr. B. the premium 
 of twenty dollars. They also awarded to Adrian Cornell, 
 twenty dollars, for Manny's Reaper and Mower com- 
 bined, as the best one exhibited."

The Committee appointed to have charge of the exhi- 
 bition and trial of Mowing and Reaping Machines, pre- 
 sent the following report : 

We selected grass and grain growing on land in the 
 possession of Samuel A. Dobbins, near Mount Holly, 
 and fixed Saturday, July 1st, as the time for the exhibi- 
 tion aiid trial. Upon that day, which was as fine as 
 could be desired, a large number of persons were in at- 
 tendance. Of those present, many were from a distance, 
 showing that persons engaged in agriculture are keenly 
 alive to the gathering of haj' and grain by machinery, 
 which has ceased to be a matter of experiment, and in 
 many localities become a work of dire necessity. Your 
 committee, desirous of making the trial of machines the 
 most beneficial to all interested, determined to give each 
 machine, so far as they were able, a fair and equal 
 chance. The grass was timothy and red clover, very 
 large, and in many places much down and tangled. The 
 grain was wheat, and most of it quite tall and heavy — 
 the ground somewhat uneven. The grass staked off in 
 lots of about one-fourth of an acre each, and numbered 
 — each person entering, drew for a lot, and took the one 
 corresponding to the number drawn. 

We had the pleasure of finding on the ground, and 
 entered for competition, the following machines, viz : 

McCormick's Mower and Pteaper of 1854, by Lloyd J. 
 Hunt. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper of 1854, by John Poin- 
 sett. 

Manny's Improved Mower and Reaper, by Elisha and 
 Edwin Roberts. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper of 1853, by Tylee W. 
 Burr. 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, with Wood's improve- 
 ment, by Hartshorne White. 

^fanny's Mower and Reaper of 1854, by Joseph 
 Smith. 

Ketchum's Mower of 1854, by J. Brown. 

Ketchum's Mower of 1854, by D. Zelley. 

Ketchum's Mower of 1853, by Thomas Herbert. 

Allen's Mower of 1853, by Stacy B. Lippincott. 

Allen's Mower, by John E. Deacon. 

Allen's Mower, by Clayton B. Rogers. 

Manny's Mower, with Wood's improvement, by Jerome 
 & Ellison. 

All of which took part in the mowing contest. 

Each machine was allowed two persons to operate 
 with : one to drive the team, and another to render such 
 assistance as was deemed necessary. Every machine 
 was required to cut a double first, and then the operator 
 to cut out his lot at his own discretion. Each machine
