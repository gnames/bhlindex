with circumstances similar to this and even more diffi- 
 cult to be explained, without being at all shaken in their 
 belief in the all sufficiency of Nature's laws. 

There is one conclusion to which I think farmers ought 
 to come, fi-om the circumstance related by Mr. M., i. e. 
 to take the advice of Dr. Franklin, 

"Plow deep while sluggards sleep — " 
 and never depend upon a volunteer crop. "An enemy" 
 is always ready to volunteer, and sow tares in our wheat. 
 Without doubting a single word Avhich the gentleman 
 has stated as fact, permit me to lay his "conclusion" 
 aside for the present, and in as few words as justice to 
 the subject will admit, investigate this case a little 
 further, before throwing the blame of ill success, conse- 
 quent upon careless or slovenly farming, upon Dame 
 Nature. It is a well known principal, that rotation of 
 crops, is as well the natural as the proper method of 
 farming; — that a piece of ground may be entirely ex- 
 hausted of some necessary ingredient for the production 
 of a certain kind of grain, and yet rich enough to pro- 
 duce a crop of another kind. It is also well known, to 
 practical farmers, that rye and cheat follow wheat; — 
 that a field which will not produce wheat at all, will 
 produce a good ci"op of rye or cheat, without any ma- 
 nure. Is it not then most probable that in Mr. Dres- 
 back's first crop of wheat, there was a little cheat ? 
 There is a little in many a fine crop. That the ground 
 being in proper condition for wheat, which it must have 
 been, the cheat was kept down by it, that it scarcely 
 shows at all; but, the crop being left till "quite ripe," 
 the cheat, which falls out more easily than wheat, nearly 
 or quite all fell to the ground, and sprung up with the 
 wheat. The soil having just producd a heavj' crop of 
 wheat, was now in a condition to admit the two grains 
 upon a more equal footing, and the cheat probably 
 gained upon the wheat; but the latter having the advan- 
 tage in numbers, still kept above it, and produced a 
 tolerably good crop. Certainly not as good as the first, 
 but it was a volunteer, and under the circumstances it 
 might be called a very good crop; true there is a little cheat 
 in it, but that can be cleaned out, and so the matter was 
 settled that it was a fine crop. This again was permit- 
 ted to become very ripe in order to seed the ground for 
 a third, and again a considerable quantity of the cheat 
 fell to the ground, which, having just produced, without 
 cultivation, one and a half crops of wheat, and only 
 about half a crop or less of cheat, gave the preponder- 
 ance decidedly to the latter, which sprung up and gave 
 the farmer just what he deserved, and what any observ- 
 ant farmer would, without calling the ghost of Samuel, 
 certainly have looked for — a crop of cheat with "scarce- 
 ly a head of wheat." 

Now, Mr, Editor, is it at all fair for a farmer, after 
 having been guilty of such palpable neglect upon his 
 part, to endeavor, without any further investigation than 
 that which he has given, to endeavor to throw the blame 
 of his non-success upon some imperfection in the laws 
 of nature, and to bring up a sort of philosophy to prove 
 that he is right and nature wrong? But, let us examine 
 a little u-hat sort of philosophy he has produced. 

lie says "there are freaks of nature, and it is not 
 moi-e contrarj' to the principles of philosophj', nor to the 
 agency of Divine Providence, to find an entire field of 
 wheat turning to cheat, than a single stalk." This we 
 will admit. But who has ever seen a "single stalk of 
 wheat turning to cheat?" That is the question ! There 

are freaks of nature, or, rather, nature is sometimes 
 forced to submit to unnatural freaks of sociability, both 
 in the vegetable and animal kingdoms; the inevitable 
 result of which is monstrosity. But cheat is not a 
 monster ! Monsters have not the power of re-produc- 
 tion, and that cheat has, is a fact so easily proved, that 
 no farmer ought to contradict or even doubt it for a 
 longer time than a single year. An experiment of a 
 few hours labor, during the year, v.'ill be sufficient to 
 convince any body, that cheat produces its own kind as 
 naturally as any other grain. Hence the error in the 
 statement that "it is not more of a freak of nature for a 
 stalk of wheat to turn to cheat than for a child to be 
 born with the head of a horse." When the Northum- 
 berland philosopher points us to a child with the head 
 of a horse, possessing sufficient vitality to bring it to 
 maturity and enable it to re-produce its own kind so aa 
 to people a country with children with horses heads, 
 then will we be constrained to admit that the cases are 
 analagous I That creative power is still emerging upon 
 earth, that the "six days" have not yet expired, and 
 consequently the scriptural statement that God "ended 
 His work on the seventh" is a mistake, or else that His 
 laws are confounded, and that confusion and chaos 
 must soon cover the face of this fair earth. The phi- 
 losopher thinks his statement "shows conclusively that 
 there is an affinity between wheat and cheat" because, 
 without producing either monster or mongrel, the wheat 
 perished and the cheat grew and flourished. Now, ad- 
 mitting that there were affinity between the two grains, 
 sufficient to produce both upon the same stalk, wlienever 
 they came into close contact, which we are not at all pre- 
 pared to do, it Avould be no ai-gument in favor of any one 
 kind of grain alone changing into another known kind. 
 Therefore, we still believe in our motto, "Clean seed 
 upon clean soil, and a clean harvest will follow."

Large Hogs. 

Mr. Daklixgtox: — In the June number of your .Jour- 
 nal a correspondent, who signs himself H. J., gives an 
 account of some Chester county hogs, which is very 
 good. First he tells you that he is not boasting about 
 them ; but I think at the winding up he is boasting 
 very largely. We farmers of Gloucester county do not 
 consider ourselves the best in the State for raising large 
 hogs, but I will tell you what was done last killing 
 time, in the adjoining (Burlington) county, where they 
 do profess to raise large hogs. 

The following is an exact account of two pens of hogs 
 and pigs raised and fattened on one farm. First: — 400, 
 400, 412, 448, 458, 490, 554, 520, 430, 510, 444, 470, 
 500, 520, 480, 520, 45G, 530, 408, 455, 485, 506, 457, 
 470, 424. 478, 475, 457, 423, 485, 400, 453 360, 400, 
 382, 308, 390, 415, 352, 378, 418, 338, 370, 455, 358, 
 455, 445, 388, 380, 388, 448, 470, 510, 497, 433, 390, 
 400, 443, 398, 440, 430, 481, 500, 473, 465, 4G8, 478, 
 466, 532, 430, 438, 426, 470, 482, 532. Total, 33,495. 
 Second pen, of late Spring pigs:— 262, 258, 238, 350, 
 204, 260, 278, 246, 256, 250, 328, 242, 204, 232, 244, 
 224, 240, 280, 290. 260, 220, 270, 216, 250. 228, 282, 
 242. 250. Total, 7,104. Whole weight of both pens, 
 40,599 pounds, from one hundred and three hogs.
