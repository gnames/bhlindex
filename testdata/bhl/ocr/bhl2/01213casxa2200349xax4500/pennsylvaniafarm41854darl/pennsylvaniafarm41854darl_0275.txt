An Offer. 

We have had it in comtemplation for some time past 
 to introduce female compositors into this office, and now 
 that our new building and other arrangements are com- 
 pleted propose to engage two female assistants in the 
 composition and packing depax'tments. As most of our 
 lady readers may be unacquainted with this branch of 
 industry, we will state that the labor is light, and pecu- 
 liarly adapted to female hands. The exertion required 
 is, in no case, greater than in ordinary sewing, but it is 
 far more healthy and agreeable. What is most essential 
 is an accurate knowledge of orthography, and a quick 
 comprehension, united to habits of industry. 

Apprentices to the printing business are seldom taken 
 for less than three years, but in order to bring our offer 
 as near the condition of females as possible, we will con- 
 tract this period to one year, during which we think 
 an intelligent lady can acquire a thorough knowledge of 
 the compositor's art ; and we hazard little in stating, 
 that, at the end of this period, she can obtain from a 
 dollar to a dollar and a half per day. Press work, 
 which, a few years back, was an important branch ne- 
 cessarily learned by all printers, is now chiefly done by 
 machinerj', and few compositors have latterly acquired a 
 knowledge of this part of the trade. 

Any further information desired will be furnished by 
 application to the publishers in person or by letter.

RETIRE FROM THE CITY TO ENJOY RURAL LIFE 

When Mrs. Sparrowgrass and I moved into the coimtry 
 with our heads full of fresh butter, and cool, crisp radishes 
 for tea ; with ideas entirely lucid respecting milk, and a 
 looseness of calculation as to the number in a family it 
 would take a good laying hen to supply with fresh eggs eve- 
 ry morning; when Mrs. Sparrowgrass and I moved into the 
 country, we found some preconceived notions had to be 
 abandoned, and some departures made from the plans we 
 had laid down in the little back parlor in avenue G. 

One of the first achievements in the country is early ri- 
 sing ! with the lark — with the sun — while the dew is on the 
 grass," under the opening eye-lids of the morn," and so forth. 
 Early rising. — What can be done with five or six o'oclock in 
 town ? What may not be done with those hours in the coun- 
 try ? With the hoe, and rake, the dibble, the spade, the wat- 
 tering pot ? To plant, prune, drill, transplant, graft, train, 
 and sprinkle ? Mrs.S. and I agreed to rise early in the coun- 
 try. 

"Richard and Robin were two pretty men, 
 They laid in bed till the clock struck ten : 
 Up jumped Richard and looked at the sky : 
 brother Robin the sun's very high !" 

Early rising in the country is not an instinct ; it is a sen- 
 timent, and must be cultivated. 

A friend recomonded me to send to the south side of Long 
 Island for some very prolific potatoes — the real hippopota- 
 mus breed. Down went my man, and what with expence of 
 horse hire, tavern bUls, toll gates, and breaking a wagon, the 
 hippopotami cost as much apiece as pine apples. They 
 were fine potatoes though, with comely features, and large, 
 languishing ej'es, that promised increase of family without de- 
 lay. As I worked my own garden, (for which I hired a land- 
 scape gardener at two dollers per day to give mo instructions) 
 I concluded that the object of my first experience in early 
 rising should be the planting of the hippopotamuses. I ac- 
 cordingly rose next morning at five, and it rained 1 I rose 
 next day at five, and it rained ! The next, and it rain- 
 ed! It rained for two weeks! Wo had splendid potatoes ev- 
 ery day for dinner. "My dear said I to Mrs. Sparrow- 
 grass, "where did you get these fine potatoes?" "Why said 
 she innocently, "out of that basket from Long Island !" 
 The last of the hippopotamuses were before me, pealed and 
 boiled and ma«hed and baked, with a nice thin brown crust 
 on the top. 

I was more successful afterward. I did got some fine seed 

potatoes in the ground. But something was the matter ; at 
 the end of the season I did not get as many as I put in. 

Mrs. Sparrowgrass, who is a notable house wife, said to 
 me one day,"Now my dear, we shall soon have plenty of eggs, 
 for I have been buying a lot of young chickens." There 
 they were, each one with as many feathers as a grasshoper, 
 and a chirp not louder. Of course, we looked forward with 
 pleasant hopes to the period when the first cackle should an- 
 nounce the milk white egg, in the hay, which we had provi- 
 ded bountifully. They grew finely, one day I ventured to 
 remark that our hens had remarkable large combs, to which 
 Mrs. S. replied, "Yes, indeed, she had observed that; but if 
 I wanted to have a real treat, I ought to get up early in the 
 morning and hear them crow. "Crow," said I faintly, "our 
 hens crowing! Then by 'the cock that crowed in the morn, 
 to wake the priest all shaven and shorn, we might as well 
 give up all hopes of having eggs," said I, "for, as sure as 
 you live, Mrs. S., our hens are all roosters !" And so they 
 were roosters ! that grow up and fought with the neighbor's 
 chickens, until there was not a whole pair of eyes on either 
 side of the fence. 

A dog is a good thing to have in the country. I have one 
 which I raised from a pup. He is a good, stout fellow, and 
 a hearty barker and feeder. The man of whom I bought 
 him, said he was thorough bred, but he begins to have a mon- 
 grel look about him. He is a good watch dog though, for 
 the moment he sees any suspicious looking person about the 
 premises he comes right into the kitchen and gets behind 
 the stove. First we kept him in the house, and he scratched 
 all night to get out. Then wo turned him out.and ho scratch- 
 ed all night to get in. Then we tied him up at the back of 
 the garden, and he howled so that our neighbors shot at him 
 twice before daybreak. Finally we gave him away, and 
 he came back; and now he is just recovering from a fit, in 
 which he has torn up the patch that had been sowed for our 
 spring radishes. 

A good strong gate is necssary article for your garden. A 
 good, strong, heavy gate, with a dislocated hinge, so that it 
 will neither open nor shut. Such an one as I had last year. 
 The grounds before my fence are in common, and all the 
 neighbor's cows pasture there. I remarked to Mrs. S., as we 
 stood at the window in Juno last, how placid and picturesque 
 the cattle looked, as they strolled about, cropping the green 
 herbage. Next morning I found the innocent creatures in 
 my garden. They had not left a green thing in it. The corn 
 in the milk, the beans on the poles, the young cabbage, the 
 tender lettuce, even the thriving shoots of my fruit trees had 
 vanished. And there they were looking quietly on the ruin 
 they had made. Our watch dog, too, as fore-gathering with 
 them. It was too much, so I got a large stick and drove them 
 all out, except a young heifer, whom I chased all over the 
 flower-beds, breaking down my trellises, my woodbines and 
 and sweet-briers, my roses, and petunias, until I cornered 
 her in the hot-bed. I had to call assistance to extricate her 
 from the sashes, and her owner sued me for damages and 
 recovered. I think I shall move back to town. — Knicker-

 Road Wash. 

Mr. Editor: — Every means for enriching the soil should 
 be attended to by the farmer, to whom the business is often 
 one of considerable expense and trouble. It is well known 
 that a very large quantity of valuable manure is annually 
 dropped in the highways, where it is carried by the rains, 
 into the ditches and gullies which ordinarily skirt the trav- 
 eled way. Now this rich matter may o'^ten be conveyed into 
 fields simply by opening proper drains and erecting slight 
 dams to facilitate its flow over the lauds where its presence 
 is most needed. It is seldom the case that a farmer's lands 
 are so peculiarly situated as not to admit of his availing him- 
 self of this valuable wash to some extent. I have knufrn ex- 
 tensive fields kept in good heart simply by the wa.sh from 
 the highway, and where every person whose situation favors 
 the undertaking, to exert himself to secure this li-juid wealth, 
 a very important general saving would be the result It 
 sometimes happens that a deep gxdley, or hole by the side of 
 the road, receives the spring wash, and gradually becomes 
 filled with a deposit of the richest and most valuable manure. 
 Whore this is the case, it is an excellent plan to cart into such 
 places a quantity of loam or good muck to absorb the liquid, 
 and thus add to the quantity which can afterwards be carted 
 out and applied as circumstances may demand. I have known
