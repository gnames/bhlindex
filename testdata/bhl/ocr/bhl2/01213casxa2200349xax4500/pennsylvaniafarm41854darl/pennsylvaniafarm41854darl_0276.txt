large quantities of excellent compost to be made in this way 
 and at very slight expense. All the refuse matter about the 
 farm buildings may here be wrought up to good advantage, 
 as well as the spurious or worthless vegetations of the fields, 
 pastures and even woodlands. Rotten leaves, rotten wood, 
 bushes, brakes, chip manure — in short anything that will de- 
 compose may here be deposited and remain till time breaks 
 down the fibrous texture, and by the assistance of the peri- 
 odical influx of the wash, converts the whole into a valuable 
 manure for the soil. Such places are often more favorably 
 adapted for the prosecution of this business, than the barn or 
 compost yards ; the materials to be converted into manure 
 are not out of the way, and present no obstacle to the pros- 
 ecution of other employments; besides, they are receiving 
 continuous accessions from a source, the wealth of which is 
 to be regarded, strictly speaking, as an actual gain. 

Farmers will find this subject worthy of serious considera- 
 tion in the business of enriching their lands and crops. 

One Who Knows. 

Why don't Ladies Learn to Cook. 

Among the common things to the teaching of which pub- 
 lic attention is now so strongly directed, it is to be hoped that 
 the art of cookery — one of the commonest, and yet, apparent- 
 ly, one of the most neglected of all — will not be forgotten. — 
 The instruction of the female peasantry in this useful art 
 would be as advantageous to themselves when married and 
 settled on their own hearths, as to the families of the middle 
 classes, in which before marriage they officiate as domestic 
 servants. Emigration and .abundance of employment have 
 given to the servants at home the upporhand as completely 
 as if they were in Australia. On all sides we hear complaints 
 of the difiieulty of finding, and of retaining when found, a 
 cook who can roast a leg of mutton, and make batter pud- 
 ding or pea-soup. In point of fact, we have heard of ladies 
 who have it in serious contemplation to dispense with ser- 
 vants altogether, as the least troublesome alternative. With- 
 out wishing matters carried quite so far, we are convinced 
 that many of our fair friends would lose nothing, either in 
 point of respectability or happiness, while they could add at 
 least one-third to the effective incomes of their husbands, if 
 they were to spend a little more time in theirkitchens super- 
 intending the preparation of the family dinner, instead of 
 contenting themselves with ordering it — if, indeed, they con- 
 descended to do even that. Some forty years back ladies 
 were driven to shoemaking as a fashionable way of killing 
 time. Why not try a little cooking? Thanks to the modern 
 stoves with their nicely arranged skillets and stewpans, which 
 science and skill have subsituted for the blazing kitchen 
 hearth of other d.ays, young ladies of the nineteenth century 
 just passing its prime, may cook without soiling their fingers 
 or injuring their complexions. Were it not so, we would not 
 recommend them to cook. AVe would rather live on bread 
 and cheese all our lives. 

It will be said, perhaps, that our notions with regard to 
 female education and employment are too antiquated — that 
 in these matters, as in everything else, anew era has dawned, 
 and the solid course of instruction now given in colleges for 
 ladies will be triumphantly appealed to. Ladies, however, 
 who possess these solid acquirements — who like Lady J.ane 
 Grey, prefer Plato to a pic-nic — will be least likely to neg- 
 lect the economy of the kitchen. They will thoroughly un- 
 derstand the dignity of the employment, and call to mind all 
 the poetry of cooking. To say nothing of the dinner which 
 Milton describes Eve as preparing when "on hospitable 
 thoughts intent," there are the Homeric banquets, at which 
 kings literally "killed their own meat," and atwhich queens 
 and princesses turned the spit for the roasting, or drew the 
 ■water and chopped wood for the boiling. Cooking is classical, 
 and no lady will disdain to take part in it who has read of these 
 feasts in the original Greek. Let it be observed that it is the 
 middle .and wroking classes on whom we wish to urge the im- 
 portance of the study. An earl's daughter can afford to be so 
 ignorant of common thingsasnottobe able to recognize chick- 
 ens in a poultry-yard, because they do not run about with a 
 liver under one wing and a gizzard under the other, though 
 our modern poultry shows, it must be confessed, have done 
 much to dissipate this error. A knowledge, however, of the art 
 of cooking is of more importance to the wives of the laboring 
 population than to those of the middle classes, because it is 
 the art, when properly cultivated, of making a little go a 
 great way. A French army can subsist in a country where 
 an English one would starve, and chiefly for this reason — a 
 French soldier can cook. — [Mark-Lane Express. 

Culture of the Cranberry. 

The culture of this fruit is beginning to demand some at- 
 tention in Maine, but the best method of doing it among us, 
 is yet a problem to be solved by many experiments and 
 much observation. We have two facts to start upon. Th« 
 first is this : The cranberry is indigenous in, that is to say a 
 native of, our low lands, growing naturally in many places 
 from Kittery to Calais, and from Harpswell to Madawasca. 
 The second fact is this : on whatever soil it may be placed, 
 a good supply of water is necessary to its growth and pro- 
 ductiveness. 

There are two other facts that should be remembered in 
 regard to the culture of this fruit, namelj', it has two ene- 
 mies which often destroy the crop. One of them is a worm 
 which attacks it about flowering time and eats it so badly ae 
 to prevent any fruit from forming. The other is frost. La- 
 ter spring frosts often kill the flowers and prevent fruit from 
 forming, and early fall frosts injure the fruit that has es- 
 caped the other enemies. 

One more fact should be remembered, namely, in Massa- 
 chusetts it has been found that flowing the land from the 
 time of gathering, say the middle of October till May, and 
 if the worm comes, flow again, prevent his operation, and 
 also the effect of late spring frosts, and occasional flowing in 
 the fall when early frosts are expected, will prevent the in- 
 jury which such frosts do the fruit. 

We do not mean that the water should be laid on so as to 
 put the vines under water "forty fathom," as a sailor would 
 say, but suificiently to keep the vines out of the way of the fly 
 that lays the egg from which the worm comes. Mr. Leland, of 
 Sherborn, Mass., as reported in the transactions of the Massa- 
 chusetts Agricultural Societies for 1853, says : "To destroy 
 the worms the vines were kept under water from spring to 
 the first of July." This destroyed all the worms. When 
 the water was taken off the vines grew vigorously, forming 
 the buds for the (succeeding) year, and a handsome crop 
 was the result. 

Mr. Flint, of North Reading, says : flow from October to 
 May, or until vegetiition starts, then lower it down to the 
 top of the vines, and keep it on them thus until the spring 
 frosts are over, then let the vines fairly out of water till the 
 vines are grown, say middle of August, then draw it off for 
 ripening and milking. 

Cranberries are raised on moist upland, sandy loams, but 
 wet boggy land where you can lay the water on and off at 
 your pleasure, is the best chance for them. — Maine Farmer. 

The Potato Disease. 

After a series of lengthened investigations upon this sub- 
 ject by several members of the British Meteorological Soe'y, 
 the following conclusions were arrived at: 

That the vital energy of the potato is unimpared, and that it 
 never becomes diseased until the stage of flowering, which is 
 about one hundred days, or about three months, from the 
 time of planting ; that the causes are simultaneous in their 
 action over a large tract of country, and at greater distance 
 and are peculiar to the soil and air. The conditions of the 
 former are too rich and too much manure, too poor soils, and 
 such as are moist and clayey; and on the latter barometrical 
 and thermal states and hygrometical condition, withsouth- 
 ern directions of the wind and atmospheric zone. That the 
 object of the agriculturist ought to be the proper cultivation of 
 the soil, and endeavor, to economisethe vital power of the plant 
 at the time of flowering ; and the removal of the flower he- 
 fore the formation of the seed would seem to contribute to this 
 end. 

Action and Ee-action in Farming. 

Never keep animals on short allowance — if you starve 
 them, they will surely starve you. 

Although in draining land thoroughly your purse may be 
 drained, yet the full crops that follow will soon fill it again. 

Always give the soil the first meal. If this is well fed 
 with manure, it will feed all else ! plants, animals and men. 

Heavy carrot crops for cattle, will soon return carats of 
 gold. 

Fences operate in two ways — if good they are a fence, if 
 poor an offence. 

Many a farmer, by too sparingly seeding his meadows, 
 has had to seed his whole farm. 

Every farmershould see daily every animal he h,as, and in- 
 spect its condition. Weekly visits, as is the case with some, 
 soon result in weakly animals.
