Farmers' High School of f ennsylvania. 

[We ask the attention of the farmers of Pennsylvania to 
 the following proceedings of the Board of Trustees of the 
 Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania, and the address of 
 the Committee.] 

Meeting of the Trustees. — In pursuance of the Act of 
 Incorporation a few of the persons designated by the act as 
 Trustees, met at Harrisburg on the 13th of June, 1854, for 
 the purpose of considering its provisions. The members 
 present did not constitute a quorum of the Board. The 
 Hon. Geo. W. Woodward presented the following resolu- 
 tion which was agreed to : — 

Resolved, That Frederick Watts, James Gowen and 
 John Strohm be a committee whose duty it shall be to re- 
 port to the next meeting of the Board of Trustees a plan of 
 organization for the Farm School of Pennsylvania, with 
 such modifications of the Charter and such Legislative ap- 
 propriations as may ho deemed advisable to apply for next 
 winter. 

The Board then adjourned to meet at Harrisburg, in the 
 room of the State Society, on Thursday, the 13th of July, at 
 2 o'clock, P. M., of which meeting it was directed that each 
 member of the Board should have personal notice. 

Adjourxed Meeting. — Thursday, the 13th of July, 1854. 
 There were present, Messrs. Watts, of Cumberland, Mcmma 
 and RuTHERFonD, of Danphin, McIlvaine, of Chester, 
 BoAL, of Centre, and Baxter, of Phil.adelphia; there being 
 no other member of the committee appointed at the last 
 meeting present but the Chairman, he submitted the follow- 
 ing Report: — 

The Committee to whom was referred the subject of the 
 organization of the "Farmers' High School of Pennsyl- 
 vania," are of opinion that no good would result from any 
 effort to organize under the existing law. It is radically de- 
 fective in two particulars : — First, in providing for a Board 
 of Trustees composed of fifty or sixty members, many of 
 whom are subject to constant removal by events having no 
 reference to the interests of the institution, and living at so 
 great a distance from any point that there could be no hope 
 of getting them together to act at any time. Inasmuch as 
 any service to be rendered by a Trustee must be wholly gra- 
 tuitous, it cannot bo expected that individuals will make sa- 
 crifices so great as the provisions of this bill demand. The 
 Board should not consist of more than thirteen members, of 
 whom the Governor, Secretary of the Commonwealth, At- 
 torney General and President of the State Agricultural So- 
 ciety should be members cx-officio Nine should be named 
 in the bill. The term of service of three of these should ex- 
 pire at the end of each year, whose place may be supplied 
 by the election of three others, by the Executive Committee 
 of the State Society. This Executive Committee is com- 
 posed of the officers of the Society, who by its charter are 
 elected by the members and taken from each congressional 

district, thus covering the whole ground and all local inter- 
 ests of the State. We know not where the responsibility of 
 such election may be more safely reposed. 

But the bill is defective because it makes no appropriation 
 in aid of the project. There are many public spirited men 
 in the State who believe that the establishment of a School 
 where boys may be educated for Farmers is of more impor- 
 tance than any design which could occupy public attention. 
 It ia a fact universally known that the literary institutions 
 of the country, as at present constituted, educate young men- 
 to a state of total unfitness, not only for the pursuits of a- 
 farmer but as a campanion for his parents, brothers and sis- 
 ters, with whom he is expected to spend his life. He is,, 
 therefore, driven from them — from his father's estate — and. 
 into a profession fur which he has perhaps little capacity,, 
 and where he is subjected to all the temptations of an idle- 
 life. Whereas the Farm School proposes to impart an edu- 
 cation which is appropriate to a Farmer, which educates his 
 body to the art as well as his mind to the science of farm- 
 ing, and which will have the feature of making the Institu- 
 tion so nearly self-sustaining as to bring education, in point 
 of expense, within the reach of every man who desires to 
 make his son an educated Farmer. 

It is within the scope of our duty to make plain, through: 
 the medium of figures, a plan for the attainment of this ob-- 
 ject: 

A Farm of 300 acres at $60 would cost, _$18 000 

Additional buildings 10 000 

Stock and Implements, 5 000 

Furniture, Books, Instruments, 6 000 

Contingencies, 1 000

 Let the State appropriate, in annual instal- 
 ments of $4,000, $20 000 

Appropriation of State Society, 10 000 

Mortgage Loan, 10 000 

$40 000 
 To support the School will cost : 

Salary of Principal, $2 500 

Two other Professors, 3 000 

One other Professor, 1 200 

To sustain the Institution annually, 10 000 

$16 700 

Annual appropriation of State Society, $5 000 

200 Pupils at $75 each, 15 000
