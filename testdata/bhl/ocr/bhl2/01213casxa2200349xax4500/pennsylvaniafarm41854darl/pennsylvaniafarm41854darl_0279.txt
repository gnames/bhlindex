tanic and tungstic acids, and its artificially prepared com- 
 pounds with acids, which are known to chemists, are reck- 
 oned by hundreds, but the above six are sufficient for our 
 consideration. The first is most abundant ; the third and 
 fourth the most valuable to the farmer as affording phos- 
 phoric acid to the wheat crops, &c.; the sixth is very rare 
 in nature but is easily prepared artificially, it is the most 
 soluble compound in the list, and on this account has been 
 recommended as a source of lime to plants, but this is a 
 matter of little importance since any of the compounds are 
 soluble enough to let the most of plants, if not all of them, 
 have the small per centage required by them. So far as the 
 wants of the plant for lime are concerned, there is no better 
 source than the usual method of applying caustic lime. 

If the above six compounds be heated to redness, they 
 will give quite different results ; the first and sixth will 
 be decomposed, the first giving off carbonic acid gas and the 
 sixth giving off nitric acid, and both leaving in the kiln 
 pure lime ; the second, third, fourth and fifth will not give 
 off their acids by heating; the second is somewhat soluble 
 in water (one part soluble in 500 of water), and may, there- 
 fore, enter the plant in combination with its acid as it does 
 when used in top-dressing, &c. Thus applied it also sup- 
 plies sulphuric acid to the plant, which is essential to its 
 growth. The third and fourth are to the farmer the most 
 valuable, as presenting a source of phosphoric acid, which 
 is one of the most important compounds in the inorganic 
 part of plants, no planf ever being found without it ; but this 
 compound of phosphoric acid is so very insoluble that it 
 must enter the plant exceedingly slowly, yet oven in this in- 
 soluble state it is not so worthless as some chemists, who 
 considering its solubilitity in pure water, have supposed. 
 Almost every one who has any experience in practical farm- 
 ing knows that ground bones, insoluble as they are, are of 
 great use to crops ; but what is much better is a compound of 
 phosphoric acid and less lime. By removing one-third or 
 two-thirds, or all the lime from the phosphate of lime, we 
 get a substance quite soluble. This removal is accomplish- 
 ed bj' dissolving bones, or apatite, in sulphuric acid, a pro- 
 cess adopted by those who make artificial "superphos- 
 phates," "biphosphates," &c. The lime which was previously 
 in combination with the phosphoric acid, will be found 
 in union with the sulphuric acid, forming a substance 
 identical with the second, and this latter substance must, 
 as a necessary result of the method of its formation, be 
 found in mechanical mixture with the aforesaid so called 
 superphosphate. The silicate of lime (5) is of liitle impor- 
 tance to the agriculturist ; it exists abundantly in nature in 
 very insoluble combinations. 

Certain kinds of lime, when heated too hot in burning, 
 become "dead burned." This is due to the presence of fine 
 sand (silica) being disseminated through the mass, and when 
 it is heated to the melting point of this mixture of lime and 
 silica, they enter into chemical unison (being only mechani- 
 cally mixed before), forming insoluble silicate of lime. 

No heat has ever been obtained capable of producing an 
 insoluble state in pure lime. Lime may also have so much 
 sand in it, and this so coarse that it will not bo possible to 
 get it hot enough to produce this dead burnt lime. There 
 are examples of both kinds in Chester county. 

The analysis given in the last article shows how very in- 
 significant is lime as a constituent of plant ashes, or as a di- 
 rect source of nutrition in the vegetable kingdom: but as an 
 indirect agent it plays a more considerable part. If it did 
 not the practice of liming with 60, 60 or 70 bushels to the 
 acre to get the six or eight pounds of lime that a hundred 
 bushels of grain require would be folly. The great source 
 of bontfit derived from its use is due : 

1st. To its mechanical effect on the soil, rendering it more 
 light and loamy. 

2d. To its saturating acids formed in the process of vege- 
 table decomposition, and which for a time arrests the activ- 
 ity of this decomposition, and renders the ground cold, wet, 
 heavy and sour. 

3d. It decomposes certain poisonous sulphates, as the sul- 
 phate of iron (green vitriol), or prevents their formation. 
 This is often the case on such black unproductive soils as we 
 find in serpentine localities. The black soil is due to black 
 oxide of iron and its compounds. By the influence of this 
 and that noticed above (3), it often eradicates noxious weeds 
 that flourished on the compounds it destroys. 

4th. It assists in decomposing the insoluble constituents 
 of the soil, and allowing the potash and soda of the decom- 
 posed mass to enter the vegetable. 

5th. It is destructive to certain insects that destroy the 
 vegetables. 

Lime also produces effects the very reverse of the pro- 
 ceeding, and can be used for benefit or injury, according to 
 the time and circumstances of its application. When ap- 
 plied unslacked, particuLarlj' in dry weather, it decomposes 
 the amonical compounds in the soil, and lets the ammonia 
 go free into the air. If mixed with manures it produces the 
 same effect. 

Many people, who are high authority, think that the only 
 advantage gained by burning limestone over that of using 
 the ground unburnt stone is, that in the former case by 
 slacking we get the lime more finely divided than is possible 
 by grinding. When it is burned and finely divided in 
 spreading, it will go back to limestone in a few days only ; 
 the middle of small lumps not entering into combination 
 with carbonic acid. 

To avoid the evils and gain the greatest good from the use 
 of lime, it should be slacked as soon as possible after it is 
 burned (not allowed to fall), and, were it not impracticable, 
 in sufficient water to nearly cover it during the operation, 
 that it may all come in contact with water and slack, and fall 
 into the fine pulverent state before it meets the carbonic acid 
 of the air, and takes on the insoluble form of carbonate. It 
 should be used on the top of plowed ground, where it would 
 not come in contact with the ammonieal compounds of the 
 vegetable decomposition taking place in thesod, or weeds, that 
 were plowed under. If put upon the sod without plowing, 
 as many farmers do who raise more cattle than grain, it 
 should be put on in winter, or while the ground is wet and 
 cold in the spring, as it would not be as destructive to the 
 ammonieal compounds. But using it without plowing does 
 not seem as safe as the mode just described of using it on 
 plowed ground. It should not at any time be mixed with 
 guano or other manures rich in ammonia â€” such an act would 
 be madness. It should not be put on land at the same time, 
 or as a simultaneous coat with any kind of vegetable ma- 
 nure. 

Sulphate of lime (plaster of Paris) should be used in all 
 the combinations containing ammonia, in the barnyard, in 
 guano, &c. Every farmer should have a box full of plaster 
 in the entry, and sow it over the yard and stables almost as 
 often ho litters the latter. 

Some limes have the peculiarity of "deadening the earth" 
 under a large heap which has lain for some months in a 
 place before spreading, and even sometimes when put out in 
 bushel heaps, each heap after laying a short time leaves the 
 marks of vegetable death behind it. This is due to caustic 
 magnesia in the soil, and this goes back to carbonate very 
 slowly, so that an "old lime henp bottom" may be years re- 
 covering its native vigor. A little of the superphosphate of 
 lime, saltpetre, or any acid substance, perhaps a small cart
