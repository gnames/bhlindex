all who have ever tried it must agree that more arduous 
 work can scarcely be found in any department of farming. 
 On Hussey's reaper, where the side delivery is used, two 
 men are required to rake oflf the grain. Where the side de- 
 livery is not used, the gavels must be bound up immediate- 
 ly, as the horses and machine would trample and scatter 
 them in the next round if not removed. Now as I have al- 
 ready mentioned, in all ordinary cases, a boy who can drive 
 a pair of steady horses can operate Atkins' machine. It re- 
 quires no outside help, and once put properly in operation a 
 whole field may be cut and raked with this small force. 
 Here then, in one case, the expense of one hand is saved, 
 and in the other two, and where the binding has to be done 
 immediately after cutting (as in the case of Hussey's and 
 Burral's reaper, when not furnished with side delivery,) the 
 gain is at least equal to four hands. By dispensing with 
 such a number of hands, the difference in the price between 
 it and other reapers is soon made up to the purchaser.

 Plowing Match at the State Fair. 

Messrs. Editors : — In looking over the schedule of pre- 
 miums offered by the State Agricultural Society, my atten- 
 tion was particularly directed to that portion of it which re- 
 lates to plowing. I observed that a premium of ten dollars 
 was offered for the heat plow, eight dollars for the second 
 best, Ac. Will you have the kindness to enlighten your 
 readers a little upon this point by stating what is to be con- 
 sidered the best hind of a plowf Is it a lap furrow or a flat 
 furrow, or a sod plow, or a stubble plow, designed for stiff 
 clay or loose sand? or is it to be a plow which shall combine 
 all the above mentioned qualifications ? It occurs to mo 
 that I have heard very good farmers say that a particular 
 plow was very good for stubble, but would not answer for sod; 
 and others remark that a plow which did good work on stiff 
 soil, was good for nothing on loose sandy or loamy soils, and 
 vice versa. 

It may be contended that there is a plow, which is better 
 than any other in use for general purposes; but this is not 
 the object sought for at plowing matches. The real object 
 is to ascertain the peculiar merits of each plow entered for 
 competition, whether it be a lap or a flat furrow, a stubble or 
 sod, a stiff or loose soil plow. The distinctive characteristic 
 of each plow should be clearly stated at the time it is en- 
 tered, and its qualities in that respect fully tested. 

A few days since, in conversation with one of the most suc- 
 cessful and extensive plow makers in the United States, I 
 endeavored to prevail upon him to send some, or one at 
 least, of his excellent plows to compete at our State plowing 
 match. "What kind of a plow will you have? What is the 
 character of your soil, and how do the committee desire 
 the plowing done ?" was his reply. I, of course, was as ig- 
 norant as himself of the views of the committee. Will not 
 the committee, whoever they may be, see that this error is 
 repaired? If they do not the coming plowing match will 
 be precisely as all others which have proceeded it, both in 
 our own State and elsewhere — a humbug. 

Relying upon the judgment of the excellent men who may 
 be chosen umpires on the occasion, I may feel inclined to 
 purchase the plow which they pronounce the best ; but will 
 it not weaken my confidence in their judgment, as well as in 
 all such trials, if on testing it on iny farm (the soil of which 
 differs materially from that in which the eonitnittee tried it) 
 I find that it will not answer my piirposes at all ? No, let 
 us for this once at least have a thorough plowing match, 
 conducted upon principles that will reflect credit upon all 

concerned in it. Let us have a premium for the best lap fur- 
 row, one for the best flat furrow, one for the best sod and 
 one for the best stubble plow, &c., and then when farmers 
 desire to purchase a plow suited to their particular soils, they 
 will know which kind to select. Yours,

 Bucks County Trial of Reapers and Mowers. 

The trial of Mowers and Reapers, under the direction of a 
 Committee of the Bucks County Agricultural Society, with 
 whom the mat-ter was entrusted, took place according to an- 
 nouncement on the farm of Wm. Stavely, in Solobury, on the 
 4th inst The day was oppressively warm (the thermometer 
 rising to 94° in the shade), but was otherwise propitious, and 
 a very large number of persons assembled, mostly farmers, to 
 witness the experiment. It was estimated that upwards of 
 2000 persons were on the ground — an unmistakeable evidence 
 of the prevailing interest that abounds in regard to labor- 
 saving machinery, that is adapted to the cutting of grass 
 and grain with ease and expedition. 

The mowing was done in the forenoon on a portion of re- 
 claimed meadow and upland — one part being timothy, some 
 of which was fallen down, but not badly, and the other was 
 a mixture of rye and other grasses. The ground selected 
 for the operation was as favorable as could be wished for, 
 generally smooth, but rough enough in places to show tJie 
 capability of the machines in working upon an uneven sur- 
 face. 

The exhibition of machines was "uniform and various;" 
 but, as will be seen, all the different kinds were far from be- 
 ing represented. It would have been gratifying on this oc- 
 casion to have witnessed on trial some that were not present, 
 which have been favorably spoken of, and "got their name 
 up" a little, to see how their working would have compared 
 with those here entered, which were as follows : 

Manny's Mower and Reaper, improved, of 1851, bj' A. 
 Cornell, of Northampton.

Each mowing machine had a section of grass measured off 
 and allotted to it, and between 10 and 11 o'clock they all 
 commenced operations but the latter one, which did not ar- 
 rive until an hour after. 

Wilson & Moore's machine cut but two swaths, one round, 
 when unfortunately a hard piece of wood came in contact 
 with and was drawn into it, which materially affected its 
 operation ; and as it could not be properly repaired at the 
 time, the further trial of it had to be suspended — a matter 
 very much to be regretted, as there was nothing on the 
 ground which performed the work better than this. This is 
 altogether a new machine, and very simple in its arrange-
