There is gi-eat clanger in over-liming where you lime 
 the second time. I have seen and heard many good far- 
 mers say they had ruined parts of their fields by liming 
 too strongly, particularly for oats if the season is dry — it 
 ■will look yellow and good for nothing in spots, as if the 
 gi-ub worms were at it. I could name several fields 
 within a mile of me, that are in with oats now, that have 
 been much injured by over-liming, in some of which the 
 lime heaps have been badly cleaned up, and the oats is 
 spoiled on account of it. The fields most liable to be 
 injured are either of a gravelly or sandy nature. A 
 heavy clay will bear almost any amount of lime, provi- 
 ded you have drained the land. I have limed in many 
 ■ways, and find that without vegetable matter it is not 
 only bad policy but loss of the interest of your money, 
 and perhaps injury to the crop — for instance, liming a 
 corn stubble won't pay. 

Generally speaking, the best place to lime is on a 
 sward two years before plowing it down, or for corn af- 
 ter the sward is plowed, or on new ground. The season 
 I moved on the farm where we now live, I cleared eight 
 acres of land, and limed it with fifty bushels to the acre. 
 My new neighbors thought it strange, but concluded as 
 I was a new-comer in their township, and as to this freak 
 of mine, it was downright nonsense — not one of them 
 approving of it. The crop told for itself, and now hard- 
 ly a man that is able to get the lime on in time where he 
 clears, within five miles of me, but what does the same 
 "foolish thing," as it was then called^ I got one of my 
 clearings limed in part, and 100 bushels of it hauled on, 
 after the wheat was up, in small heaps ; part of which 
 froze and I did not get it spread till the wheat was off ; 
 ■where it was spread, and also around the lime heaps, the 
 wheat was six inches taller and much better. You must 
 be careful, if you haul lime on wheat after it is up, to 
 see that it is thoroughly slacked before spreading, or it 
 may injure the crop. 

The use of lime for twelve years, and in one year of 
 time putting on nearly 7000 bushels on a worn out farm, 
 ■which had been "tenanted" for forty years before I 
 moved here in 1849, I think gives me an opportunity of 
 knowing what has and what can be done with lime. As 
 to the results on the various fields, the amount of lime 
 and manure put on, and grain and grass raised from 
 them, I have it all ■written down in my "lime book." At 
 some future time I may give the experiments on single 
 fields from 1849 to the present time. Yours, with re- 
 spect, B. MORRIS ELLIS.

 Agricultural Gleanings. 
 Lightning. — Its conductors are in the following order 
 of perfection: gold, silver, platina, brass, iron, tin and 
 lead, metallic ores, the fluids of animal bodies, water, 
 ice, snow, green wood, and most earthy substances. 
 Its non-conductors are : glass, sulphur, resin, silk, cot- 
 ton, feathers, wool, hair, pap^r, 'ashes, and most hard 
 stones. Hence in thunder storms, we should avoid 
 standing in the open air, under tall trees, or against 
 high buildings. The safest situation is a house with 

doors and windows open, and a seat on chairs, mattres- 
 es, couches or beds, filled with hair, wool or feathers, in 
 such part of a room as may be out of the influence of 
 conductors, and may not be in the way of any current 
 between windows or doors. 

To tell the distance lightning is from you : The pro- 
 gress of sound is about 381 yards in a second, so that if 
 thei'e are nine beats of a clock, or ten of the pulse of a 
 person in health, between a flash of lightning and the 
 report of thunder, the distance is about two miles, and 
 no danger is to be feared; but if no more than four 
 beats of the clock, or five pulsations, between them, 
 danger may be apprehended, and precaution should be 
 taken. 

Weather. — Signs of wet : Previous to rain cattle and 
 sheep seem more desirous of feeding, and leave their 
 pastures with reluctance ; swine giiint loudly and retire , 
 to their sties; ducks and geese wash repeatedly and fly 
 back and forth ; swallows fly low and twitter louder than 
 usual ; poultry roU. much in the dust ; dogs become 
 drowsy and stupid. A change from cloudy or imsettled 
 to greater wet is announced by flies swarming and sting- 
 ing more than usual. 

Fair weather signs : Bees flying abroad, crows croak- 
 ing in the morning, robins singing early on the elevated 
 branches of trees, and gnats flying in a columnar form 
 within the rays of the setting sun. 

From the appearance of the earth : Moist stones and 
 dry soil prognosticate rain, a continued fall of which 
 may be expected if the ground seems dry ; as the con- 
 trary occurrences announce that the evaporation of hu- 
 midity has ceased, and that fine weather is approach- 
 ing. 

From the atmosphere : If in the evening a white mist 
 spread over a meadow contiguous to a river, it will be 
 evaporated by the siin's rays, and is indicative of fine 
 weather through the day. If a mist over low ground 
 draw ofl" towards the hills it announces a fine day. The 
 gradual diminution of clouds till they can no longer be 
 seen is a sign of fair weather ; so also are abundant dews. 
 The contrary events announce a change of weather, 
 which may more clearly be known by the clouds gather- 
 ing and lowering, and by the sky after serene weather 
 becoming undulated with small clouds. Frequent varia- 
 tions of the wind indicate rains — so do clouds moving in 
 opposite currents, and the lowermost wafted rapid- 

Sheep will fatten well on turnips, but still better if 
 they have some hay or meal with them. It is essential 
 to the evenness of the wool that the sheep are fed uni- 
 formly, for when they are not the growth of the wool is 
 checked, a second growth succeeds, and the point of con- 
 tact becomes so weak as to snap under the operation of 
 the manufacturer. 

Experiment in England : 184 sheep and 30 lambs 
 were kept for six weeks on the product of two acres of 
 turnips. They require to be kept clean, well littered, 
 and regularly salted. 

Animal Food. — Bear meat and opposum the strongest, 
 next pork, this was the food of the Athlatea of old, next 
 beef, and next mutton. Of all the parts of an animal, 
 fat is the most and flesh the least nutritive. Venison 
 and game generally are less nutritive, and more easily
