Work for the Month. 
 Farm : — The operations of the farmer, during this 
 month are of great importance, as upon his labors de- 
 pends, to a considerable degree, the success of his next 
 year's wheat crop. If the ground be not properly pre- 
 pared, or if the seed be not of good quality, and sowed 
 in season, it is futile to expect a remunerating return. 
 First then we should say, let your wheat ground be in 
 good condition ; second, let your seed be good and free 
 from weeds, rye &c. ; and lastly let it be sowed in sea- 
 son. In this section from the 15th to the 20th of Sep- 
 tember, is considered the best time; but we are assured 
 that some of the largest wheat growers in some of the 
 adjoining counties sow as early as the 1st, and it is said 
 never miss a crop. 

Barnyard manure, until recently was almost invari- 
 ably applied to the grounds intended for wheat, but too 
 generally this manure was sadly deteriorated by the es- 
 cape of ammonia, and other fertilizing ingredients. Gu- 
 ano, posessing most of these virtues, that the improvi- 
 dence of the farmer has suffered to escape from hi;? 
 manure heap, acts as a charm upon the wheat crop, and 
 the money invested in it almost invariably returns a 
 good interest. Five or six pecks is ample, if the seed 
 be good and drilled in. If sown broadcast, a larger 
 quantity will be required. Leave no hollows undrained 
 where the water can collect and "drown out" the crop. 

In harvesting the corn, it is scarcely necessary for us 
 to recommend it being cut at the ground, as "topping" 
 is now seldom practiced in this state. Farmers are gen- 
 erally aware that the grain of the topped corn is consid- 
 erably lighter than that which is cut at the roots, to say 
 nothing of leaving stalks standing and straggling about 
 the field. The plan of selecting the seed corn from 
 among the most thrifty growth and earliest ripening, al- 
 though attended with some trouble, is found to be high- 
 ly advantageous. 

xamine and clear out corn cribs, granaries, &c., and 
 make them rat proof before putting in the new corn. 

In gathering potatoes, select for seed the varieties 
 wanted for next year's planting, as they can more 
 readily be distinguished now than at any subsequent 
 time. In storing away potatoes, sec that no wet earth 
 adheres to them. Make arrangements to reconstruct 
 the farmers's laboratory, the barn yard, so as to save li- 
 quid from running away. We can think of no better 
 outlay of money, than a manure shed through the cen- 
 tre of the j'ard, where the manure should occasionally 
 collected through the winter, and composted with soil, 
 weeds, &c. It might be opened on two sides, so that 
 cattle could run over it, and would also answer for shel- 
 ter for them. 

Fruit Orchard. — Budding may still be attended to, 
 at least with apple and peach trees. Examine ties to 
 see that they are not injuring and cutting into stocks or 
 buds. Manure, plotigh and subsoil ground intended for 
 fall planting of orchards. Select your list of varieties, 
 and have them ready for use. Grape vines should have 
 superfluous wood thinned out. Cut out decayed berries 
 from bunches. Pears are best ripened in the house, and 
 should be gathered so soon as they show any signs of 
 turning color. Strawberry beds should be thoroughly 
 weeded out and kept clean during the fall ; for new 

plantations the spring is preferable. Apply wash to 
 bark of trees if not previously done ; and cut out all 
 blighted limbs. 

Vegetable Garden — Within the first ten or twelve 
 days in this month is the proper time to sow cabbage 
 seed for transplanting into frames, to keep through the 
 winter. The season is so uncertain that there is danger 
 of being too early as well as too late. If the fall con- 
 tinues warm, so as to continue their gi'owth, it must be 
 checked by one or two transplantings. Early and large 
 York and Early Sugar-loaf, are the best for this purpose. 
 Prickly-seeded Spinnach should also now be sown for 
 winter and spring use, in ground heavily manured, and 
 at two or three periods in the month. Sow in drills ten 
 inches apart, and cover with the rake. When the plants 
 are up, thin out to three or four inches. The early sow- 
 ings may be used in the forepart of winter. Transplant 
 Endive and sow Radish seed, Corn Salad and Winter 
 Cresses. Lettuce seed should also now be sown, to 
 transplant into beds next month, to remain over winter. 
 Brown, Dutch and H.ai-dy Cabbage are the best varieties 
 for this purpose. Earth up celery as it progresses in 
 growth on dry days only. Gather all seeds as they ri- 
 pen, also medicinal and pot-herbs. New plantations of 
 the latter may now be made by division of the roots. 
 Look over cucumber vines and gather for pickling be- 
 fore they are injured by frost. From the middle to the- 
 last of the month, sow Cauliflower seed, on a rich piece- 
 of ground finely prepared, and rake the seed in careful- 
 ly. If the weather is dry, water before and after they 
 are up, and in the course of a month or six weeks, prick 
 the plants carefully into beds, about three inches apart, 
 and cover with glass as for winter cabbage. Onion seed 
 to stand the winter, may also now be sown. Hoe tur- 
 nips and cabbage and keep the ground clear of weeds, 
 removing all off'al from the ground as each crop is gath- 
 ered, and haul to compost heap. Keep all weeds from 
 going to seed.

Fayette County Stock, &o 
 The editor of the Washington (Pa.) Reporter recently 
 took a stroll through Fayette county, and one morning 
 found himself on the farm of Gen. Goe, (who, by the 
 way, is a good friend of the Farm Journal,) and — but 
 we will let him tell his own story: — "We spent an hour 
 in looking at his stock — the finest, in many respects, we 
 have seen west of the mountains, anywhere. He has 
 Durham cattle that will compare with the best ever ex- 
 hibited at our fairs — sheep not excelled even in our own 
 county, which is saying as much as can be said — hogs, 
 "Suffolks," with all the points of excellence claimed for 
 that peculiar description of animal, and fowls of all kinds, 
 the most celebrated in this country. For his fine French 
 merino buck, "La/ai/ette," he paidjfi'e hundred dollars, 
 and his fleece weighs 24 lbs ! for his ewe he paid three 
 hundred dollars, her fleece weighing 23 lbs. These are 
 remarkably fine sheep, fully equal to any we have ever 
 seen of the kind. The ewe is decidedly the finest im- 
 ported French merino we have yet met with anywhere. 
 Probably "Lafayette" is not a much superior sheep to 
 Mr. Wm. Bukey's "Matchless" — so similar, indeed, are 
 they that we could not draw the distinction nor make a 
 satisfactory comparison in our own mind. I^^ot so with
