regard to the ewe ; she is certainly the best anittial of 
 this species we have met -With in all our walksi Mr. 
 Goe has some six hundred fine sheep — the clip from 
 which will not fall far short of sevehteeii hundred potinds 
 this season. We trust Mr. G. will be rc^imbursed for his 
 large outlay iti imported stock. He has Durham (-alves 
 at five weeks old, which will outweigh some of our na- 
 tive calves a ytar old ! What think you of that, ye ivho 
 are faithless as to the valiie of imported stock? Gen. 
 Goe, we predict, will Irork a thorough revolution in the 
 stock growing character of Fayette county." 

Leaving Mr. G.'s the Writer soon found himself at W. 
 B. Patterson's examining a fine IMorgati horse, the pro- 
 perty of the Fayette County Agricultural Society. He 
 continues ;-="This fine stock horse has many of the 
 points of our own, "Cotterill Morgan"— though not so 
 Hue a horse, in many respects. For ftxrm purposes, we 
 think him superior to the "Cotterill." He is a horse of 
 great bone and muscle-^powerfuUy built, and apparently 
 capable of great endurance. He is very popular with 
 Fayette county fai-mers, and has been very extensively 
 patronised. We found Mr. Patterson — a son of Gen. 
 Patterson, long and favorably known as Representative 
 in the Legislature from this county — an exceedingly 
 . agreeable and pleasant gentleman, engaged in milling, 
 • merchandizing, keeping post office, improving stock and 
 1 farming — occupations enough for any one man this hot 
 ■weather, and a good many more than he can prosecute 
 vwith advantage until the rainy season comes again." 

Spaying Milch. Cows. 
 Spaying of cows, at a certain period of their life, of- 
 fers immense advantages to the agriculturist and consu^ 
 ' mer, in producing much augmentation of milk and meat. 
 In this way the animal escapes a host of ailments, and 
 spares a host of losses, sustained in consequence of her 
 bulling at times when it is inconvenient or impossible to 
 ■ gratify her desires. Spaying of cows, Professor Bouley 
 • says, creates a new race, sterile for breeding, but pro- 
 ductive and valuable for the purpose of yielding milk for 
 the dairy and meat for the butcher. Spayed cows yield 
 : annually, for the first two or three years at least, a third 
 -more milk than they were in the habit of giving before 
 7the performance of the operation. A cow spayed thirty 
 or forty days after calving, or at the time she is giving 
 the most milk, continues to yield, if not for the remain- 
 der of life, at least for many years, the same large quan- 
 tity of milk, and sometimes more than she gave at the 
 itime of performing the operation. 

French veterinarians have, for many years, had their 
 .attention directed to this subject ; and each year their 
 experience, as well as that of agriculturists, leads them 
 to speak more and more favorably of the practice. —

'Washing Trunks of TreeE and the Massachnsetts Hor- 
 ticultural Society. 
 We are pleased to see that the Horticulturist, in the 
 August number, confirms the views we expressed in our 
 leading editorial of July, respecting the very absurd re- 
 port and resolutions of the Massachusetts Horticultural 
 Society, as to the advantages of scraping and washing 
 ithe trunks of trees. From a kind of blind faith in the 

sayings and doings of a society, heretofore so distin- 
 guished as that of Massachusetts, or from some other 
 cause, the said report has been swallowed vhole by all 
 our other agricultural and horticultural exchanges, ac- 
 companied in many of them with highly approbatory 
 comments. If we recollect light the Michigan Farmer was 
 one of them. The Horticulturist speaks of the resolu- 
 tions being credited to the Massachusetts Horticultural 
 Society, but saj-s "we cannot believe that it; or any so- 
 ciety composed of intelligent horticultiu'ists, would send 
 out under its sanction such nonsense." This is a charit- 
 able supposition, and we hope may prove true. It had 
 not occurred to us before. Probably like the celebrated 
 moon story, the report 1vas concocted by some wag in the 
 land of Yankee notions to fill up a vacant space in the 
 paper, ahd stifle the ctill for "more copy." Such jokes 
 are plaj'ed off at the expense of our esteemed friends 
 oftener than they should be. We oUrselves have doubt- 
 ed whether the wooden nutmegs were really made near 
 Boston, as has been positively affirmed.

A Good Opportunity. 

The approaching State and County Fairs present a 
 fine opportunity to young men desirous to earn fifty or a 
 hundred dollars by two or three days active exertion, in 
 canvassing for the Farm Journal. There are many of 
 these fairs at which five hundred subscribers to the 
 Journal might be obtained, were one or two energetic 
 young men to take it in hand, and get their friends to as- 
 sist them. Commissions 33 per cent. 

We have made ample arrangements so that no delay 
 need be anticipated. 

Webb's South Down Sheep. 

By recent arrivals from England, we are advised of a 
 public letting of South Downs at Babraham, the seat of 
 Jonas Webb, the average of which was higher than ever 
 before known. UnusUal interest was excited, and a 
 larger concourse of people were present, from its being 
 understood that Mr. Webb would not this season be an 
 exhibitor at the meeting of the Royal Agricultural So- 
 ciety. Seventy-five sheep were let at the hammer for 
 1,801 guineas, making an average of .£25 4s. 3d. The 
 highest priced, a yearling, one of the six picked of the 
 whole flock, was knocked down to Mr. Lugar, of Hen- 
 grave, Bury St. Edmonds, for 102 guineas. One was let 
 at 80 guineas, one at 71, one at 51, 7 at 50, 6 at 40 and 
 upwards, 6 at 30 and upwards, 21 between 20 and 30, 
 and the balance ranging from 6 to 20. The comparison 
 with former years is as follows : 

Years. Number let. Average price. 

1851 62 £22 2s. 6d. 

1852 69 22 3 1 

1853 71 22 6 3 

1854 75 25 4 3 
 The highest price at which a single sheep was ever 
 known to let was last season, when 130 guineas were 
 paid by Mr. Jonathan Thorne, of New York. 

The times are encouraging to breeders of good stock 
 of all kinds, and the continued high rates of the South 
 Downs for the last four years shows that with them, no
