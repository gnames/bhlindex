farmers in our State, that feel opposed to buying and 
 raising the improved breeds. They tell you it is the feed 
 and not the breed. Well if it would come to taxing them, 
 they would rather pay a tax on one of their own scrubby 
 bulls, than buy a Durham calf, for fifty or a hundred 
 dollars, and the same may be said of improving sheep 
 and swine. 

The fact is, our farmers feel so little interest, and pay 
 so little attention to improving their breeds, that it would 
 be of very little consequence to place good stock in their 
 hands; for we often find men that will introduce good 
 breeds in their neighborhood, and in a few years after- 
 wards, you can find little improvement in the stock, owing 
 to bad management, and so little attention paid to their 
 breeding animals. AVithout care, stock has so m.any more 
 chances to degenerate by crossing and not breeding from 
 pure bred animals, than the chance to improve. How often 
 do we find it the case, that a farmer who keeps no bull, 
 rather than pay a small trifle to a neighbor that keeps 
 up one, would turn his cow out and let her take her 
 chance in the road. We want something that will do 
 away with our old prejudices, habits and customs, that 
 have followed us down from past generations. 

There is too much opposition to what is called book 
 farming. But let a County that takes few or no Agri- 
 cultural papers, has no Agricultural Society, compare 
 with one that has a large circulation of Agricultural pa- 
 pers, a well conducted Agricultural Society, and you will 
 find a considerable difference in favor of the latter. What 
 wc need, brother farmers, is for us to encoiu-age the tak- 
 ing and reading of Agricultural papers, and forming 
 Agi'icultural Societies. These will get up an interest and 
 a competition, it will be the means of getting and improv- 
 ing stock more than all the laws that could be made. It 
 will give us the history of, and information where good 
 stock can be had. These will make us better judges of, 
 and teach us how to take care of good stock if we had 
 them. The farmers have a far greater opportunity of get- 
 ting Agricultural papers "now than formerly, and only 
 look at the Agricultural Societies, forming in most all 
 the Counties, and also improvements of every kind ad- 
 vancing. 

A word on our crops. The wheat is considered rather 
 a small j'ield, owing to severe freezing last winter, and 
 then the nulk wevil or worm coming in the grain while 
 filling. The prospects of spring crops, looked very pro- 
 mising until the drought set in. We have had no rain for 
 several weeks past, but remarkably warm weather, so 
 that our corn crop appears almost a failure. No pot-itoes, 
 oats very light, meadows and pasture completely with- 
 ered up; Apples tolerably fair crop ; Peaches not plentj-.

 Ashes, a remedy to prevent Eavages of the Striped Bug. 
 Mr. Editor: — I notice the recommendations of coal 
 ashes to drive away tlic Striped Bug, from mellon and 
 other vines. I have applied it with success, a handful 
 of unlcachcd wood ashes to each hill of cucumber, mel- 
 lon, and other vines. The bug left immediately and did 
 not return. I think the application should be made be- 
 fore the Bug makes its appearance, asa few hours ore suf- 

ficient for them to destroy or greatly injure all your 
 vines; also should be repeated once or twice as a safe- 
 guard against their re-appearance. It is a simple remedy 
 if always effectual, I have tried other applications with- 
 out success. JOHN HUNTER.

Importation of Eggs. 
 The English Agi-icultural Gazette, speaks of the suc- 
 cess of an exportation of eggs, of some of the choice 
 breeds of fowls, to this country for hatching, which seems 
 to prove tliey will bear extensive carriage pretty well. 
 Unfortunately the mode of packing is not given. If eggs 
 can thus be transported to distantpointsof our own coun- 
 try, it will enable farmers to posses themselves of choice 
 breeds, much cheaper than by buying chickens at the 
 heretofore extravagant prices. The article says that by 
 one of the New York steamers which left Liverpool, at 
 the end of April, a box was sent containing 61 eggs of 
 different selected breeds. They were 12 or 13 days in 
 i-eaching New York, and on being landed were sent on 80 
 miles further by steamboat, and placed under hens on 
 the following day. Of the number sent, four were broken 
 on the joui-ney, and of the remainder one half were 
 hatched and alive on the 27th of June. All but one dozen 
 had been bi'ought to Liverpool by railway. 

Magnolias. 
 J. A. Kenrick in a recent letter to Hovey's Horticultural 
 Magazine, says he has a plant, (under date of May 15, 
 now going out of flower) of Magnolia Sonlangiana, 
 which has produced this season 1500 to 2000 flowers, 
 and a plant of Magnolia Conspicua which has produced 
 at least 3000flowers. 

Warings Elements of Agricxilture. 

This is a small work just from the press of Messrs. 
 Appleton & Co. of New York, intended to familiarize 
 the young American Farmer with the ground work of 
 agricultural science, especially adapted to the use of 
 schools; questions on the subject matter of each page, 
 being placed at the bottom for the conveniences of both 
 teacher and scholar. It is an elementary work, writ- 
 ten by a pupil of Professor Mapes, and dedicated to 
 him. 

The author being a young man, and so recently him- 
 self a student, has been able to appreciate the difficul- 
 ties of beginners, and has relieved his subject of all un- 
 necessary technicalities, by treating it in a simple famil- 
 iar style adapted to even the most ordinary capacity. 

It is just such a work as we should wish to see in ev- 
 ery school house and family in the land. It is divided 
 into convenient sections, commencing 1st. with the plant, 
 2nd. the soil, 3d. manures, 4th. mechanical cultivation, 
 5th. analysis, the true Practical Farmer, and Explana- 
 tion of Terms. 

People's Jourkai,. — Mr. Beach keeps up the beauti- 
 ful appearance of his People's Journal as it advances in 
 age. The fourth number of volume second now before 
 us contains no less than fifty-two engravings on various 
 subjects.
