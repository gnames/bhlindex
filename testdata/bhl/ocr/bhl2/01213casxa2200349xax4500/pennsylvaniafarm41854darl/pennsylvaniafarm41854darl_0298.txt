Good Butter, 
 In what consists the art of making good butter ? More 
 than half the people who go to market have good reason for 
 considering this one of "the great questions of the day." 
 It is a matter in which the health of the communitj- is con- 
 cerned, and as there is great difficulty in procuring a first 
 rate article, and very great variety in the mode of manufac- 
 ture, we have a few hints to throw out, particularly as in 
 some of our exchanges we see practices recommended which, 
 in this celebrated dairy district, have long been discarded. 
 We, believe it is admitted everywhere that Philadelphia but- 
 ter is the best in the United States. As a general thing, it 
 is also a fact that nearly her whole supply of fresh pound 
 butter comes from Chester and adjoining counties, so that the 
 mode of manufacture hero is of some interest. AVhat we have 
 to say about it is entirely practical, the scientijic rationale 
 (there is a scientific reason for every good operation on the 
 farai) wo will leave until another time,or for other pens. 

First. Secure good cows. We do not speak now in refer- 
 ence to quantity of yield, but quality. Wo have owned in 
 our own dairy cows whose cream was oUy, had no hardness 
 or consistency, and if churned alone would never make good 
 hard butter. Such a cow should be separated at once from 
 the dairy and sold. Her cream, if mixed and churned with 
 the rest, will spoil a whole churning, and prevent that most 
 essential point that is called "coming hard." Some cows 
 will also make w/jiVer butter than others on the same pas- 
 tures. Every dairyman should possess a lactometer, and 
 make particular and frequent examination as to the quality 
 and quantity of the cream from each cow, whether it is thick 
 and of a rich yellow color, or thin, ropy and whitish in ap- 
 pearance. Let not the mistake either be made of supposing 
 every cow which gives a large quantity of milk is a good 
 butter cow. We have had cows which gave not much over 
 half the quantity of others to make more butter. Some 
 cows are adapted for a milk and others for a butter dairy. 
 Every cow in the dairy should be named, regularly regis- 
 tered in a book for the purpose, and exact experiments and 
 trial made with her separately, how much butter she will 
 yield per week, its firmness, color, quality, and also the 
 length of timo she will go dry. We are satisfied farmers are 
 often losers by retaining unprofitable cows, which, by com- 
 parison with others in a book of this description, would be 
 shown at once. 

Second. The quality of the pastures. A cow must have 
 abundance of the right kind of pastures, also pure, clear 
 water, not stagnant, accessible at all times, and salt to go to 
 at her own convenience and pleasure. It is extraordinary 
 how quickly and seriously the quality is afi'ected by what 
 the cow eats. There should be no garlic or other noxious 
 weeds, and no range allowed in the woods to cull briars and 
 bushes. The grasses most valued here by dairymen are our 
 green grass (poa pratensis) and white clover. These are 
 natural to this region of country, come up spontaneously in 
 groat abundance, and when mixed, as is the case on nearly 
 all our farms, with timothy and some red clover, form just 
 that variety the cow is most fond of, and which helps to im- 
 part to our btter its peculiar flavor and high reputation. 
 I'ye grass, so far as it has been tried, is much esteemed, but 
 its use is not yet extensive. 

Third. Skimming the cream. The length of timo cream 
 should stand before being skimmed depends of course on the 
 temperature of the spring house, which varies very much on 
 d'fTeront farms. The dairy maid regulates her skimming by 
 her own observation and experience, without having any 
 fixed time. She tries to arrive at the point of time when all 
 the croajn has risen from the pan, and when to let it remain 
 longer it might become mouldy or "fousty." In a cold 

spring house this latter will take place sometimes before all 
 the cream has come to the surface, and in such cases it la 
 not uncommon to put a small quantity of sour milk in each 
 pan, when it is first set away, to induce a more rapid acidity, 
 without which all the cream will not bo obtained. It is a 
 nice point to determine exactly the right time for skimming, 
 no rule can be given for all situations, but without good 
 cream there can be no good butter. It is very common to 
 let a pan of milk stand for three milkings during the sum- 
 mer season before it is disturbed, but this cannot be recom- 
 mended as a general rule, circumstances making it more or 
 less. The cream when skimmed each day is put into deep 
 tin cream pots (about eighteen inches deep), which are 
 placed in water up to the rim in a hole in the spring housd 
 excavated for the purpose. This is to keep down the tem- 
 perature and prevent fermentation. It is also stirred round 
 every morning, or twice a day, thoroughly and carefullj'. 

Fourth. Churning. During the summer season, in all the 
 best dairies, churning is done twice a week. Large revol- 
 ving horse power or water power churns are used. The pe- 
 riod for the churning depends on the temperature of the 
 cream, weather and other causes. More accuracy might be 
 attained by the use of thermometers, which are not so com- 
 mon on dairy farms as they ought to be. It is, however, all 
 important that the butter should "come hard." Without 
 this no manipulation afterwards, however skillful, can make 
 a first rate saleable article. AVhen the indications are that 
 the butter is about coming, or beginning to break as tho 
 phrase is, a lump of ice is thrown in, or some very cold 
 water, and a few additional revolutions of the churn made, 
 which gathers it together into a hard mass, so as to be taken 
 out in lumps, which are placed on the butter table ; tho 
 quantity of fine salt which the experience of the dairyman 
 has proved to be right applied, and the buttermilk worked 
 out with the lever and paddle. It is then set away to cool, 
 generally in a tin vessel, which is plunged in the water. 

Fifth. Working and Printing. Some three to five hours 
 after the first working, it is again placed on the table for the 
 second and final working. The lever and paddle is again 
 used, it is thoroughly turned over, some eight to ten pounds 
 at a time, and, with the aid of a fine sponge, wrapped in a 
 cloth, or fine cloth alone, all the remaining buttermilk and 
 water is dried out. After this it is weighed, printed in pound 
 and half pounds, and placed on the brick floor of the spring 
 house. Washing the butter, so highly recommended in some 
 places, is generally dispensed with here and considered in- 
 jurious not only to tho flavor of the butter, but to its long 
 keeping. The whole process from first to last, except the ta- 
 king out of the churn, is accomplished without using the bare 
 hand, except it may be slightly in weighing. 

White muslin rags are wrapped around the prints, and they 
 are placed on shelves in butter tubs, for carrying to market. 
 In the centre of these shelves is placed a tin tube, for hold- 
 ing ice, to keep the butter hard; others break ice in lumps 
 and distribute it through the tub. A woolen covering is 
 wrapped around tho tub to keep out the heat, and it arrives 
 in market in as good condition as when it left the spring 
 house. Some farmers who have established their reputation 
 for butter, never sell either summer or winter under 3Ti cts. 
 per pound, and often in the winter get 50 cts. 

First Milk of Cows. 

On the question whether the first milk of cows is poison- 
 ous to swine. Dr. Gibbs, of Perry, Ohio, writes to the Coun- 
 try Gentleman, that its injurious effects are owing to it.-J 
 containing, in common with that of many other animals, 
 Colostrum, "the properties of which are not fully known, but 
 it is supposed to be a cathartic provided by nature and â– well
