The State Fair. 

The grounds for the State Fair are being rapidly prepared 
 for the reception of articles intended for exhibition. The 
 enclosure is already completed, and the energetic secretary 
 of the State Society, R. J. Walker, Esq., is pushing forward 
 every department of the arrangements with a success which 
 leaves no room to doubt that every feature necessary for the 
 protection of articles, or the safety and comfort of animals, 
 will be eoinpleted before the arrival of the time appointed 
 for the display. Persons desiring to exhibit choice stock, 
 or articles of any and every description, need be under no 
 apprehensions for a want of every proper and desirable ac- 
 commodation. 

The location of the fair grounds, as we have heretofore 
 remarked, seems in every way adapted to the purpose in- 
 tended. Lying immediately west of the Schuylkill, above 
 Market street bridge, within the incorporated limits of the 
 metropolis of the state, and almost within a stone's throw of 
 the ancient city, from whence radiate the great arteries of 
 trade and travel to all parts of the country, it possesses 
 everj- advantage to be derived from cheap, easy and quick 
 access, while the abundant hotel accommodations of the city 
 will preclude all fear of a dearth of "bed and board." The 
 grounds, too, are eminently adapted for the display, con- 
 taining a noble grove of shade trees, an abundant supply of 
 water, and a surface all that could be desired. 

The only thing wanting to make the approaching fair not 
 only surp:iss all its predecessors, but equal anyone ever held 
 in this country, is a determination on the part of the far- 
 mers of Pennsylvania that it shnll he so. 

There is no portion of the United States, east of the Allo- 
 ghanies, of equal extent, that can be compared in agricultu- 
 ral wealth to the counties of Pennsylvania lying southeast 
 of the Blue mountains. AVithin this district will be found 
 the great Kittatinny vallej', from five to twenty miles in 
 ■width, which, under various local names, extends from the 
 Maryland line to the Delaware river, through Franklin, 
 Cumberland, Dauphin, Lebanon, Berks, Lehigh and North- 
 ampton counties ; here too are the far famed Pequea, Cones- 
 toga and Chester vallies, with their extensions under other 
 names, while a great portion of the remainder is of almost 
 equal productiveuess. Nearly every portion of the district 
 (in itself sufficient to furnish the material of a great State 
 Fair,) is of easy access by canal or railroad to the exhibition 
 grounds, and we shall bo disappointed if its occupants do 
 not show by the excellency, quantity and variety of their 
 display, its title to the reputation it has obtained. Persons 
 will bo in attendance from all parts of the LTnitcd States, 
 and we trust tliat these counties, so rich in all the elements 
 of a great exhibition, will not let the occasion pass without 
 a determined effort to sustain the agricultural reputation of 
 the State. 

While we thus expect much from the southeast, we turn 
 with pride to other portions of the State. Union, Northum- 
 berland, Montour, Columbia, Lycoming and Luzerne coun- 
 ties, lying contiguous to the North and West Branch canals; 
 and Perry, Juniata, Mifflin, Centre, Blair, Cambria, Indiana, 
 Westmoreland, Armstrong, Butler and Allegheny, on or 
 near the Pennsylvania railroad and the main lino ; Fayette 
 and Washington on the Mouongahela, and Beaver on the 
 Ohio, are one and all within easy access by canal or railroad 
 to the Fair. Some of these counties contain largo tracts of 

unsurpassed fertility, while all excel in one or more particu- 
 lars. The high spirited farmers of these counties, we trust, 
 will not lose sight of their advantages, while we know some 
 of them fear no competition from any quarter. From coun- 
 ties more remote from public thoroughfares leading to Phila- 
 delphia we cannot expect so much, but we shall be disap- 
 pointed if Susquehanna, Bradford, Mercer, Erie and others, 
 do not make themselves felt. 

It is a very common thing for farmers, while certain of 
 the superior excellence of their productions, to think that 
 somebody a great way off has better, and when they go to 
 the fair, and see the best there, to think and remark, "I had 
 better than that at home. I wish I had brought it." Avoid 
 this, we pray, by bringing a sample of every thing which is 
 superior. 

The implement department wo are confident will be com' 
 plote. Manufacturers are too wide awake, to fail to show on 
 such occasions whatever will bear the test of examination 
 and comparison. Every agricultural implement of n-erit, 
 manufactured in the United States, will doubtless be at the 
 Fair. This circumstance will be of groat interest to the en- 
 terprising farmer, who wishes to examine new labor saving 
 machinery and improved implements, and will in itself repay 
 a journey from the remotest distance in the state. 

In conclusion we may add that we trust that every farmer 
 in the State who desires the advancement of the farming in- 
 terest, every one who wishes to sustain and enhance the 
 reputation of the State, and having aught that is excellent 
 in stock or produce, will bring it to the exhibition, and there 
 mingle with the hundred thousand other farmers in atten- 
 dance. The fares for travel will in general be but half price, 
 ind he must be a wise man indeed, or a fool, who cannot get 
 the worth of his money by what he will learn by observation 
 of the implements, stock, &c., &c., on exhibition, and by 
 contact with the best farmers in the State. 

Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 

The monthlj' stated meeting of this Society was held last 
 evening in Sansom Street Hall. The President in the chair. 
 The display was far better than usual for the month of Au- 
 gust, especially so in Green-house Plants. A fine specimen 
 of the Buonopnrtca sernitifolia from Mr. Cope's collection, 
 was an object of much attraction ; it is the first time that a 
 plant of this species has bloomed in this country ; it was full 
 ten feet in height, its flowerstem bearing' innumerable green- 
 ish flowers, was more than half that altitude. Among Mr. 
 Buist's handsome plants was a beautiful specimen of the Cler~ 
 odeiidroH Kampherii. for the first time shown; also, the Lo~ 
 hilia St. C/«N-, not before seen on the Society's tables. Mr. 
 Fahnestock's gardener did himself much credit with his pro- 
 fusely flowering plants of the choicest varieties. Mr. Knorr's 
 gardener brought a collection of select kinds, all well grown. 
 From Mr. Dundas's grounds were large and fine specimens 
 of established kinds. A table of richly flowering Balsams, 
 Asters, Coxcombs, and other annuals was shown by John 
 Lambert's gardener. The Baskets of cut flowers and Bou» 
 quets were most tastefully arranged. In the Fruit depart- 
 ment were very fine Grapes, shown by John Riley, gardener 
 at the Insane Asylum ; by Wm. Grassif, gardener to C. P. 
 Fox; by A. J. Smith, gardener at Eden Hail; Alex. Bur- 
 nett, gardener to H. P. McKean and William Johns. Fine 
 Peaches, Plums and Pears came from Isaac B. Baxter's gar- 
 den. The delicious Slnnwiek Nectarine, from Mr. Cope s, 
 was for the first time tested before the Society. Pears were 
 exhibited by Mrs. Markau's gardener and Geo. W. Earl. 

Vegetables — A very OvXtenslve display was made by A. L. 
 Felton.
