tending to the directions given below. Tlie whole secret 
 consists in this: Pl.ace the fruit in bottles or cans, expel 
 the air, hermetically seal, and deposit in a cool cellar, 
 vault, or other cool place, until wanted for use. If, for 
 example, the article to be preserved be peaches, select 
 fair sound ones, pare, cut as for pies, fill the bottles, set 
 these in boiling water when in a few minutes the air will 
 be expelled from them, take them out, cork tightly, and 
 seal thoroughly with sealing wax, or common rosin will 
 answer. Observe as little delay after commencing to 
 pare as possible as the exposure is deleterious. Some 
 pi'efer stewing their peaches slightly, as when a number 
 of bottles are to be put up it expedites the operation. 
 The same may be said as to blackberries, raspberries, 
 &c. If the article to be preserved be tomatoes, stew 
 and season as for the table, using no thickening, cook 
 middling dry, bottle and seal as above. Thus any fruit 
 or vegetable may be preserved, and when the air is pro- 
 perly excluded and the bottles kept in a cool place, their 
 contents will be as good when opened six or nine months 
 hence as to-day. 

Some persons use tin cans, having the lids soldered on 
 and the air expelled through a puncture in the top, 
 which is closed by a single drop of solder. But it should 
 be i-cmerabered that it is best not to put up acid fruit 
 or vegetables in this way, as the corroded metal is some- 
 times injurious to health The glass blowers make 
 quart and half gallon bottles with very wide mouths on 
 purpose for preseiTing. These cost from a six pence to 
 a shilling each. A stock with care will last forever. 

Exhibition Intermitted. 
 The Philadelphia Horticultural Society have resolved 
 to dispense with their usual annual exhibition for this 
 season, and recommend all their contributors to send to 
 the exhibition of the Pennsylvania Agricultural Society 
 at Powelton. If the Franklin Institute adopt the same 
 course, as has been proposed, it will still further increase 
 the interest and attractions of the occasion.

 Seed Corn. 

There are but few farmers who fairly take into consid- 
 eration the extent to which their crops are affected 
 by the quality of the seed. "Like begets like," "as we 
 sow so we reap," are old aphorisms, partaking of both 
 sound and pi-actical philosophy. If we sow imperfect 
 seed we may reasonably expect to reap imperfection, 
 though with a decrease in quality in a just ratio from 
 present organic defects, whilst if we sow good seed we 
 may expect to reap the same with an increase in quality 
 in the same ratio as the deterioration of the former. 

In order to secure good seed corn and improve the 
 quality, quantity and time of ripening, try the following: 
 When your corn is ripening go through the field, and 
 pluck from the stalks such ears as are the earliest, be- 
 ing already ripe, having in view those bearing the largest 
 and most ears to the stalk. Having furnished yourself 
 with a sufl[icient quantity for seed, place it in some dry 
 situation that the cob may become perfectly dry, as tliat 
 will keep it from freezing in the winter, which of a cer- 
 tainty, if allowed to do, will destroy its power of germi- 
 nating. In this situation it may be allowed to remain 

until planting time, when, on removing the husk, it will 
 be found in the most perfect state of preservation, and 
 seldom, if ever, fixil in the germ. 

I have the experience of a practical farmer, who has 
 followed a similar system with regard to the selection of 
 his seed for a number of years. He aflirms that besides 
 a vast improvement in the quality, he finds it as difficult 
 now to select stalks in his field bearing less than two or 
 three ears, as it was at first to find them bearing more 
 than one. JESSE GORSUCH.

Bean's Mowing Machine. 

J. L. Daklington, Esq. — Dear Sir ; — As you request- 
 ed those who used reaping and mowing machines the 
 present season, to forward accounts of how they per- 
 formed, so that the readers of the Journal may draw 
 their own conclusion as to which is the best, and having 
 seen in the August number a report which is not alto- 
 gether correct, and having used one of the machines 
 mentioned, I thought it would not be presuming too 
 much to correct the statement. 

The Bucks county papers containing an account of the 
 trial at Mr. Stavely's, stated that Bean's improved mow- 
 er was on the ground too late to compete for the pre- 
 mium, and, therefore, was excluded from competition on 
 that account ; but I see in the Journal that you have 
 been informed it was entered upon equal terms witli the 
 rest, and, judging from the information in the .Journal, 
 it would seem to be among the machines not noticed 
 particularly by the committee. Having bought one of 
 Bean's mowers and given it a fair trial in light and heavy 
 grass this season, I think it is among the best, if not the 
 very best, in use. 

Mr. Bean got this machine up late this season, and 
 had not time to finish but twenty-three, which were all 
 sold and but one returned, and that was because the 
 parties had not a team sufiiciently strong to draw it. I 
 had been wanting to buy one for the last three years, 
 and have examined many different kinds, and I think 
 Bean's the simplest and less complicated of any, at the 
 same time sufficiently strong and free ft-om side diaft. 
 Having used mine to mow seventy acres, drawn princi- 
 pally by a pair of mules, and hired it to some of my 
 neighbors to mow with, one of whom told me that it was 
 not harder for two horses than a hoe harrow was far one, 
 I therefore feel safe in recommending it to the readers of 
 the Journal as a good mower — one that there is no more 
 risk in buying than a common fanning mill. A num- 
 ber of my neighbors have used other kinds — some say 
 they work well and others say the same kinds will not 
 work at all, but Bean's improved gives universal satis- 
 faction. They are manufactured by Robert Beans, War- 
 minster township, Bucks county, Pa.
