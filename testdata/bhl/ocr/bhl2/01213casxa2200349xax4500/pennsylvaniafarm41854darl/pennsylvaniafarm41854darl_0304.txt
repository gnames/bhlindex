Lubricating Substances. 

Lubricating substances, as oil, lard, and tallow, applied to 
 rubbing surfaces, greatly lesscu the ainount of friction, partly 
 by tilling the minute cavities, and partly by separating the 
 surfaces. In ordinary cases, or where the machinery is 
 siimple, those substances are best for this purposes which keep 
 fjieir places best. Finely powdered black led, mixed with 
 lard, is for this reason better for greasing carrage wheels than 
 some other applications. Drying oils, as linseed, soon he- 
 come stitf by drying and are of little service. Olive oil, on 
 the contrary, and some animal oils, which scarcely dry at all, 
 are generally prefered. To obtain the full benefit of oil, the 
 application must be frequent. 

According to the cxperriments with great care by Morin, 
 at Paris, the friction of wooden surfaces on wooden surfaces 
 is from one-quarter to one-half the force applied : and the 
 friction of metals on motalr^, one fifth to one-seventh — vary- 
 ing in both cases with kinds used. — Wood on wood was dimi- 
 nished by lard to about one-filth to one-seventh of what it was 
 before; and the friction of metal on metal was diminished 
 to about half what it was before. To lessen the friction of 
 wood surfaces, lard is better than tallow by about one-eight 
 or one-seventh ; and tallow is hetter than dry soap aViout as 
 two is to one. — For cast iron on cast iron polished, the fric- 
 tion with the dififerent lubricating sudstances is as follows : 

AVater, i',1 

Soap 20 

Tallow, 10 

Lard, 7 

Olive oil, 6 

Lard and black-lead, 5 

AVhen bronze rubs on rough iron, the friction with lard 
 and black-lead is rather more than with tallow, and about 
 one-fifth more than with olive oil. With steel on bronze, the 
 friction with tallow and with olive oil is about one seventh 
 less than lard and black-lead. As a general rule, there is 
 least friction with lard when hard wood rubs on wood, or 
 metiil ou metal — being about the same in each of all these in- 
 stances. 

In simple cases, as with carts and wagons, where the fric- 
 tion at the axle is but a small portion of the resistance,* a 
 slight variation in the effects in the lubricating substance is 
 of less importance than retaining its place. In more com- 
 plex machinery, as horse power for threshing machines, 
 friction becomes a very large item, unless the parts are well 
 lubricated with the best materials. 

Leather and hemp bands, when used on drums for wheel 
 ■work, or for driving machinery, should possess as much fric- 
 tion as possible to prevent slipping, thus avoiding the necessi- 
 ty of tightening them so much as to increase the friction of the 
 axles. Wood with a rough surface has one-half more fric- 
 tion than when worn smooth ; hence moistenningand rasping 
 small drums may be useful. Facing with buff leather or 
 ■with coarse thick cloth also accomplishes a useful purpose. 
 It often hajipens that wetting or oiling bands will prevent 
 slipping, by keejjing the surfaces soft, and causing them to 
 fit more closely the rough surface of the drum. — Thomas' 
 Farm Implements. 

■*'If the friction at the axle be one-twentieth of the force, 
 and the diameter of the wheels ten times as great as the diam- 
 eter of the axles, at the axles will be reduced to one twelth of 
 a tenth, or one hundred and twentieth part of the force ac- 
 cording to the law of velocities as applied to the wheel and 
 axle. 

New-Rochelle Blackberry. 

Friday of last week, we spent atNorwalk, Ct, in visiting 
 the grounds of two or three gentleman. We first examined 
 more particularly the New-Rochelle Blackberry, (called also 
 the Lawton Blackberry,] of wliich Messrs. Geo. Sej'mour & 
 Co. have a considerable number of plants now loaded with 
 fruit. They have fruited this variety for seven years, and 
 ■we think its value may now be considered so far settled, as 
 to allow an expression of opinion upon its merits. 

It is evidently quite different from the common wild vari- 
 eties, and also different from any that have been cultivated. 
 It is much larger, more uniform in size, and more prolific 
 than other varieties ; it has less seeds, a good flavor, and is a 
 good keeper. It is also thought to be better adapted to poor 
 soils. On this point we cannot speak as positively from our 
 own observation. One thing seems certain that it has not 

I depreciated by cultivation during eight or t«n years. 

As to its sixe, it will surprise most pcr^-oiis who see it for 
 I the first time. At Norwalk we saw sevenil stalks bearing 
 j five to eight quarts each. We tried some that ha«l been 
 gathered over 40 hours, and found the flavor (piite givod. A 
 ([uart of ihem numltered lllbcvries. We pickeda quitrtfrom 
 vines which has received no manure for two years past, and 
 from which the largest had just been selected from the Kew. 
 Haven Horticultural Society, and found that 72 of them til- 
 led a quart measure. 

The vines grow quite large — many of them over an inch 
 in diameter, and the fruit hangs in thick clusters— in si;fu 
 more like very large (}reen Gage plums, than like the ordi- 
 nary black berry. The flavor is not a[>parently diminished 
 by its large size, and the few seeds is not its least recommen- 
 dation. We think this berry a valuable acquisition to our 
 domestic fruits, and worthy of a place iii every garden. 
 Wo have watched this blackberry in several locations for 
 some times past, and are thus pani( ular in describing it, iu 
 order lo answer the numerous inquiries we are continually 
 receiving in regard to it. 

In transplanting it, Messrs. Seymour & Co., recomended 
 selecting plants from two or three feet high, and to set them 
 about the first of November or middle of April, in this latitude 
 They maj' be put out on almost any ordiuarj" soil at a dis- 
 tance of four to six feet. When setting cut it is desirable to 
 cut ott' the vine at four to six inches from the ground. For 
 field culture, they rcconimended preparing the ground by 
 plowing in an ordinary' coating of barn-yard manure. Two 
 or three experiments with guano, di'g in around the hill, 
 have been quite successful. 

To Preserve young Chickens. 
 Keep them in coops, raised some inches from the ground, 
 until they are six or eight weeks old — if they droop after this, 
 the next hour of warm sunshine will bring them up again. 
 A correspondant says the last lime he tried to raise Ihem on 
 the ground, he lost 59 out of 60 ; he has often raised 60 or 70 
 at a time since, without loosing one, simply by cooping them 
 away from the ground until six weeks old. 

Large Yield of Wool. 

Thomas Brown, Esq. — Dear Sir: We bought from J. D. 
 Paterson. of Chataque Co. N. Y. an imported French Ewe in 
 1850 ; her first lamb was a buck. After breeding him, we 
 sold him to Messers. Shcrpneck and Ereekley, of layette Co,, 
 Pa.; they cut from him at 19 months old, 31JUis of fine, clean, 
 unwashed wool; andjust one yearaud two days from the first 
 shearing thej' took from him 25? lbs, which Inst flece they 
 sold for $17, in Philadelphia, making in all 56^^ lbs of wool 
 from one sheep at 2Jyears old; the vreight of the carcos about 
 200 lbs. can any one in the United States beat that ; if thero 
 is any that can doit, we should like to hear of it. 

Our clip of French wool, the present season, brought clear 
 money, 45 cents and a fraction per pound, in Philadelphia. 
 Whole clip averaging over 61bs clean washed wool. P. Brady.

The New Wheat Crop. 

There is much anxiety and speculation as to how the in- 
 coming wheat crop will turn out. Reports are exceedingly 
 various. In some sections of the country the crop is very 
 good, iu others entirely ruined. Throughout the best wheat 
 district of Ohio there will be nearly an entire failure. From 
 Seneca, through Richland, Wayne, Knox and Stark, the 
 great wheat belt of Ohio, the red weevil, or wheat midge, has 
 made pretty thorough work upon all but the Mediterranean 
 and a few very earley fields; indeed the Mediterrane.an wheat 
 has suffered severely in many places. Similar reports reach 
 us from some of the east, and south-west counties, as well as 
 from central Indiana and parts of Illinois. 

On the contrarj' we have favorable reports from almost the 
 entire south-east, extending as far as Georgia, and also from 
 Wisconsin and other western States. 

Fair grouds. 
 The Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanioal Aesociation 
 at Lexington, have contracted with an architect of the city^ 
 for the erection of a stupendous Amphitheatre -And oWier im- 
 provements, on their Fair grounds. The improvements will 
 envolve an outlay of some twelve or fifteen thousand dollars, 
 and are to be completed in time for the annual exhibition iu 
 September.
