cultivated hedge will not occupy over six feet in width, be- 
 ing just half the land occupied by the worm fence. We 
 then gain in fencing 80 acre.« of land, by using the hedge 
 two and three-eights acres, which if judiciously cultivated, 
 will pay for the setting, the triiuiuing and pruning, and all 
 other work that is neccj^sary in raising a hedge. Now we 
 can see that the timber usually worked up for making rails 
 is a total loss to the farmer. 

These, howevor,are not the only advantages that a hedge 
 fence has over the ordinarj' rail fence; but it is also a self- 
 supporting and self-perpetuating fence. With a little atten- 
 tion being paid to it yearly it can be kept up for any length 
 of time. The same principles that caused the young scions 
 to grow will keep it up and repair it yearly, if but the dead 
 ai^d .superabundant sprouts and twigs are removed; and the 
 proceeds of the two and three-eights acres of gained laud 
 will pay for doing this. 

Not so with the rail fence. It will not support itself. In a 
 few years after it is constructed, the bottom or worm rails 
 will rot, the fence become raclced and fallen-down in many 
 pl.aees and must now be rebuilt before it will again secure the 
 crops. Not only this, but new rails are necessary, more val- 
 uable timber must be destroyed, and much hard labor expen- 
 ded to supply the loss of rails, and to repair the breaches 
 and broken down places; and this expeuse and labor will 
 now be required more or less every year. 

Wo think that if every farmer would investigate the sub- 
 ject fairly and candidly, he could come to no otlier conclu- 
 sion than that the old rail fence is yearly detracting from his 
 interests, that it is a sinking structure, while the other is a 
 self-supporting one n. t.

grains of Cayenne pepper, mixed in fresh butter, should be 
 administered Last year we lost several by this disease, and 
 this year the same symptoms manifested themselves among 
 them ; but wo arrested the malady without loosing a single 
 duck, by a dose of the above medicine to such as were ill. '

Striking Cuttings. 
 The following are half a dozen general rules relative to 
 the selection and preparation of slips or cuttings. 1st. Lot 
 all slips be cut off as near a joint as possible without injur- 
 ing it. 2nd. For autumn or winter make choice of well ri- 
 pened firm wood. ;id. In spring or summer half ripened 
 young shoots are best, as they strike quicker than old wood. 
 4th. All succulents, such as Cactuses, Geraniums, Ac, 
 should remain a few days to dry, until their wounds are 
 closed up, before they are potted. 5th. Neverallow cuttings 
 to remain in water; if they cannot be planted immediately 
 lay the ends in moist sand. 6th. In winter or summer al- 
 ways let a few of the leaves remain on evergreens. — Gard's 
 Chronicle. 

Rule for Eaising Poultry. 
 We find the following in the papers without credit, and 
 do not, know its origin. 

1. All young chickens, ducks and turkeys should be kept 
 under cover of the weather during the rainy seasons. 

2. Twice or three times a week, pepper, shallots, shives, or 
 garlic, should bo mixed up with their food. 

3. A small lump of assafcetida should be placed in the pan 
 in which their water is given them to drink. 

4. Whenever they manifest disease, liy the dropping of 
 their wings or any other outward signs of ill-health, a little 
 assafcetida broken into lumps, should bo mixed with their 
 food. 

5. Chickens which are keptfmm the dunghill while young 
 seldom have the gaps ; therefore it should bo the object of 
 those who have the charge of them, so to confine the hens as 
 to preclude their young from the range of barn or stable 
 yards. 

6. Should any chickens have the gapes, mix up small por- 
 tions of assafoetdia, rhubarb and pepper into fresh butter, .ind 
 give each chicken as much of the mixture as will lie on half 
 the bowl of a small tea-spoon. 

7. For the pi^i, the following treatment is judicious : T.ake 
 ofi"the indurated covering on the point of "the tongue, and 
 give twice a day, for two or three days a piece of garlic the 
 size of a pea; if garlic cannot be obtained, onion, shallot or 
 shives will answer ; and if neither of these be conven- 
 ient, two grains of black poper, given in fresh butter will 
 answer. 

8. For the snuffels, the same remedy as for the gapes will 
 be highly curative ; but, in addition to them, it will be ne- 
 cessay to melt a little asafetida in fresh butter, and rub the 
 chickens about the nostrils take care to clean them out.

 vultions. In such cases, four drahms of rhubarb, and four 

Spiraea Gandifiora. 

We are happy to say that this Spirreais perfectly hardy. 
 The plants originally introduced are now growing in our 
 nursery here, wiiere they have been ever since their intro- 
 duction iu 1849. They have never h acKany protection what- 
 ever. The plants are 6 or 7 feet high, and as much through. 
 Tlieir general appearance is decidedly that ofanAmelan- 
 chier ; and it is only when examining the suckers that any 
 resemblance to a Spirasa is perceived. 

Madura Hedges • 

My object in this article is to meet some objections to the 
 Osage Orange Plant itself, inasmuch as my experiance tells 
 mo that there is known no plants so peculiarlj' adapted to the 
 purpose, and so valuable to our Agricultural interest. Its 
 surprising properties are nolonger apioblem. Some writers 
 are yet disposed to class it among the 'humbugs,' and may 
 doubt its utility, but amongst them all you will not probably 
 find much, if any experience. If rightly managed it makes 
 the best and cheapest fence in the v.'orld without any excep- 
 tion whatever. 

Beleiveing then as I do in the extraordinay properties of 
 the Osage Orange (Madura) for making Live fences, I will 
 state what I believe the best mode of cultivation and manage- 
 ment, in as few and plain words as practicable, so as to be 
 understood by the inexperienced— with the hope that all in- 
 terrested persons may practice, and enjoy its benefits. 

In order then to make the seed vegetate surely and quickly 
 they require to be soaked a long time in worm warter — usu- 
 ally three, four or five days, but always until they are very 
 much swolen and sprouted. The water should be kept warm 
 all the time. 

The nursery shoud be located with care. It should be a 
 rich sand}' loam. If you have none sueh — prepare the 
 best spot you have, by deep and thorough cultivation, mixed 
 with wellrootted manure, if nototherwise rich enough — -mak- 
 ing the drills about one foot apart, and before dropping the seed 
 send to the woods and get some of the richest and sandiest 
 mould you can produce, — drop the seed, and cover with tlie 
 woods mould an inch or an inch and a half deep. If the 
 seed are well soaked — the ground clear and strong, they will 
 make their appearance before the weeds and grass will inter- 
 fere with them. So soon as they are well up, (he greatest 
 care will be necessary to avoid thelaborof hoeing and weed- 
 ing, which can only be done by mulching well with leaves, 
 cut straw, saw dust, or fan bark. I name the mulching ma- 
 teaials in the rotation 1 think they answer the best. The 
 whole nursery should bo covered, except only the plants ; 
 and put on thick enough to )ire\~ont the grass and weeds 
 from appearing ; bv doing so all further labor will bo avoid- 
 ed.
