-^the middle of May is soon enough, 

The next spring they are ready for setting in the Hedge 
 ■ — the ground for which should have been well prepared the 
 previous fall, by subsoiling, and manured if necessary, and 
 and again in the very early Spring ploughed harrowed and 
 rolled repeatedly till completely pulverised — then drive the 
 stakes , — lay the line and spado the trenches. More care is 
 necessary in hmtkhi'j up plant.'' to insure their growth, than is 
 usually observed ; and more with this, as it is desirable that 
 everyone should grow. The top may bo cut off to si.\ inches 
 and the roots pruned proportionally. Set the plants in a 
 'double row six inches apart, diagonallj' — thus**.®.:?.*.^;*^;* — 
 a foot apart in each row, making them equal to six inches in 
 a row. As soon as planted mulch dccpli/ with leaves, straw, 
 saw dus^or tan bark, and they will want no further attten- 
 tlon until the ne.xt spring, at which time, the pruning com- 
 mences, and you begin by cutting all otf within an inch of 
 the ground — in the middle of June cut all the tops agaiu to 
 within four inches of the former cutting — the next Spring cut 
 to with five inches of the preceding, and again the middle of 
 June to within six inches, and so continue cuttingeach siiring 
 and .Tune, increase the distance an inch each time, till the 
 Hedge is high enough. Bj' this means you thicken the hedge 
 perfectly all the way up, and when grown it will require the 
 the less pruning from there being large stalks. ]3y prun- 
 ing the tops only while growing, the side branches become 
 the stronger ; they can afterwards be pruned and thickened, 
 till it may be made impenetrable to a bird. The mulching 
 may require some renewing the second year, but afterwards 
 the shade of the Hodge will prevent the interference of the 
 grass and weeds. 

The plants should never be set further apart than I have re- 
 commended above — particularly in strong soil, as the further 
 apart they are sot the stronger they will grow, and create so 
 much more pruning after the Hedge is grown, or otherwise 
 be objectionably high. Neither will the roots extend so far 
 when closelj' set. 

The Hedges should be fully protected from stock for the 
 first two years. Moles often burrow under the Hedge, des- 
 troying the roots — to remedy this, make the ground 'dish- 
 ing' where the plants are set two or three inches lower than 
 the sides, which is found effectual, and the plants flourish 
 better. 

The prunening may be made a comparatively small job, 
 hy using a strong knife for the purpose about two feet long. 
 A common grass hook answers pretty well, and some la- 
 bor may be avoided by pruning in the fall, before the wood 
 becomes hard, in place of the spring. The plant bears it so 
 well, that there is no danger. 

The 'plashing', 'plaiting,' or 'interclashing,' when rightly 
 done, may make a perfect fence, and quite ornamental — p.ar- 
 ticularly while young — but is expensive : and for common 
 purposes, I would not rocommeud it further than to stop a 
 gap. 

I am persuaded that the plant may be used much farther 
 north than has been admitted. For the first two or three 
 years the limbs will bo severely nipped by the frosts, but not 
 to the injury of the fence. Respectfully, Wn-HAM Neff.

Profitable Crop of Ruta Bagas. 

It is not often that we can record instances of more profita- 
 ble culture, than the following, as stated by our friend, Chee- 
 ver Newhall, of Dorchester ; 

The land on which the crops mentioned below grew, was 
 poor pasture land, and had not been cultivated for more than 
 thirtj' ye.ars. It was ploughed in the fall, and again in the 
 spring ; was well manured, partly with night soil and p.artly 
 ■with piggery manure, to which was ailded a quantity of guano 
 and ground bones, — the cost of the latter being $5 (iO per acre. 
 The first crop of potatoes grow well and yielded fairly : were 
 dug early and sent to market. In digging the potatoes, the 
 tops were laid regularly between the rows ; at the same time 
 caro was taken to haul the earth over them, which made 
 somewhat of a ridge. The ridges were three feet apart. 
 The rnt,a baga seed were dropped ujjon them, nine inches 
 apart, at several times, betAveen July 27th and August 10th. 
 No plough was used after taking otf tho crop of potatoes. 
 At least one-tenth of tho spaces intended for tho ruta baga 
 ■were vacant, as the seed did not vogitate. About ten days 
 after the plants were up, the cultivator was passed between 
 the raws ; the plants were thinned out, leaving but one in a 
 space, and thoroughly weeded. This is all the cultivation 
 they received. 

About the 20th of October, the entire crop on tho five acres 
 was sold for one hundred and fifty dollars — the purchaser to 
 take them from the ground, were they then were. 

The person who bought them says that the product was 
 more than twelve hundred bushels, and that they were all well 
 worth the sum he paid for them. When itis considered that 
 this crop was raised upon land that had produced a fair yield 
 of pot^atoes, and that thirty dollars per acre was realised for 
 a second crop, while the exponco did not exceed five dollars 
 per acre. I am led to believe that land will sometimes, at 
 least, pay the cultivator a fair compensation lor tho labor 
 bestowed. — Fractlcnl Fnrmer.

How to Know the Age of A Horse, 

The colt is born with twelve grinders. When four/ront- 
 teeth have made their appearance, the colt is twelve dnys old; 
 and when tho next four comes forth, it is four weeks old. 
 When the co/-)/</--teeth a))pcar, the colt is eight months, and, 
 when the latter have attained to the higth of they')-ci«<-teeth, 
 it is one year old. The two year old colt has the kernel (tho 
 dark substance in tho middle of the tooth's crown) ground 
 out of all the/roH^tteth. In the third year the middlrfront 
 teeth arc l)eing shifted ; an<l when three years old those are 
 substituted by tho /lorse-tecth. Tho next four teeth are shift- 
 ed in fourth year, and thec«r)i<"r-teeth in the fifth, At six 
 years the kernal is worn out of the lower middle front-tKioth, 
 and the /j)-i"rf(//p-tccth have now attained to their full grov/tn. 
 At seven years a hooh has been formed on the co;-jier-tceth 
 of the upper jaw the kernal of the teeth next at the middle 
 fronts is worn out, the bridle-teeth begin to wear off. At 
 eight years of age, the k-ernal is worn out, of all the lower 
 front-teeth and begins to decrease in the middle upper 
 fronts. In the ninth year, the kernal has wholly disappea- 
 red from the npper middle front-teeth, tho hook on the 
 corjier-teeth has increase in size, and the bridle-teeth 
 lose their points. In the tenth year the kernal is worn out 
 of the teeth next to the middle fronts of the upper jaw ; and 
 in the eleventh year the kernal has entirely vanished from 
 the corner teeth of the same jaw. At twelve years old, tho 
 crown of all the front teeth in the lower jaw, has become 
 triangular, and the bridle teeth are much worn down. As 
 the horse advances in ago the gums shrink away from the 
 teeth, which, consequently, receive a long narrow appear- 
 ance, and their kemals have become metamorphosed into a 
 'darkish point, gra}' hairs increase in the forehead, over tho 
 eyes, and tho chin assumes the form of an angle. — Practiaal

Green Crops for Barn use In Summer. 

It is the great number of cattle that a British fanner keeps 
 on his farm, which by furnishing so much good manure, en- 
 ables him to raise such good crops. The turnip crop, occupy- 
 ing ono-forth his farm, furnishes him the grand moans »'■ 
 keeping so large .a stock during the winter mouths ; an? 
 the practice of soiling his horses and cattle, enaliles him to 
 keep more animals than he otherwise could during sum- 
 mer. 

By soiling, is meant the S3'stem of feeding cattle in sheds 
 and stalls on green food grown for that purpose, instead of al- 
 lowing them to graze the fields at pleasure. That more food 
 can in this way be obtained per acre, few will question. 
 That wo can adopt soiling, except in some few cases near 
 large cities admits of some doubt. One of the great ob- 
 jections to the practice is tho greater amount of labor re- 
 quired in mowing and carrying to the barn the green food, 
 than in letting the cattle cut it themselves. Another objec- 
 tion is that our climate is not so well adapted for the produc- 
 tion of succulent summer food as the cool moist climate of the 
 British isles. Yet, as we have often said, we obtain heavier 
 crops of rod clover than do British farmers, and red clover 
 is there considered one of the best ercps for soiling purposes ; 
 and could it be grown with as much certainty and in such 
 quantity as in AVestern New York, it would be much moro 
 extensively used. 

Wo believe it would pay every faimer to take an acre or 
 two of clover, as contiguous to the barn as possible, and m.i- 
 nuro it highly in the fall or spring. It would be found of 
 great advantage to cut and feed to the horses in the stable at 
 noon, and for an our or so before turning them into the field 
 in the evening. A few acres so manured and cut early, 
 would afterwards yield a splendid crop of chiver seed : or it 
 might be mown twice, as green food for the horses and 
 cattle. 

Indian corn is perhaps (he best food that we can grow for
