Breeding and Management of Stallions. 

We commend the following standard article from the 
 United States Journal of Agriculture to the attention of our 
 readers : — 

It is difficult to decide at what period of its history to 
 commence our account of the Stallion-colt. If we begin at 
 his birth, we are reminded of various matters antecedent to 
 that — to him important — epoch, that have a material influ- 
 ence upon his aft«r life. To be safe, let us go back to his 
 progenitors. 

As males communicate their organization with the most 
 obvious effect, it is by no means singular that great stress is 
 laid, by breeders of horses and other animals, upon the ap- 
 pearance, physical conformation and constitution of the sire. 
 This is commendable. But farmers and breeders generally 
 are not as fully aware as they should be, that various items, 
 other than color, style and figure, are transmissible from sire 
 to son. These are contracted feet, founder, spavin, ring- 
 bone, curb, sandcrack, diseases of the eye, and of the respi- 
 ratory organs, as broken-wind, roaring, wind-sucking, Ac, 
 Ac. We are as fully persuaded, that these affections and 
 diseases are hereditarily transmissible, as that color, action 
 or temper may be so transmitted. 

At the late National Exhibition of Horses, held at Spring- 
 field, Mass., the writer was Chairman of the Committee on 
 Geldings, in which class were 109 entries. Many of the fi- 
 nest horses subjected to their e.xamination were found to be 
 affected with ring-bone and other diseases of the leg and 
 foot; and the reply to the question of the Committee on this 
 point invariably was — "Ae wag foaled so." 

In this view of the case, it becomes breeders to look well 
 to it, that the selected Stallion have no hereditary tendency 
 to disease, or defect capable of being transmitted to the off- 
 spring ; for "like begets like," and as surely as a noble steed 
 can mark his offspring with his good qualities, so certainlj- 
 can he hand down also his imperfections of temper and for- 
 mation. 

If men are too often careless in the selection of a Stallion 
 for purposes of breeding, what shall we say of their choice 
 of a mare? Any old, decrepid, diseased, purblind she-horse 
 that can bo procured, or that is found fit for no other pur- 
 pose, is considered good enough to breed from ! And many 
 such an old, good-for-nothing-but-the-compost-heap creature 
 is kept by farmers and others for this especial and only pur- 
 pose. Knowing this, one ceases to wonder that the country 
 is stocked with such a supcrbundant supply of miserable, 
 early broken down and diseased horses, — insomuch, that ho 
 who now-a-days undertakes to buy a horse on his own judg- 
 ment, unless he goes with his eyes peeled, and "had his eye 
 teeth cut" at an early period of his existence, will, ordinari- 
 ly, find himself sold remarkably cheap. 

"Any one," says Mr. Castley, an eminent English Veteri- 

nary Surgeon, "who, during the last twenty or twenty-five 
 years, has had frequent opportunities of visiting some of our 
 great horse-fairs in the North of England, must be struck 
 with the sad falling-off there is everywhere to be remarked, 
 in the quality of the one-half, and three-part bred horses, 
 exhibited for sale. The farmers when taxed with this com- 
 plain that breeding horses do not sufficiently repay them; 
 and yet we find large sums of money alwaj's given at fairs 
 for horses that are really good. The truth is, that farmers 
 do not, now-a-days, breed horses so generally good as they 
 used to do; and this is owing to the inferior quality of the 
 mares, which they now commonly employ in breeding. 

Some of the best mares, it would appear, are now pur- 
 chased by gentlemen for saddle horses, — it being now, as it 
 was not formerly, as fashionable to use mares as geldings 
 for riding' purposes. A great number of the finest three- 
 part bred mares, also, are imported to the Continent. 

These facts account for the deterioration of the horses in 
 ordinary use in England, .and most of them are in force here. 
 Many an old broken-down creature is purchased, or kept for 
 a breeder, because she is Jit for nothimj else ! Fit for nothing 
 else ? If fit for a breeder, (unless injured by some accident,) 
 she is fit for any thing else. 

Sire and dam being judiciously selected, our next care is 
 with the unboru colt — the ftetus. "Our next care," we say, for 
 the young courser may be starved, or otherwise maltreated, 
 as effectually before, as after birth. The mare, when with 
 foal, should be well, but not too plentifully fed, should not 
 be overworked nor yet allowed to lack exercise, and should 
 never be subjected to such rough usage as is but too common 
 among farm hands and stable-boys, who are ever over-free 
 with the toes of their cow-hide boots. Discharge such at 
 once, after having treated them to "a little of the same," to 
 see how they like it, for no one taken down with the ac- 
 cursed disease of "Cruelty to Animals," was ever radically 
 cured of it. 

It is well to offer the mare, immediately, and, for a few 
 days after parturition, a drink of lukewarm water with corn 
 or oat meal, or shorts, mixed therein. She should then be 
 permitted to run out to grass for a month, at least, to recov- 
 er strength, though the common custom, we know, is to put 
 them in harness within a fortnight from foaling. 

Our young Stallion being now fairly in the world, and 
 moving upon it on his own legs, his first experience of life 
 is stirring. The old farmer has an errand at a neighboring 
 village, distant some six or seven miles. "Put Bessy to the 
 old chaise," says he, and off he drives with commendable 
 moderation — little Morgan trotting in (^mpany ; but busi- 
 ness being concluded at the store rain threatens, or other 
 cause induces a hasty return : and we see Bessy doing all 
 she knows how to get home in season, and little Morgan do- 
 ing a little more, to keep up. His long, lank legs soon get 
 tired; his footing is un.sure : his bellows get out of order;
