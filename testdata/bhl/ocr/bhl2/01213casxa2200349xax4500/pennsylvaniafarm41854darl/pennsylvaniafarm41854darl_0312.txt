There is a clasa of mares much higher than that which I 
 have described above ; I mean those which combine great 
 power with a pedigree little short of thorough bred — mares 
 which have in their youthful days been foremost in the 
 hunting field, and contended, perhaps not unsuccessfully, in 
 the steeple chase. Such are the dams of the cracks of the 
 Melton field, and of the victors at Liverpool and Leaming- 
 ton. But they are so difficult to buy, and go rarely in the 
 market, that the majority of breeders have little chance of 
 trying their luck with them. Their owners naturally de- 
 sire to secure a foal, when it may be a great prize, won at a 
 small cost, and will therefore seldom be disposed to part with 
 them. It requires, moreover, a more ripened judgment, and 
 more mature experience, to select mares fit for the produc- 
 tion of first class hunters and steeple chasers, than for the 
 rearing of a less ambitious character of stock. The stallion 
 to which they are put ought to be one of a superior class to 
 the majority of the itinerant animals which secure the cus- 
 tom of so many farmers, simply because they save them the 
 trouble of further inquiry. It may be laid down as a gen- 
 eral rule that the horse ought, if possible, to be a better an- 
 imal than the mare. Then there is the difficulty, even when 
 a horse of tried excellence is found, of discovering whether 
 his points and his blood suit the mare. The art and the 
 science of breeding first rate horses are not to be mastered 
 without much thought, trouble and research. There is no 
 royal road to it. He who wishes, in spite of every obstacle, 
 to attain golden results, must adopt a course the very antip- 
 odes of the too common one, of putting some mare, because 
 he happens to have her, to some horse, because it happens 
 to come into his yard. He must never breed from a bad 
 mare or a bad horse ; nor must he grudge a few pounds 
 spent in securing the best of either sex within his reach. 
 A judicious outlay of capital will here assuredly not fail to 
 reap the reward which has attended the improvement of 
 every other description of stock. — 3Iark-Lane Exyress.
