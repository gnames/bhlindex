Remedy for Wheat- Weevil. 

In answer to a roi-ent inquirj', we gave it as our opinion 
 that one of the most promisin;; means of avoiding the wee- 
 vil, was to tiow early on good soil, that it might advance 
 towards maturity soon enough to escape the depradation of 
 this insect. Since making this suggestion, we have con- 
 versed with a skilful farmer of Western New-York, who 
 lives in the midst of a fine wheat region, (where the soil is 
 rather light and gravelly, but usu.ally produces excellent 
 whept,) and who has given as his opinion that the severe 
 weather of spring added to the attacks of the insect, has re- 
 duced the crop in this region to an average often bimlielg per 
 acre, or one half the usual average, which is estimated at 
 twenty bushels. He has just cut a field of the finest wheat 
 that lias yielded over thiriij huxhel per acre, and and a sin- 
 gle weevil wns scarcely to bo found in any part. This crop 
 was put in just at the close of summer — very early — on 
 ground prepared as follows: A pasture posessing a fair 
 amount of fertility, was well plowed with a double team, 
 and a good dressing of well rotted or compost manure 
 spread over the inverted sod. It was then thoroughly har- 
 rowed, to break it fine, and to mix it with the soil — an 
 operation o.*" great importance. The whole wa,.^ turned un- 
 der with a gang-plow, without disturbing the inverted sod. 
 The wheat was then sown with a drilling machine. Tlie 
 soil was rather gravcllj', not lialde to bocorao water-soaked, 
 and none of the crop was winter-killed. This gentleman 
 gives it as his opinion that wheat put into the very best 
 soil prepared in the best manner, and sown as early as the 
 last of summer need excite no apprehension of weevil — he 
 thinks it will be safe. Other wheat, which ho harvested 
 this year from ground last year in corn, was half destroyed 
 and ho intends to raise none but in the thorough manner 
 at>ove described. Country Gent. 

The Grape Crop. 

The season has not been the most favourable for our vino- 
 yards. During the last week we have visited some vine- 
 yards and made diligent inquiry concerning all, with a view 
 to .ascertain the prospets of the coming crop. 

Among the vineyards on the hills and slopes in Storrs 
 township, the grapes are fine, and promises rather more 
 than an average crop. 

In the neighborhood of Carthage, the Catawlias are badly 
 mildewed. The Isabellas are not seriously injured, though 
 there is still time for them to be spoiled. 

There are not raa.ny vines in the northern part of Colum- 
 bia township, but the grapes there are looking well. Mr. 
 Ben. Kettredge, who has a farm near Plainville, has the best 
 vineyard in that neighborhood. Ho will getnearly anaverage 
 crop. At Plainville, .ludge Cross has nearly two acres of 
 thrifty vines, from which he will get an average crop. The 
 vineyards of Messers. Collins and Bramble also look well. 
 Mr. Rintz, whose vineyard is near the river road, will have 
 bat a light corp this season. Last year Mr. Rintz, made five 
 thousand gallons of wino from five acres of ground, an un- 
 precedented crop. 

One of the largest and best worked vineyards near this 
 city is that of Messrs. Corueau, the celebrated manufacturers 
 of Still and Sparkling CaUvwba wines. Messrs. Corneau 
 ■will gather an average crop this seas(m. They mal;e a 
 large quantity of wine, annually, of their own vintage. 

On the wliole, we believe that the grape crop of 1854 will 
 be something less than an average crop. 

Spanish Fowls. 

A writer in an English paper recommended the Spanish fowl 
 as preferable to any other breed, for the following rea- 
 sons : 

It is decidedly a handsome bird. It is sufficiently numerous 
 to be ea.'-ily obtainable. 

A cross in the breed is easily iletected. It is as e.asily kept 
 as any kin<l of fowl, and lays a largo well shaped egg, 
 and wlien put on the table is not to be surpassed by any for 
 the quality and delicacy of the flesh. — Boston Cultiia'.or. 

Black Spanish Fowls. 
 A writer in the Cultivator commends this breed of fowls 
 for the following ronsous ; their beauty ; case of obtaining 
 them ; case of keeping them ; large eggs; and the quantity 
 and delicacy of their flesh. — Wo once had a pair of them, 
 and were so well pleased with thorn that were we to excliange 
 the White Shanghais for any other variety, it would be this 

Covered and 'Uncovered Manure. 

Having lately perused some account of the experiments 
 made by Lord Kinniard, reported in the Jaurnal of the Ag- 
 ricultural Society of England, on the comparative value of 
 covered and uncovered manures, it occurred to me that a brief 
 sketch of these experiments and their results might contrib- 
 iute towards fixing in the public mind an impression of the 
 mportanco of more care, than now generally prevails, in re- 
 gard to the protecting yard manures and saving them from 
 waste. 

In 1851, a field of 20 acres, of very equal quantity, being 
 a rich loam naturally dry and in good hearth, with an expo- 
 sure to the south, was selected for the experiment, and di- 
 vided into two equal portions. The manure was applied at 
 the the rate of 20 cart loads per acre. 

The whole field was planted with potatoes; the seed all of 
 one kind, and planted first and second week in April. All 
 braided well, and showed nodifferance ingrowth till the first 
 week in Julj', when a decided supeirority began no manifest 
 itself in the half of the covered yards. The vines on the por- 
 tion of the field manured from the exposed yards began to 
 decay by the hitter end of July, while the other porition of 
 the field still retained its dark green. The crops were taken 
 up on the 1st to the 4th of October, and after careful measur- 
 ment and weighing of two sejierato portious in each division, 
 the result was as follows :

As soon as possible after the potatoes were harvested, the 
 field was ploughed and wheat drilled in, at the rate of three 
 bushels per acre. As soon as the weather was suitable in the 
 spring, the whole field got a dressing of 3ewt. of Peruvian 
 guano per acre. During the winter very little difference was 
 appareut:but shortly after the application of the guano, the 
 wheat on that portion manured by the covered dung took ade- 
 cided lead, which it ret^iined all summer. The whole field 
 was cut on the 2fit,h of August, 1851 ; the portion manured 
 by the uncovered dung being at least four days earlier than 
 the other. As before, the two seperate portions iu each half of 
 the field were measured, cut and stacked seperately. On the 
 4th of September eachportion was thrashed, the grain care- 
 fully measured, and the straw. On account of a wet season 
 the grain was lighterwcigiit than usual, in Great RritJiin, per 
 bushel. The result of the experiment was as follows :

These and similar experiments have satisfied Lord Kin- 
 n:.ird of the advantages to be derived from having farm yard 
 manures put under cover. They siein so conclusive and in- 
 structive on this point, as to deserve to be brought before 
 the farming classes of this country. Not a few of our readers 
 we doubt not. will take measures of some kind to profit by 
 them. It will require but a few minutes to determine the 
 probable profits of protecting anj' certain amount of yard ma- 
 nure. It appears from the above results that Lord Kinnaird 
 got about 125 bushels of wheat more from ten acres manured 
 with covered dung, than from the ten acres which had been 
 manured with the uncovered. In wheat alone, then, without 
 taking potatoes or wheat straw into account, the difl'erence 
 in favor of covered manure was quite considerable. — Country
