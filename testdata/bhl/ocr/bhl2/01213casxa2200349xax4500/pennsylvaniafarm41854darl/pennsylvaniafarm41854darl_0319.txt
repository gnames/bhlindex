I winter, for which purpose procure boards about one foot 
 wide, of the requisite length to hold the desired number 
 of plants and to suit the sash, and arrange them in any 
 sheltered situation. They should be nailed to short 
 posts at the four corners, and be one foot high at the 
 back and about six inches in front. Shutters or straw 
 mats should be provided to guard against extreme cold. 
 Bank up the earth on the outside of the frame. Plants 
 kept in this way should have air through the winter on 
 all fine days, so as to harden them by exposure. If kept 
 too warm they will continue growing and become tender. 
 Continue earthing up celery ou fine and dry days. Trim 
 out growing crops of spinach and kale. Clean and dress 

J beds of aromatic herbs by cutting out decayed stems, 
 and digging between such as will admit of it. If the 
 ground is poor, top dress with rotten manure. Onions, 
 if not already planted, should be set out to make offsets 
 for early sjjring use. Seed of rhubarb may now be sown. 
 Dig up horse-radish for use as wanted. Collect pump- 
 kins and winter squashes ; also all cabbage stumps and 
 oiher refuse stuff from ground now vacant, and haul to 
 pig pens or compost heap. If the soil is at all stiff, it 
 should be dag or plowed up deeply before the apj^roach 
 of winter. 

Flower Gaeden. — All plants that are tenacious of 
 frost should be attended to the early part of this month, 
 and got ready for winter quarters ; all plants intended to 
 flower in the window should be potted immediately, and 
 placed in a cold fi-ame and shaded from the sun for a 
 short time to take fresh root. When they have become 
 established give air freely. Sow flower seeds on a south 
 )^order the early part of this month, to remain out over 
 winter. The following are suitable for that purpose : — 
 Candytuft in variety, Clarkias do., Gillies do., dwarf 
 German Larkspur, Erysimum Perofskianum, Escholzia 
 Californica, Coreopsis Bicolor. When hard weather sets 
 in, these should be covered with dry leaves or long lit- 
 ter. Tulips, hyacinths, &c., should be planted now to 
 ensure success in blooming. The soil must be rich. If 
 the soil in the bed is naturally poor, it will be best to 
 take it out and fill in with good soil to the depth of a 
 foot. Plant the bulbs in rows nine inches wide, four 

.^nches apart in the rows, and from three to four in 
 depth. It makes a very pretty bed if crocusses and 
 snow drops are planted around the bed, next to the edg- 
 ing, hyacinths next, and tulips in the centre. On the 
 approach of hard weather, the bed should be covered 
 with several iuches of leaves. Mow grass plats. After 
 they are cleared, they would be much improved by being 
 well rolled ; treated in this way they would look well the 
 remainder of the season. 

Orange Water Melon. 

This vegetable curiosity is a native of China, and if 
 what is said of it be true, the seed will be greatly in de- 
 mand next season. The rind peels off like an orange, 
 and leaves the whole of the rich luscious pulp, which 
 may be divided into parts, and is most delightfully fla- 
 vored. 

Mr. Peabody, of the "Soil of the South," has raised 
 It the present season, and if he has any seed to spare 
 the Farm Journal will be most happy to receive a part, 
 and put it in the way of distribution and trial. 

Corn Sowed for Fodder. 

We have continued to urge from time to time in our 
 Journal the great advantages of sowing corn for fodder, 
 its- nutritive character, its enormous yield per acre, and 
 its value especially in a time of drought when grass is 
 almost destroyed. Those who have followed our advice 
 in this respect last spring will now reap the benefit of 
 it. 

The following in the Valley Farmer, from an address 
 by Col. Pickering before the Essex County Agricultural 
 Society many years ago, is very pertinent to the present 
 season, and shows his sound judgement in agricultui'al 
 matters and great forsesight : 

"Every farmer knows how cagei-ly cattle devour the 
 entire plant of the Indian corn in its green state ; and 
 land in good condition will produce heavy crops of it. 
 Some years ago, just when the ears were in the milk, I 
 cut close to the ground the plants growing on a meas- 
 ured space, equal, as I judged, to the average product 
 of the whole piece ; and found that, at the same rate, 
 an acre would yield twelve tons of green fodder ; proba- 
 bly a richer and more nourishing food than any other 
 known to the husbandman. And this quantity was the 
 growth of less than four months. 

"It has appeared to me that the sort called sweet corn 
 yields stalks of richer juice than the common yellow 
 corn. It is also more disposed to multiply suckers — an 
 additional recommendation to it when planted to be cut 
 in a green state for horses and cattle, and especially for 
 milk cows ; and at the time of planting maj' be so regu- 
 lated as to furnish supplies for food just when the i^as- 
 tui'es usually fail. I am inclined to doubt whether any 
 other green food will afford butter of equal quality." 

Col. Pickering was wont to speak honestly, when oth- 
 ers regarded him as good authority. Many things which 
 appeared to him years ago, as important agricultural 
 truths, have since proved such, and among others this 
 for planting corn for green fodder. In connection with 
 Col. Pickering's remarks that the time of planting may 
 be so regulated as to furnish supplies of food just when 
 the pastures fail, we would inquire, inasmuch as corn- 
 stalks and leaves, well cured, are an excellent winter 
 food for cattle, whether the time of planting could not 
 be regulated with some reference to the prospective 
 wants of the succeeding winter. We accord most heart- 
 ily with the sentiment of an excellent article in a former 
 number of this paper, by our worthj' predecessor, in 
 which it was shown that the farmer should have the 
 general plan of the summer's campaign made out before 
 hand, should study in the winter, lay his plans for the 
 season, and then carry them out in the summer. We 
 suppose, however, there are exceptions to be made. The 
 clover on a particular field may have failed, or it may 
 have become apparent in time for sowing corn that the 
 haj- crop is going to be short. The farmer therefore 
 will find it convenient, with regard to certain fields, not 
 to have his mind unalterably made up till as late as the 
 end of June. To what extent corn fodder is destined to 
 take the place of hay, we are not certain. That it af- 
 fords an excellent fall feed for dairy purp.^sos tliere is no 
 doubt; and it is clearly ascertained that it mny, on some 
 farms at least, be profitably grown for winter fodder. 
 Much of course depends on the character of the farm.
