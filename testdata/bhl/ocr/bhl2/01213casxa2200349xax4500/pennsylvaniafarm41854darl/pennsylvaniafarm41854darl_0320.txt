and something we suppose may depend upon the season; 
 we see no reason wh^', in case of the prospect being dark 
 at the end of June for fall and winter food, the farmer 
 who has land fit for the purpose should not thrust in a few 
 acres for corn fodder, when otherwise he would not, to 
 be fed out green in early autumn or to be cured for win- 
 ter, as the case may seem to require. 

The merchants turn quickly in an emergency. To a 
 limited extent, very limited we confess, and yet not so 
 limited as to be unimportant, the farmer, for aught we 
 can see, may do the same. We advise the farmers to 
 look at this matter. 

The Best Kind of Grass for a Dry Season. 

One of our friends and subscribers from Huntingdon 
 county, F. Schreiner, writes us for our opinion of the 
 best kind of grass to suit a season of extreme drought 
 like the present. 

The capacity of any crop to bear drought depends 
 very much on the condition and depth of soil. Red clo- 
 ver, from its long and vigorous tap root, which pushes 
 down sometimes two or three feet, is a very meliorating 
 crop on the soil, and where the subsoil is open does not 
 suffer so much as others in a dry season; neither do rye 
 grass and oi'chard grass, from their very rapid growth, 
 fail so entirely as timothy or green grass. The great 
 remedy, however, for dry seasons is deep plowing and 
 subsoiling, and if the very severe and extensive droughts 
 of the present year, perhaps more general than ever be- 
 fore known, and a loss to the country, it is thought, of 
 two hundred millions of dollars, should have the effect 
 of thoroughly awakening fanners to this one fact, the 
 loss will be a gain. It makes us feel almost sick to see, 
 as we have done within a few days, plowing going on for 
 the wheat crop at an average depth of not over two and 
 a half to three inches, and where the ground perhaps 
 will not be plowed again for many years. 

Strawberry Question. 

In reference to the variations in the strawberry blos- 
 soms h^m^ permanent char act eristics, and belonging to one 
 or the other of four distinct forms of inflorescence, 
 which, according to the Cincinnati Horticultural Society, 
 are fixed and unchangeable, Dr. Kennicot, in the Prairie 
 Farmer, says : 

"In the summer of 1852 we planted a bed of Burr's 
 new pine. All the plants died from the bed except three 
 or four. These did not produce a berry in the summer 
 of 1853. The present spring the bed is very well cov- 
 ered with the plants from these four. Of course there 
 ought to be only four different varieties of pistillate or- 
 ganization to say the least. There are more than ten. 
 Where did they come from ?" 

The Doctor further says : "We expect it can be sub- 
 stantiated in a court of justice upon as good evidence as 
 ever hanged a man, that strawberries have been pro- 
 duced without impregnation." 

Bots. 
 The bots, generally speaking, are not so troublesome 
 to horses as people seem to suppose ; for it is very rare, 
 in making post mortem examinations, that we do not find 
 more or less in the stomach. We have heard some won- 
 derful stories related of the bots burrowing through the 

walls of the stomach. This we deny in toto, at least 
 while the horse is alive. The little creature is too com- 
 fortably located to attempt its exit into a cavity where 
 its destruction would be inevitable. If it be about to 
 vacate its stronghold, instinct teaches it the most safe and 
 expeditious route, which is the alimentary canal. We 
 do not deny that bots are found in the abdominal ca\'ity, 
 for the moment the horse dies all the various organs are 
 subject to the laws of decomposition. Chemical action, 
 which, during life, was regulated by the vital forces, now 
 assumes the supremacy. Those powerful solvents term- ' 
 ed the gastric fluids, which had previously dissolved 
 nothing but food, now act on the stomach itself, and has- 
 ten its decomposition ; and what had previously been 
 good food for bots is now their bane, and they must 
 themselves in turn be destroyed unless they escape from 
 it. The peristaltic motion of the alimentary canal, 
 which, during the existence of the horse, was so favora- 
 ble to their exit by that channel had ceased. They are 
 too well acquainted with the inti-icate, labyrinthian out- 
 let (their usual route,) to attempt its passage. No. 
 The same energies of one eternal mind, 

"Pervading ami Instructing all that live," 
 suggests the only means of escape. The stomach now 
 offering but little opposition to them, being partly de- 
 composed, they burst their prison-house, and hence are 
 found in the abdominal cavity. And here they may be 
 said to have jumped "from the frying pan into the fire." 
 We are frequently called upon to visit sick horses, said 
 to have the "bots," when there is no more connection 
 between them and the disease than there is between the 
 horse and the anvil on which his shoes are forged. It iaf 
 all very well for us to say "a horse has the bots," and 
 prescribe some medicine for their expulsion ; but there 
 is no practical advantage gained ; neither is the horse 
 benefitted by such decision or treatment. For most 
 of the remedies used as vermifuges would kill the 
 horse, while the former would not be injured in the 
 slightest degree. Mr. Bracey Clark says, "The slow- 
 ness of the growth of bots, and the purity of their 
 food, which is probably the chyle, must occasion what 
 they receive in a given time to be proportionably small ; 
 from which, perhaps, arises the extreme difficulty of de-* 
 stroying them by any medicine or poison thrown into 
 the stomach. After opium had been administered to a 
 horse laboring under a locked jaw for a week, in doses 
 of one ounce every day, bots were found in the stomach | 
 perfectly alive. Tobacco has been employed in much 
 larger quantities in the same complaint, and has also 
 been continued without destroying them." Mr. White, 
 V. S., says, "While making experiments on glanders, I 
 found living bots in the stomach of a horse, though he 
 had been taking for many days arsenic and corrosive 
 sublimate."* Mr. Blaine says, "that he has kept them 
 alive for some days in olive oil, and in oil of turpentine, 
 and that even the nitrous and sulphuric acids do not im- 
 mediately destroy them." The history and habits of the 
 bot are thus alluded to by Mr. Clark: "Bots are not, 
 properly speaking, worms, but the larvae of the gadfly. 

*Very nice articles to experiment wKh, truly! And yet we are 
 sorry to say that experiments— for they cannot be called" any thing 
 else— are daily made in this city with agents whose therapeutic pow- 
 ers are so diversified that the wisest cf the faculty have never ven- 
 tured to lix limits to their action, They are like the torch in the hands 
 of an incendiary. The healthy parts must sufl'er equally with the 
 diseased.
