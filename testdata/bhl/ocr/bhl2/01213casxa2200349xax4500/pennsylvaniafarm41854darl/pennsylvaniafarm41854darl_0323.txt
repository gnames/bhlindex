and our good. Such distinctive features in the season 
 present the most convincing facts, and prove clearly the 
 all wise designs of the Governor and Ruler of the Uni- 
 verse. Philosophers may trace eifects back to causes 
 made to tlicm manifest, but the great first cause is truly 
 least understood, and some may lay the cause to the to- 
 tal eclipse, and so on. Paul may plant and AppoUos may 
 ■water, but God alone giveth the increase. Then is to 
 the faithful who unerringly follows true principles and 
 the dictates of reason, a clear advantage physically as 
 well as morally. 

What beautiful adaptation. Tlie skillful husbandman 
 will have bis recompense in an equal ratio to his obser- 
 Tance of the laws that regulate all animate and inani- 
 mate tilings. The slothful, indolent and unobservant 
 farmer lays it all to the season, and contemns the gov- 
 ernment of all; while the trul}^ scientific farmer will be 
 gratified with the greater contrast thus made more appa- 
 rent under the dispensation of an unfruitful season. He 
 plows deep, haiTOWS firm, keeps a vigilant eye and hands 
 ever readj' to meet, and as far as possible, counteracts 
 the seasons of drought that so frequently occur 
 here ; while he fails never to restore to the grateful 
 earth the residue or excrenientious parts of all plants 
 consumed or used on his farm, and within his reach. 
 While the indolent and unskillful farmer grieves his very 
 life at the events of providence, and fears to stir or even 
 hoe his potatoes, least the drouth should eat them up. 
 How unwise ! The greater drouth the still greater ne- 
 cessity of pulverising and keeping the soil open to the 
 sensative impressions of the dews constantly distilling 
 on the ever recurring day. You can discover in the rail 
 road car, if it is within the limits of proper care for 
 tr.ivelling safely, one of those characters from the other. 
 This is truly gratifying to the enlightened farmer and 
 philanthi'opist. It is remunerating ; to the pleasure 
 some profit is added. I had only thought of saying that 
 the di-y and hot summer we have had has aflFected crops 
 of all descriptions very seriously ; but the spring wheat 
 is far better than expectations, and now whitening and 
 ready for the hai-vest. Some have cut. AVinter wheat 
 has suffered from winter killing. 

In future it would be wise to endeavor to meet similar 
 seasons by sowing a substitute for hay, corn or oats. 
 Indeed all would do well to cut and secure in good sea- 
 son the straw and stalks, and husband them carefully. 
 If the farmers would adopt more generallj^ a rotation of 
 crops they would secure against failures, in hay crops in 
 particular. In passing through our county, I observed 
 one man haying who had more than twice as much hay 
 on the same ground as his neighbors, and thought, for 
 the sake of gratifying my curiositj', I would ask him 
 ■why it was. ! I don' know, says Samivel — he was a 
 cannie Scot — I generally give ten or twelve quarts of 
 seed, when the neighbors say they give only sax, and 
 that no a' I seed down a new piece every year. Right, 
 says I, you can never give too much seed for grass. If 
 I do, says he, I can jist plow it down. 
 . I should be glad to hear from you, and assist in any 
 ■way the circulation of your valuable and reliable Farm 
 Journal. Our county takes more agricultural papers 
 than any of its population in the State, but have got in 
 the habit of taking those from the Empire State on the 

same score of many other things. We seem to have had 
 no choice. Yours, P. FALCONER.

Domestic Recipes. 

Te.\. Cake. — One quart of sour milk, half a tea cup of 
 molasses, a tea spoonful of salreratus; break into the 
 milk two eggs, a little ginger, a little salt, and nutmeg ; 
 stir in flour till it becomes a thick batter ; then turn it 
 into a well greased pan, and bake twenty minutes. 

Cream Cake. — One pound of flour, one pound of su- 
 gar, half a pound of butter, half a pint of cream, four 
 eggs, one pound of currants, a tea spoonful of salsera- 
 tus, a table spoonful of rose water, or a glass of brandy; 
 spice to your taste. 

Apple Snow. — Put twelve good tart apples in cold 
 water, and set them over a slow fire ; when soft, drain 
 off the water, strip the skins off the apples, core them, 
 and lay them in a deep dish. Beat the whites of twelve 
 eggs to a stiff frcth; put half a pound of powdered 
 white sugar to the apples, beat them to a stiff froth, and 
 add the beaten eggs. Beat the whole to a stiff snow, 
 then turn it into a dessert dish, and oi-nament it with 
 myrtle or box. 

Pumpkin Pie. — Stew the pumpkin dry, and make it 
 like squash pie, only season rather higher. In the coun- 
 tiy, where this real yankee pie is prepared in perfection, 
 ginger is almost always used with other spices. There, 
 too, part cream instead of milk is mixed with the pump- 
 kin, which gives it a richer flavor. Roll the paste rath- 
 er thicker than for fruit pies, as there is but one crust. 
 If the pie is large and deep, it will require to bake an 
 hour in a brisk oven. 

Family Mince Pies. — Boil three pounds of lean beef 
 till tender, and when cold chop it fine. Chop three 
 pounds of clear beef suet, and mix the meat, sprinkling 
 in a table spoonful of salt. Pare, core and chop fine six 
 pounds of good apples ; stone four pounds of raisins and 
 chop them ; wash and dry two pounds of currants ; and 
 mix them all well with the meat. Season with a spoon- 
 ful of powdered cinnamon, a powdered nutmeg, a little 
 mace, and a few cloves, pounded, and one pound of 
 brown sugar ; add a quart of Madeira wine .and half a 
 pound of citron cut into small bits. This mixture put 
 do'wn in a stone jar and closely covered will keep several 
 weeks. It makes a rich pie for Thanksgiving and Christ- 
 mas. 

Cabbage Soup. — Boil corned beef in a pot of water 
 until half done, then add two small heads of cabbage, 
 cut in quarters, and well washed (examine carefully, as 
 insects are sometimes concealed between the leaves) ; 
 when it is done tender, take out the largest pieces and 
 drain them in a colander, and set it over a pot of hot 
 water to keep it hot ; if the meat is tender, take that up 
 also, and add to the soup a cup of pearl-barley or rice, 
 a dozen or more potatoes peeled and cut in half ; two or 
 three turnips and some sliced or giated carrots — if liked 
 an onion or two may also be added ; let it boil until the 
 vegetables are all done ; put the meat on a large dish, 
 and the cabbage and other vegetables on small dishes, 
 for side dishes. This makes a good family dinner. 
 Serve the soup in a tureen, hot ; thicken with a table 
 spoonful of flour made in thin paste with water.
