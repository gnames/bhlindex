Monstrous Wheat Head. 
 We have had the following wood cut made from one in 
 the English Gardeners' Chronicle, which we give to our 
 readers with the remarks of the editor. The head pre- 
 sents the singular appearance of having incipient lateral 
 branches or spikelets, and it would appear a reasonable 
 presumption that by selecting and cultivating such as 
 had this tendency, in the course of time additional 
 branched heads might be formed, and a permanent char- 
 acter established. The trouble of going over a wheat 
 field, and selecting even a very few lai'ge and well de- 
 veloped heads, cultivating these by themselves, and se- 
 lecting from them again, and continuing the process for 
 a few years, would no doubt result in great improvement 
 of seed and productiveness, and at a very small cost. 
 The Baden corn was produced in this way by a long se- 
 ries of careful selections, commencing with such as had 
 two and three eai's to the stalk and ended in getting such 
 as had eight and ten. The establishment of peculiari- 
 ties, either in animals or vegetables, is necessarily a 
 woik of time, but there is enough known of progressive 
 improvements in various kinds of vegetables to induce 
 greater care and labor in selecting seeds. 

The bead represented by the engraving was found by 
 Professor Heuslow in one of his allotments. The editor 
 of the Chronicle says : 

"It will be seen that at each 
 of the places marked a a a 
 there is an additional body, 
 having a very distinct reflex- 
 ed position ; and that at 6 a 
 similar though different ap- 
 pearance occurs. Upon ex- 
 amining the structures care- 
 fully, we find that at a a a 
 there is, in addition to the 
 usual spikelet, a lateral one, 
 consisting of imperfect chaffs 
 [(jlumes -Awik palea') containing 
 from two to three florets. 
 This additional spikelet occu- 
 pies the same position as one 
 of the regular lateral one- 
 flowered spikelets of barley. 
 At b there is an additional 
 chaflF or glume, reflexed as 
 before, but imperfect, and 
 ** merely indicating a tendency 
 in other parts of the ear to 
 assume the peculiar condition 
 of a a a. 

"We entertain little doubt 
 that, in this example, we have 
 before us the elements of that 
 greater change which ulti- 
 mately resulted in the produc- 
 tion of Egyptian wheat out of 
 the common Revett or Triti- 
 cum durum; and if this be so, 
 we have evidence that the 
 common red or white wheats 
 may also be expected to branch 
 in the ear, and thus acquire a 
 degree of productiveness at 
 present unknown among them. 
 "Now that all eyes arc upon 
 wheat fields, we, as botanists, 
 would direct attention to this fact, and suggest the pro- 
 priety of putting aside any ears in the condition of that 
 now represented, with a view to sowiug the corn apart, 

for the sake of the possibility that the tendency to 
 branch may be strengthened and perpetuated. It is en- 
 tirely consistent with all we know of the nature of plants 
 that this should occur ; not, indeed, in every seedling 
 obtained from a branching ear, but in some one of them. 
 Such a case should again be reserved and sown apart; and 
 if but one case of a branched e.ar should occur in the third 
 generation, the habit of branching may be regarded as 
 fixed ; while the degree of it may be expected to go at 
 least as far as in the Egj'ptian wheat. 

"This is a point to which the attention more especially 
 of allotment-holders should be directed. It is even 
 worth consideration whether it might not be desirable to 
 sharpen the perception of the allottees by oflFering some 
 small rewards for each branched ear that should be 
 brought in."
