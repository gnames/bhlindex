a constant strain on the gate, holding it fast when shut, 
 and drawing it shut when open, simply by the play up 
 and down on his hinges (spike), the shoulders of which 
 are made long enough to admit of the gate raising suffi- 
 ciently for ingress or egress. It may be applied to large 
 or small gates, only requiring a catch of some kind be- 
 hind to hold it open for riding or driving through. 

A thousand ladies were estimated to be on the ground 
 at one time. A lecture on agricultural chemistry was 
 delivered on the ground to a very attentive audience by 
 George E. Waring, author of the "Elements of Agricul- 
 ture" noticed in oar September number. He seemed to 
 us to have a remarkable facility for illustrating his sub- 
 ject, and answered all the questions put to him with en- 
 tire promptness. Our practical farmers were much 
 pleased with his address. So ready and capable a lec- 
 turer would confer a vast amount of good through Penn- 
 sylvania could his services be engaged to visit every 
 county society. lie is one of the few lecturers on agri- 
 cultural chemistry, who, appearing to thoroughly un- 
 derstand his subject matter, divests it at the same time 
 of all obtuscness. An address was also delivered by 
 John S. Bowen, which we were prevented from hearing, 
 but which is highly spoken of. 

The Horticultural Exhibition occurred at the same 
 time as the Agricultural, thus dividing many of the con- 
 tributions. Most of the fruit was taken to the Horticul- 
 tural, and also probably of the vegetables. The latter 
 surprised every one by their quantity and quality. The 
 season for fruit trees being so unpropitious, the display 
 was of course meag\"e. There were, however, some very 
 fine peaches exhibited by J. William Thorne, and the 
 famous Jeifries apples in great perfection. The display 
 of flowers and green house plants was thought to sur- 
 pass all previous exhibitions. West Chester is, we be- 
 lieve, the only inland town in the State, except Pitts- 
 burg, which flourishes and supports both an Agricultural 
 and Horticultural Society. The Hall of the latter cost 
 about $6,000, and we believe is the second one in the 
 Union built by a Horticultural Society for horticultural 
 purposes. 

Hereafter it will probably be found better to hold the 
 two exhibitions scpai-ate and at different periods in the 
 fall. The display in each will then be more complete, as 
 there will then be no interference.

We have repeatedly called the attention of the readers 
 of the Farm Journal to the fact, that painted surfaces 
 exposed to the weather should in all cases possible be 
 painted in the fall, winter or early spring. The best 
 time in the year is in November and December. This, 
 experience has abundantly shown. 

On exposed surfaces, painted in the warmer portion of 
 the year, it will be found that the oil has commenced 
 "leaving the paint" in one, two or three years, according 
 to the quality of the materials used. In passing the 
 hand over it portions will adhere, and every rain will 
 carry off these loose particles, so that in a very few years 
 the paint if not removed" will all disappear. On the oth- 
 er hand, if reasonably good material be used and put on 
 in the months indicated, the paint will last twice or 
 thrice as long, thus saving the cost of one or two rencw-

J. L. Darlington, Esq. : — Dear Sir : — I have been 
 furnished by the Light House Board with samples of 
 diff'crcnt kind.s of Colza, which have been, I believe, im- 
 ported in the hope of turning the attention of our agri- 
 culturists to its cultivation. You are aware that in 
 France the oil of Colza is much u.sed in the arts, and 
 both in France and England, it has taken the place of 
 sperm oil for light house illumination. In England it is 
 furnished at 89 cents per gallon, and 40 per cent less 
 than the cost of spermaceti oil. Is it not worth the trial 
 in some parts of this country? 

I shall be happy to furnish yourself or any of your 
 friends, who may wish to plant the Colza, with such sam- 
 ples as they may prefer. 

I enclose a translation of the article Colza, in the 
 Nouvlan Cours Complet D'Agricultnre.

Colsat or Coka: Bleracea Braspiea.^-Thiii name is common- 
 ly given to a variety of cabbage, the least removed from the 
 type oftbe species, and cultivated principally for its seed, 
 which furnishes an oil valuable in the Arts. It is known 
 by its radical leaves, which are petiolated. siniiated, or 
 slightly incised; sometimes even pinnated at their "base, 
 and by its cauline or head leaves, which are sessile and 
 eordiform. Both sets smooth, and of a yellowish-green 
 color; vary often in size, but are always smaller than in 
 other varieties. 

There are two sub-varieties of Colza — l<t. with white 
 leaves, 2d, with yellow leaves. These latter are larger, thick- 
 er, and more patient of winter than the former, and the plant 
 that bears them is therefore cultivated in preference. 

Such cultivation cannot be carried on in all localities, 
 some of which are cntirelj' unsuitable. In France it is 
 only pursued to some extent in the plains of what was for- 
 merly Flanders. It would be uselessly attempted in the 
 southern departments, where there are often prolonged 
 droughts, and where water for irrigation is scanty. The 
 character of the soil must be above all considered. In a 
 sandy soil the stem of the plant is weak, and the grain 
 small; amid clays it vegetates slowly, turns yellow soon, 
 and yields but little oil. An intermediate soil, a loam, light 
 and rich, i. e., the best wheat land, is the only one that 
 properly suits it; and such a soil must have besides a good 
 depth, and requires to be well worked and highly manured. 
 Sown broadcast in the fall, it furnishes in the spring a green 
 crop for use, and in this respect it is very iidvantngeous in 
 many circumstances; still for this even, other varieties of 
 cabbage are jireferable. It may be profitably seeded, too, 
 in order to being turned under when in flower. 

In some districts Colza is cultivated like rape — >'. c, sown 
 broadcast at once in the field: l)ut experience has shown that 
 the best method is to sow first in a bed, and then plant 
 as other cabbage. 

Ground intended for seeding Colza is genendly chosen 
 in the neighborhood of the dwelling, so as to be able to 
 take more regular care of the operation which it rcftuires. 
 It is worked with the spade better than with the plough; 
 and it must be manured in proportion fo its iintiir.al jiovertj
