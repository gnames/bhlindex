[October 

or the exhaustion from previoiw crops. Its surface, made 
 as even as possible by harrowing and rolling, is divided 
 into squares of 4 and 5 feet, separated by furrows or tracks 
 a foot wide. 

Seeding is generally done in July. The grain should 
 be put in as uniformly as possible, and in small quantity, 
 so that the plants should not grow up too crowded. The 
 plants after they come up are watered in a drought, and are 
 thinned and weeded as may be necessary. 

In England, where good farmers have generally adopted 
 the method of seeding in ranges orfurrows, a similar method 
 is followed with Co'za— i'. e., little furrows, 6 or 8 inches 
 apart, aie made with the awk end of the rake, and the seed 
 is dropped in by pinches, aud covered up with a stroke of 
 the rake. While the plants are growing in the Colza bed, 
 the ground intended for planting is being prepared. 

The iield for it is almost always one which has borne 
 wheat that season. There is always profit in manuring 
 afresh, though this is often omitted- The manure should 
 be ploughed in first a. little after wheat harvest; a second 
 ploughing should follow in the first half of September, and 
 a third some tim? in October. The ploughing should be 
 jvs deep as convenient, and crossed in order to break up 
 the soil more. 

It is probable that salt enii'loyed in its cultivation would 
 hasten the'vegetation, as it does that of flax and hemp. 

A single spading w.ould supply the place of three plough- 
 ings, but the expense of it does not allow it, except on small 
 pkmtation worked by the proprietor or the tenant by his 
 own labor and that of his family; labor which, happily for 
 a"riculture- is counted for nothing, otherwise many opera- 
 tions would go undone, did we calculate beforehand the 
 trouble they cost and. thsmouey they return. 

In all cases the laud should be laid in raised beds, in 
 order to discharge surplus water; and little drains should 
 bo made with the same view, if the nature of the soil and 
 lay of the land require them. 

The month of October is the most proper for transplant- 
 ing Colza. Weather cloudy, even a little showery, should 
 be chosen, that the plants may take more readily. The 
 plants are removed from the seed bed, not by hand pulling, 
 but a mattock, handling the roots and leaves with the 
 utmost care, and are carried in baskets to the field. 

The best form for the plantation is a quincunx — i. c, 
 parallel rows breaking joint alternately — 15 to 18 inches 
 apart, and they should bo set with a mattock rather too deep 
 than too shallow; fjr what is called the stem in cabbages is 
 only the prolong.ition of the root, and this prolongation 
 being susceptible of throwing out new fibrils, the plant is 
 better nourished. 

If necessary to plant quick{y, one person makes the holes 
 and another puts in the plants and covers up, not pressing 
 the earth too much around the roots, for that both constrainis 
 the position of the plant and embarrasses the root fibres. 

In November, if the weather allows, plants that have not 
 taken are replaced, or this operation is postponed till early 
 next spring. Either way, a proportionate number of plants 
 is resei-ved in the seed bod for the purpose. 

Planting Colza with the plough is so easy and economical 
 that it is astonishing this method is not more generally 
 practised. The only inconvenience with it is, that the plant 
 does not always set straight, but it becomes so, and whether 
 mueh or little loaning it can be brought up with a short 
 prop. 

The plantation is touched no more until March, or even 
 April, according to the season. Then it is hood, and the 
 stalk is ridged or hilled. The drains, if there are any, are 
 cleaned out, and the earth fr:ini them is thrown ou the 

ridges. In May a second hoeing is given like the former. 
 In the northern Departments of France, where colza is 
 much raised, its grain is generally ripe towards the end of 
 July; more to the southward it may be a month earlier. 
 The state of the weather also concurs to advance or retard 
 the epoch of its maturity. When it should be gathered 
 is known by the yellowness of the stalk and falling of the 
 lower loaves. As the greatest quantity and best quality of 
 the oil results from perfect ripeness, and as when the seed 
 is left to ripen on the stulk a good deal must be lost, the 
 skill of the cultivator is in choosing the proper time for 
 balancing between these two. 

When from being too late gathering, or from some acci- 
 dent, the grain has been scattered, some amends may be 
 had by harrowing it in; then furnishing an abundant pas- 
 ture, or at least a vegetable manure. 

The stalks of colza, when the grain is ripe, are cut with 
 a sickle close to the ground. Morning is best for this, 
 in order that the shaking which in spite of all care, the 
 cutting will occasion, may cause the least loss, the pods 
 swelled by dampness of night having then less tendency to 
 open. The stalks are placed in a cart and conveyed to largo 
 barracks, whose floor is close onu clean, where they are laid 
 in heaps, but without being pressed, so as to allow in fact, a 
 circulation of air around the branches. There the seed con- 
 tinues to ripen from the sap which remains in the stem, and 
 which evaporates very slowlj-. 

Where there is no barrack for the purpose, ricks are 
 made in the field itself, or some convenient place, with the 
 cabbage heads and straw in alternating layers. The tops 
 and sides of the ricks are then thatched with straw so as 
 to keep ofi' the rain. 

When the stalks are perfectly dried, they are threshed 
 either on the barn floor or on a treading floor made in the 
 field, in order to separate the seed from the pod — an opera- 
 tion very easy and very rapid. The grain is then winnowed 
 as wheat is, sifted, and cleaned by all possible means from 
 foreign substances; for the cle.aner it is the less it attracts 
 moisture, and consequently the sounder it keeps. 

As the grain, although coming from stalks perfectly dry, 
 (which is, however, not alwaj's attended to,) contains still 
 a superabundance of moisture, it is good to spread it for 
 several days upon sheets, turning it over often, in order to 
 hasten the expulsion of this moisture. Then it is put in 
 sacks, which must be emptied and refilled every fortnight 
 until it is carried to the mill. With these precautions the 
 grain is kept without moulding or heating, and yields 
 abundance of oil, and of excellent quality. 

When the grain is pressed too soon it yields less oil, 
 and of inferior grade. When the pressing is put ofi' too 
 lato there is still less yield, and the oil is rancid. In 
 the first instance, the mucilage has not had time to be- 
 come transformed into oil; in the second, the grains them- 
 selves become more or less decayed, or spoil in some other 
 manner. 

The beginning of winter, before the heavy frosts, is ordi- 
 narily the time for expressing the oil; and this is in fact 
 the most favorable period in all regards. 

The mode of expressing colza oil does not difi"or from 
 that employed for other oil-yielding grain. 

The mass of the grain after expression of the oil is 
 called tourtoau trouillo, or pain de trouille. It is given to 
 cattle, to cows and pigs especially, which are very fond 
 of it, and fatten rapidly on it; or it may be applied to the 
 land, which it helps almost as much as stable manure. 

Every time a healthy leaf is pulled ofi' from a vegetable, 
 especially a vegetable which has leaves so few and so large 
 as colza, its growth is hurt, and, therefore, also its flowers
