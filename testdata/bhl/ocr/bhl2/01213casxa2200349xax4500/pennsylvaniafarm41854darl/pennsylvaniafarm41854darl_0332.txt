Lime from Oyster Shells. 

It is generally known that oyster shells, when buvneil 
 in a kiln, make lime of the purest and best quality ; yet 
 notwithstanding this they are rarely used for this pur- 
 pose. We have known instances of fanners hauling 
 lime for their land over fifteen miles, and iu some in- 
 stances the limestone, when hundreds of bushels of oys- 
 ter sheUs could have been had for nothing at oyster sel- 
 lers near at hand. 

The manner of burning oyster shells is almost identi- 
 cal with that of burning lime in a stone coal kiln, with 

alternate layers of shells and small coal â€” the proportions 
 used being about the same as when limestone is used. 
 Lime made from oyster shells is free from the causticity 
 of much of that burned from gtone, and therefore far 
 preferable for all horticultural purposes. 

As an evidence of its purity we may state, that the 
 West Chester Gas Company use oyster shell lime for 
 purifying the gas in preference to all others. They have 
 a small kiln at their establishment, in which they burn 
 the shells obtained from the different oystermen in the 
 borough. 

WOOLMAN'S PATENT FARM GATE. 

The above engraving represents Woolman's Patent I demand both for fruit and ornamental trees the present

 while sitting in the carriage, by a gentle pull on a cord, it to do, that the object of planting any kind of a tree or 

that comes right in the way, unlatch, open and fasten it 
 open; and on riding through, a slight jerk on a corres- 
 ponding cord closes and latches it. The cost over an 
 ordinary gate is trifling, and its ittilit}/ will be perceived 
 at a glance. II. Kimber has purchased the right for this 
 county. 

Planting Trees. 

Before our next number reaches its readers, the plant- 
 ing season will have arrived. The public mind is fully 
 awakened to the importance of making good use of each 
 of these semi-annual periods, and from what we hear it 
 is highly probable all our nurseries will be sold out more 
 bare this ftill than ever before. The large number of 
 farms and pleasant sites, brought into view for the first 
 time by the opening of new railroad routes, the increas- 
 ing taste in all our large cities for suburban residences, 
 the subdivision of farms, &c., all contribute to make the 

bush is to make it grow and thrive, and not merely to 
 stick it in the ground so that it won't blow over. AVe 
 are satisfied this is a new idea to some persons, and as 
 there is a "trade" in every thing, we would recommend 
 those whose trade or profession may have always been 
 in the city, to engage their planting to be done by some 
 one who has made a trade of learning to do it right, and 
 if he really knows how to do it, as he ought to know, 
 the expense will be re-paid ten times over. To those 
 who prefer attending to it themselves, and there are 
 many both in town and country, whose pursuits have led 
 them into a different channel, but who could most readily 
 and easily succeed with the aid of a little plain theory, 
 we recommend the purchase of Downing's, Thomas', or 
 Barry's fruit books for insti-uction in the management of 
 every kind of fruit trees from first to last, and also Mee- 
 han's hand book of ornamental trees and shrubs. The 
 latter contains a complete list and description of the
