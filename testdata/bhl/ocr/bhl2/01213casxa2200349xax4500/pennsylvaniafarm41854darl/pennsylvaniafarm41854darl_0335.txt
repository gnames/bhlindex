Doctor. — Raised by Prof. Kirt- 

lanJ iu 1842. The tree is of licalthj' 
 habit, not extremely vigorous, up- 
 right, rounded in form, bearing even 
 to excess of fruit, so much so that 
 unless well cultivated the fruit be- 
 comes small. Original soil, gravelly 
 loam. 

Fruit, medium, roundish heart, 
 shade, with a suture extending all 
 round ; color, light yellow and red, 
 the latter most prevailing ; flesh, 
 white, tinged with pale yellow, juicy, 
 tender, sweet, with a delicious fla- 
 vor ; pit, small ; stem, rather slen- 
 der, in a round regular basin. It 
 ripens early in June, but will hang 
 until July. 

Late r.JC.AKF.EAU. — Raised by 
 Ti-of. Kirtlaiid in 1842, on a gra- 
 velly soil. Tree vigorous, shoots 
 stone and rampant, forms a round 
 regular head ; flowers, open, 
 abundant, very productive. 

Fruit, large, obtuse heart 
 shape, occasionally a little angu- 
 lar and with a deep broad inden- 
 ture at the apes ; color, a rich 
 yellow ground, with a bright red 
 clieek, frequently the red covers 
 nearly the whole surface — occa- 
 sionally it is blotched or mottled; 
 suture, shallow, half round, 
 marked with a line on opposite 
 side : flesh, with distinct radia- 
 ting lines, yellowish, ne;irly firm, 
 juicy, sweet, and of agreeable 
 tl.ivi.r; pit, small, round, regular; 
 stalk, one and a half inch long, 
 inserted in a hi-oad open depres-

Kirtlaxd's Mary. — Raised 
 by Trof. Kirtland in 1842, de- 
 scribed and named hy Elliott, 
 in compliment to the daughter 
 of Prof. K. The tree is a strong 
 healthy grower, upright, round- 
 ed in form, shoots strong, not 
 rampant ; flowers, large and 
 open, very prolific. The fruit 
 is one of the most beautiful of 
 all cherries, quite firm-fleshed, 
 but withal possessing delicacy 
 and high flavor, that renders it 
 one of the most desirable varie- 
 ties, either for dessert or mar- 
 ket purposes. 

Fruit, large, roundish, heart 
 shape, very regular; color, light 
 and dark rich red, deeplj' mar- 
 bled and mottled on a yellow 
 ground, grown fully in the sun, 
 is mostly a i-ich, dark glossy red; 
 flesh, with distinct irregular radiating lines, light yel- 
 low, quite firm, rich, juicy, sweet and very high flavor- 
 ed ; pit, medium, regular, rounded, with distinct promi- 
 nent lines or ridges, flesh adheres slightly to it ; stem, 
 moderately stout, varying in length. Season, last of 
 June and first of July. 

Favorite. — Raised by Prof. Kirt- 
 land in 1842 ; gravelly soil. Tree, 
 vigorous, half spreading, productive. 

Fruit, medium, round, regular, 
 slightly compressed ; color, pale am- 
 ber yellow, with a bright carmine red 
 cheek, mottled and marbled ; flesh, 
 pale amber, translucent, delicate, ju- 
 icy and sweet ; pit, small; stem, me- 
 dium, inserted in an even basin. 
 Season, last of June. This variety 
 requires high cultivation, otlierwise 
 the fruit is small, and ihe flavor only 
 good. 

Jefferis Apple. 

We gave in our second volume, page 20o, an engrav- 
 ing and description of this superior seedling apple. 
 Since that time it has received favorable notice and pi"e- 
 miums from many of the Horticultural Societies of the 
 country, and although we do not know that it has yet 
 been fruited out of Chester county, it continues each 
 year to sustain and confirm its first representation, and 
 we think for this section at least should be cultivated by 
 every farmer and fruit grower. 

It is to our taste altogether unsurpassed, if not un- 
 equalled. Its beautiful appearance, juicj', rich, sub-acid 
 flavor, melting and tender flesh, almost like a pear, 
 will place it at the head of dessert apples in its season. 

Isaac Jefl'eris, on whoso place the original tree is now 
 growing, informs us it is this year loaded with fruit, 
 having at least twenty bushels on it. It also bore well 
 last year. That it should bear so well this season, when 
 there is almost literally no fruit of account throughout 
 this district, is an addition to its other recommenda- 
 tions. 

iMthough of so exceedingly tender flesh, we never ob- 
 served any tendency to rot in the inside, but in all the 
 many bushels we have seen we hardlj' recollect a single 
 imperfect specimen. It is probably too tender an apple 
 to bear extensive carriage. Paschall Morris & Co., nur- 
 serymen of this place, have propagated it extensively 
 and inform us they have had applications from various 
 distant places for both trees and scions. 

Information Wanted. 
 A subscriber, who failed to have his corn ground limed 
 last spring, desires to know whether it would be bettor 
 to lime the corn stalk land, or wait until the next i-ota- 
 tion of crops. He desires to lime the ground, but wish- 
 es to do it to the best ailvantnge. 'Will our readers 
 whose experience will warrant them to speak knowingly 
 on this subject answer ? 

Prepared Guano. 
 Kentish's Prepared Guano, advertised in the Journal, 
 we have been informed, is a valuable article, and its fer- 
 tilizing qualities, no less than its low price ($20 per ton), 
 is rapidly bringing it into favor.
