THE FARM JOFRXAL. 

326 

These two hoifers were the best animals of their age in 
 Mr. Townley's herd. 

Biichens 64tht was bred by Mr. Bates. She is that deep 
 riuh red, so characteristic of this familj', and which we so 
 much admire. She was calved in August, 1849, and is by 
 2d Duke of Oxford (9.049,) dam Duchess 66th, by 4th Duke 
 of Northumberland (3,649.) She has the clear waxy color 
 of the horn at the base, which Mr. Bates so much liked, and 
 which was a peculiar trait in the old Duchess tribe, as bred 
 by Sir Hugh Smithsons, afterwards Duke of Northumber- 
 land, and subsequently by Mr. Charles Colling. She is of 
 medium size, and not quite so fine in the head as Lallah 
 Rookh; but on acconut of her breeding,— to say nothing of 
 herself alone, — 'We would give more for her than any other 
 cow Mr. Thorne has. See was purchased at the late Earl 
 Ducie's sale, who bought her at that of the executors of Mr. 
 Bates. She cost 600 guineas — S.3,000. 

Due hc8>i 59th,is a clear rich ro.an. She was also bred by 
 Mr. Bates and purchased of Earl Ducie, She was calved 
 November, 1847, and is by 2nd Duke of Oxford (9,046.) dam 
 Duchess 5(')th, by 2d Duke of Northumberland (3,646.) She 
 is large size, stylish, and fine. She cost 360 guineas — $1, 
 760. Darlhig is a deep red, and much like Duchess 64th in 
 some respects. She is to be commended for her fine shoul- 
 der, fore-rib and great quarter. She was calved June, 1850, 
 and is by Grand Duke (10,284,) dam Now Year's Day, by 
 2d Cleveland Lad (3408.) She was bred by Capt. Dilke, of 
 Masstoke Castle. 

Peri is also by Grand Duke, dam Pink, by 2d Duke of 
 York (5959.) She was calved June, 1852, and is a deep rich 
 roan. She is fine all over, and about as perfect as Lallah 
 Rookh. She has unfortunately had one horn knocked oif 
 by accident, which detracts a trifle from her appearance, 
 but does no other injury. She was bred by Mr. Bolden, of 
 Lancashire. 

Aurora by 3d Duke of York (10,106) dam Allspice, by 2d 
 Duke of Northumberland (3,646,) is another superb animal. 

She is red and white, and was calved April, 1851. She 
 has a fine bull calf at her foot, nearly red, got by 5th Duke 
 of York. She was bred by Mr. Trotter, ofMiddleham. 

Mijsterii was bred by the late Earl Ducie. She is red 
 with scattered white hairs. Calved May, 1850, and is by 
 Ursurer (9,763.) dam Minstrel, by Count Conrad (3,510.) 

In shape Ac, she resembles Duchess 59th. She has a 
 bull calf, dropped in March, by the Duke of Gloster. He is 
 a deep rich roan, very fine head and eyes, and styliaih like 
 his dam. All the cows with the exception of Darling, we 
 believe, have been bred to Grand Duke; besides several 
 other fine thorough-bred Short-horn cows which do not par- 
 ticularize. 

Young Blaeo is nearly all red and is a splendid yearling 
 bull. He is by Blaco (9,918,) dam Ellen Gwynne, by Sir 
 Harry (10,819.) Mr. Thorne used him some in his herd this 
 summer. 

The above are only a portion of the superb Short-horns on 
 Mr. Thome's farm: yet, lost we should fatigue our readers, 
 we forbear further description of them, and turn to the other 
 animals. 

Working Cattle. — On no farm have we found four such 
 splendid pair of working cattle as at Thornedale. They 
 are red, and partake largely of Devon and a cross of Short- 
 horn blood. Two of the pairs came from Connecticut, and 
 are like the superb workers one finds in Hartford county. 
 The two other pair are from Otsego county, so famous for 
 breeding fine oxen. One pair of these were recently weigh- 
 ed, and found to be over 4000 lbs. They can be worked on 
 either side, are perfectly gentle, yet quick and powerful. 
 When beef was so high last spring, Mr. Thorne was ofiTered 
 $300 a pair for them; and though hard at work at that time, 
 they were undoubtedly better beef than half the pretended 
 fat cattle which are weekly brought to this market. We 
 hope Mr. T will exhibit these noble animals, as well as 
 others of his stock, at the forthcoming show of the State 
 Agricultural Society in this city, in October. 

Horses. — Mr. Edwin Thorne has a fine, stout, fast-troting 
 mare, with a splendid filly colt at her foot. She is by the 
 troting stallion Jupiter out of Gipsey, by the Long Island 
 Black Hawk, by Andrew Jackson, <fec. This colt has an un- 
 commonly elegant set of the nock .and head, and is about 
 as near right, all over, as one could desire. She will un- 
 questionably make a fast, stout, and enduring horse when 
 full grown. There is no more valuable stock in the world, 
 than the well-bred trotters of the United States. 

South-down Shaep. — These, Mr Thorne has been just as 

particular in selecting as he h.as his Short-horns. His flock 
 consists of the buck 112, which he obtained of Mr. Jonas 
 Webb, of Babraham for 130 guineas — $050; twenty choice 
 ewes, also of Mr. Webb, seven of which came out in lamb 
 to his buck which took the first prize at the Show of the 
 Royal Agricultur.al Society at Lewes. The rest took tbo 
 buck 112 after their arrival here. In addition to these,'be 
 purchased the ten ewes from Mr. Lugar, which took the 
 first prize at the Show of the same Society at Gloucester; 
 and five prize ewes from Lord AValsingham's flock. Sev- 
 eral of these were in lamb to Mr. Lugar's old prize buck, 
 which he (Mr. L.) has recently had the great misfortune of 
 losing. We cannot speak too highly of this buck, nor of 
 the ewes and their lambs. They remind us of Mr. Webb's 
 best breeders, and are richly worth the money that has 
 been paid for them. AVe would go into a particular des- 
 cription of the buck 112, and some of the ewes, if wo 
 thought it necessary to show their marked superiority over 
 ordinary South-downs. 

Long-wooled Sheep. — Mr. Thorne has a superior flock of 
 these, long, broad, round, fine and well woolod. To pro- 
 duce lambs for his own table, he has crossed a f^vr of his 
 Long-wooled ewes with-a South-down buck. This is a fa- 
 vorite cross in England for market lambs, and the mutton 
 is highly prized by amati'ors. 

Pigs. — Here we found (juite an assorfmen. Berkshires of 
 good size and high brcniing. These are the favorites with 
 us, and have boon since we first knew them, and that was 
 about twenty years ago. 

Next came the Suffcjlks, which we found a splendid lot. 
 The oldest boar from the celebrated stock of Earl Derby. 
 We should think he would weigh 400 lbs., and has had 
 nothing but grass all summer, which he has picked up 
 running in a narrow lane. He is now turned into an apple 
 orchard, where he gets a little fallen unripe fruit by way 
 of variety; and still he is apparently fatter than half tha. 
 hogs are in the country at killing time. So much for a 
 good breed . There are several others here of the same 
 kind, three of which are descendants of the imported stock 
 of Mr. Jackson, Astoria — finer than which never crossed the 
 Atlantic. 

Mr. Thorne also showed us some Mackay pigs, sent him 
 by Mr. Levi H Dowley, of Massachusett. They were got 
 by the boar of the late Hon. Daniel Webster, of 3Iarshfield. 
 One of these pigs closely resembled a fair Bufiblk. the other 
 is nearly the same shape as the Chinese pigs recently sent 
 us by Dr. Green, head surgeon of the Japan expebition. 

Madagascar Rabbit. — These are the property of young 
 Mr. Thorne, and were selected in England with the same 
 care as the other stock. The building for them is the neat- 
 est, best-ventilated, and best-arranged we have yet seen. 

One of these had pink eyes, and was a pure white color, 
 which is vey rare in this breed. 

Poiiltry. — Dorkings Game Fowls are the favorite breeds 
 here. These also belong to young Mr. T., who has been 
 quite successful with the latter. These he found to lay mor^ 
 steadily, especially during the coldest winter Aveather, than 
 even the Cochin-Chinas or Shanghais. They would lay 
 about thirty eggs, and then desire to sit, but upon being 
 broken up, they commenced laying again, and so continued 
 till they averaged fifty eggs each. By seperating the cock 
 from thepullets soon after they are weaned, he has not 
 been troubled by their fighting, which is the great objec- 
 tion to rearing Game Fowls. They .are often so pugna- 
 cious as to kill each other by the score. These were sent 
 him by Mr. James B. Clay, of Kentucky, ami are much like 
 the Earl Derby's breed, though some consider them supe- 
 rior. 

The Pigeons here are tumblers, of handsome cinnamon 
 and other colors. Very pretty of course. 

Farm Building. — These are among the most complete and 
 convenient we have yet seen. We particularly like the 
 arrangement of the cow stables. The stalls run the whole 
 length of the building on each side, with a wide paved pass- 
 age-way betwoon, of brick sot up on edge with cement. On 
 each side of this brick pavement is a shallow gutter to carry 
 off the liquid into cesspool From these, the liquid is pump- 
 ed into a cask on a cart, and then spread over the gra^s land. 
 It accelurates the growth of grass very much. The stables 
 are high between joints and well ventilated. Glass win- 
 dows are set on the south side for warmth in winter, and 
 small doors open to the north for summer, besides large 
 doors for the cattle at each end. One of these stables had 
 stalls for cowa on one side and for their calves on the other.
