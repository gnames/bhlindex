This adds to the convenience of sucking them. 

The Farm, though one of the best in Duchess county, Mr. 
 Thorne is still improving. Aside from grass and hay, his 
 crops are principally corn, oats, potatoes, sugar-beets and 
 ruta-bagas. The latter crop would do credit to old England. 

The Maiwioit is handsome, large and commodious. It is 
 surrounded by a wide lawn, dotted on each side by varied 
 mounds and beds of flowers and shrubery. On the front 
 sparkles the lake before spoken of, and the gurgling stream. 
 Trees intersperse the grounds, and a handsome carriage ro.ad 
 of the cleanest gravel forks wide from the center, in curved 
 lines to two entrance gates on opposite sides of the park, 
 opening to the main road. In the rear of the house are large 
 gardens and orchards, stocked with a great variety of vege- 
 tables and fruits of the choicest kinds. 

Such, in brief, is Thornedale, and its improved stock, 
 which it gives its liberal owner groat pleasure to show to 
 all who take an interest in such things. The number of 
 these, we are glad to say, are rapidly increasing throughout 
 our country. Would that every farmer appreciated these 
 improvements and profited by them according to his means. 
 How groatl}' would the comforts, the respectability, and the 
 happiness of the people be increased. How much more 
 highly would they stand in their own estimation, and that 
 of foreign nations, if all strove to do the best ihey could, 
 each in his own proper sphere. 

Hints on the Rearing and Management of Trees, 

Vast sums of money are annually spent in this country 
 on trees; it would be impossible to make a close estimate 
 of the amount, but we cannot be very far out of the way 
 in putting it at a million of dollars. Wo believe we could 
 show by figures that this is not, as it may appear to many, 
 an immoderate estimate; for more than one-quarter of that 
 amount may be sot down to Rochester alone. This gives 
 us some idea of the extent and importance of ourarbori cultural 
 interest, 3'et it attracts little attention. The men engaged 
 iu rearing planting trees are not those who make much 
 noise in the world. We have no arboricultural societies to 
 collect inf rmation or incite to experiment and observation 
 • — no public gardens or arboretums to test theories and 
 modes of culture — the whole matter thus far has been left 
 to individual effort and enterprise; and as both growers and 
 purchasers of trees usually proceed upon the principles of 
 economy, no groat improvement has been made upon old 
 methods; at least, this business has certainly not advanced 
 in the same ratio as some other branches of the useful arts 
 and science. How many of those engaged in the planting 
 and culture of trees, have taken pains to acquire the slight- 
 est possible degree of knowledge concerning their struc- 
 ture, the function of the different parts, and their relative 
 connection and influence upon each other? Not one in five 
 hundred. A man spending a hundred dollars for trees does 
 not consider it worth his while to consult the best books 
 that have been written on the subject — he does not con- 
 sider that a dollar spent in that way might save him fifty 
 in the management of his plantation. A low words of oral 
 instruction from some one perhaps as ill-informed as him- 
 self, or a few hints which he finds on the cover of a nursery- 
 man's catalogue, supply the needed information. We are 
 happy to admit exceptions — numerous too. Books and 
 papers are read and studied; but the few who read and sock 
 intorm.ition from such sources are, when compared with 
 the number of persons who pl.ant trees, but a drop in the 
 bucket. Frauds of all kinds are perpetrated upon people 
 thus exposed by ignorance; for there is no pursuit under the 
 sun exempt from dishonest tricky persons. It is not .sur- 
 prising that we hear, every year, people complain bitterly of 
 their trees. Some they lose totally the first season; others 
 linger along for years without m.aking any considerable 
 growth, while the cause remains a complete mystery. They 
 were nice trees, well planted and every way well cared for. 
 Now there are many reasons for these fiiilures; and if people 
 wore as well informed as they should be on this subject — 
 if they possessed a correct knowledge of the essential pro- 
 perties of a tree for safe and successful removal, and under- 
 stood properly what good planting and good treatment consist 
 in — they could readily account for their losses. 

We propose, now, to offer a few suggestions on these topics 
 — first, in regard to the qualities of trees, and how these 
 are to be secured; secondly, on planting and subsequent 
 treatment. Wo may as well say at the outset, that we are 
 not about to offer either a new theory or practice, but sim- 

ply to point out certain principles and details of culture 
 and management, well understood and universally approved 
 by oxporieuced, practical tree-growers. 

In the first place, a very large number of the trees sent 
 out from the nurseries are not fit to be planted. We must 
 not be understood now as alluding to any nurseries in par- 
 ticular. The fact of our being a nurseryman will not pre- 
 vent US from expressing our convictions freely; .and when 
 we charge malpraticc on the trabe, we-iire prepared to 
 shoulder our share of the blame. We intend our remarks to 
 be applied in a general way, however, and we believe all 
 candid nurserymen will admit the truth of what we are 
 about to say. 

It will be generally admitted that hardiness is one of the 
 most important qualities of a tree, to fit it for safe removal. 
 How is this to bo attained? It is very well known that 
 nearly all purchasers of trees perfer such as are tall and 
 straight vfith a smooth, glossy bark, indicating what is called 
 "thriftiness." Height is the greatest requisite — in fact, the 
 sine qua non — with by far the greater number of purchasers. 
 Now, nurserymen must consult the taste of their customers, 
 and they are compelled to adopt a system of culture that will 
 produce such trees as they find saleable. They must either 
 do this or abandon the trade. To produce these tall, smooth- 
 barked trees,, they must manure their ground highly and 
 plant closely. In these dense nursery plantations the light 
 is pretty effectually excluded from all parts of the tree save 
 the top; and as, according to an unalterable law of nature, 
 trees and plants grow towards the light, the tops push up- 
 wards and few or no side branches are formed. Those who 
 have not seen this exemplified in the nursery may have 
 seen it in the forest. If a number of Elms or Maples, for 
 instance, are planted closely iu a group, and others soperate- 
 ly, on the same sort of soil, wo find that those idanted close 
 together shoot upward rapidly, forming tall, smooth, naked 
 trunks, with a few branches only at the tup; while those 
 standing apart in the open space grow in height slowly, but 
 throw out numerous side branches, the trunk is thick, the 
 bark furrowed, and the trees are so different from t^e others 
 as to have scarcely a characteristic in common, save the 
 foliage. These tall trees, with branches grown in the shade 
 and shelter, have few roots. In a natural state the roots al- 
 ways boar a due proportion to the branches. We find that 
 a tree standing in an open field, and having a wide-spread 
 head, will have roots extending three or four times the dis- 
 tance of those of much more lofty trees do growing in a 
 thick grove or forest. It is on this account that trees loft 
 standing when the forests are cut down, seldom survive the 
 shock of the first gale; they are broken or torn up by the 
 roots. Nature beautifully adapts everything to its situation 
 and circumstances. The tree in the depth of the forest is 
 sheltered on all sides, and requires but few roots to resist 
 the force of the wind, or branches to protect its trunk. The 
 tree in the open field exposed on all sides, requires an am- 
 ple supply of both. It grows moderately, its trunk is stout; 
 its wood is firm, compact, and hardy; its bark is thick: its 
 roots numerous, wide-spread and powerful; its branches am- 
 ple, evenly disposed, and nicely balanced. There it stands, 
 fitted out completely to meet the requirements of its posi- 
 tion. 

There is valuable instruction here for us all. Nursery- 
 men know that when their rows of trees are thinned out — 
 say one-half or three fourths removed — the remainder, in- 
 stead of pushing upward, as they had done before, begins 
 to throw numerous branches, the trunk thickens, and the 
 roots spread and strengthen rapidly. One season's growth, 
 under such conditions, gives them such a hold of the 
 ground that it requires three or four times the amount labor 
 to remove them that it did the j'ear previous, when they 
 stood very close. On this account such trees, although gen- 
 erally regarded as culls, prove most successful when trans- 
 planted, and are preferred by experienced planters, even if 
 they be defective in form. 

Trees rapidly grown, forced with a rich soil, and drawn 
 up in the shade and shelter of close nursery rows are as ill- 
 fitted to stand tho shock of removal into the open ground, 
 exposed to the full force of the sun and wind, heat and cold, 
 as are tho tall and slender trees that have grown up in the 
 heart of tho forest. The young trees h.ave the advantage in 
 being more plastic; they suffer and almost die; but the in- 
 herent vigor of youth enables thorn iu many cases, to weath- 
 er tho storm. But even where they survive tho shock, it 
 is severely felt, and shows itself in the slow and feeble 
 growth which follows removal.
