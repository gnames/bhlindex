Potato Harvesters. 

Three patents for machines to dig potatoes have been gran- 
 ted. The first of these consists of an axle and a pair of 
 wheels, drawn by a pair of horses, and around said axle, 
 which moves with the wheels, a drum or cylinder is arranged, 
 and armed with rows of radial toeth, while immediately ^*^~ 
 hind and beneath, and in the same curve with the periphery 
 of the said radial teeth on said drum, is arranged a fixed r.ake 
 which has the ends of its curved teeth at the lowest part of 
 the machine, while its rear dartand head extend upward and 
 backward in the curve of the said drum to the highest part 
 of the machine. 

Operation. — As the machine is drawn forward astride the 
 row of potatoes to be dug, the rake teeth of the fixed 
 rake run into, or under, the hills of potatoes, while the ra- 
 dial teeth on the drum sweep backward along the potatoes 
 toward the curved teeth, and as the dirt falls out, the pota- 
 toes are carried rearward and upward between the drum 
 teeth and the curved rake head, and when at the top of the 
 drum they roll oS" into the cart body. A second machine 
 cxf this character has also been patented, substituting for the 
 radial toeth on the drum a series of stiff brushes, and for 
 tfie upper portion of the curved rake head, in the rear of the 
 drum, an endless beltof open work slats, or their equivalent, 
 for the purpose of allowing the dirt to fall out, and to carry 
 np the potatoes and deliver them into the cart bodv. — Cul-

The Use of Fruit. 

Instead of standing in any fear of agenerous consumption 
 of ripe fruits, we regard them as positively conducive to 
 health. The very maladies commonly assumed to have their 
 origin in a free use of apples, peaches, cherries, melons and 
 wild berries, have been quite as prevalent, if not equally de- 
 structive, in seasons of scarcity. There are so many erroneous 
 notions entertained of the bad effects of fruit, that it is quite 
 time a counteracting impression should be promulgated, hav- 
 ing its foundation in common sense, and based on the com- 
 mon observation of the intelligent. We have no patience in 
 leading the endless rules to be observed in this particular de- 
 partment of physical comfort. No one, we imagine, ever 
 lived longer, or freer from the paroxysms of disease, by dis. 
 '■erding the delicious fruits of the lands in which he finds a 
 home. On the contrary, they .are necessary to the preserva- 
 tion of health, and are therefore caused to make their appear- 
 ance at he very time when the condition of thebody, opera- 
 ted upon by deteriorating causes not always understood, re- 
 quires their grateful renovating influence. — Boston Med. anc

Germination of Cherry Stones. 

The stones should be washed from the cherries when the 
 latter are fully ripe, and as soon as the surface has dried in the 
 shade, mixed with more than their bulk of sand, and buried 
 in shallow pit in the earth, covered first with flat stones, and 
 then with a few inches of earth. Hero they may remain 
 through the winter; but the first moment that the frost dis- 
 appears from the ground the following spring, they are to bo 
 taken out and planted in drills. They maybe planted in 
 autumn; but the soil settling hard about them, is apt to pre- 
 Tent their growth, unless it is of the lightest character. 
 Freezing tends to remove the shell, and assists germination. 
 The Mazzard makes the hardiest stocks, but the improved 
 heart varieties succeed well in most cases. — Alb' Cult. 

Massachusetts Hops. 
 The Inspector of ILips in Boston, urges the hop growers of 
 Massachusetts to be more careful in growing, picking and 
 packing their hops. He says: To all interested in growing 
 and dealing in hops it is well known, that during the last seven 
 years, in point of reputation and character, Masssachusetts 
 hops have suffered very materially in comparison with New 
 York hops; have been in less dem.andand sold at a lower price. 
 This fact is attributable to a combination of causes, the most 
 prominent of which are the following, viz: — Permitting too 
 many male hops, per acre, and too early picking, before the 
 hop was ripe; from bad picking; from packing the hops in un- 
 suitable bagging. The most fatal error of Massachusetts hop 
 growers, has been picking too early, before the hops were ripe, 
 and hurrying them into bags too soon. Under this system 
 of management hops cannot be produced for the brewers in 
 a state of perfection. " 

London Currants. 
 A writer in the Horticulturist speaks of the fine currants of 
 the market gardens near London, which are grown in the 
 following manner: They are planted in rows twenty or thirty 
 feet apart, and three or four feet apart in the rows; the 
 ground which ia naturally good is highly manured, and 
 cropped between with vegetables. When the plants com- 
 mence bearing, they are pruned very hard; the greater part 
 of the young wood is thinned out, and what is allowed to re- 
 main is shortened back to three or four inches. By thia 
 means the trees are always kept short, never attaining a 
 greater height than two or three feet. These strong manured 
 and well-pruned trees produce magnificent fruit, and in great 
 abundance, well remunerating the market gardener for his 
 trouble. — The Practical Farmer. 

American Flour Abroad. 

We aresorrj' to be obliged to caution our American friends 
 .against continuing to send over flour to these kingdoms of in- 
 ferior quality to that indicated by the brand. AVe know not 
 where the fault lies, but certain we are that more than the 
 half of what is imported to these kingdoms under the brand 
 of No 1. superfine, is mere rubbish, and discreditable to the 
 character of the American millers. 

Previous to the introduction of "free trade," we recollect 
 that Ohio and Western Canal flour bore a very high character, 
 and justly so; but we have perceived since then a gradual de- 
 terioration in the qualitj', to such an extent latterly as to caJl 
 loudly for interference. An immense proportion of the flour 
 nowlying almost unsaleable in Liverdool is of this description, 
 and the continued loss to our merchants has been so great in 
 consequence, that the result will ultimately be a transference 
 of the flour trade to our continental neighbors. French flour 
 decidedly carries off the palm as to quality, and a good har- 
 vest or two would pLace that nation in such a position as to 
 supply us more roadilj', and on better terms, with a superior 
 article of flour. We would earnestly urge upon such of our 
 readers as may be interested in this mattei-, and particularly 
 would we address ourselves to our American readers, the vital 
 necessity for their adopting immediate steps to have either an 
 eflBcient and faithful class of " inspectors" appointed, or to do 
 away with the branding of the quality of the flour altogether, 
 and let the purchaser judge for himself. Let the miller's 
 name, and a particular initial to be adopted by each miller, be 
 branded on the barrels as a matter of course; and indeed, we 
 cannot see how the trade can be conducted properly or cred- 
 itably on any other system.— 7ic(/'asJ Mercantile Journal. 

Onions for Poultry. 

Scarcely too much can be said in praise of onions for fowls. 
 They seem to be a preventive juid remedy for various diseases 
 to which domestic poultry is liable. H.aving frequently test- 
 ed their excellencies we can speak understandingly. For 
 gapes inflamation of the throat, eyes, and head, onions are al- 
 most a specific. We would recommend giving fowls, and es- 
 pecially the young chicks, as many as they will eat, as often 
 as twice or three times a week. They should be finely chop- 
 ped. A small addition of corn meal is an improvement 

Allen's Hybrid. 

The horticultural friends of Mr. J. F. Allen, have been 
 for some years aware that he had been experimenting, to 
 produce a hybrid grape, possessing the requisites which no 
 one hitherto has combined, of sure and early ripening, rich 
 flavor, abundant crop, and freeilom from "foxiness," All 
 lovers of good fruit will be gratified to learn that his long 
 and patient efforts for this object have at length been crown- 
 ed with complete success. He has obtained a white grape, 
 of the full size of the Isabella, of a flavor unsurpassed by the 
 best hot-house gr.apes, totally free from the "foxy" taste and 
 smell, and which ripens securely by the middle of Septem- 
 ber. He has also a purple grape, possessing similar quali- 
 ties, but not quite so early. — Sulein Gazette.

A Substitute for Ringing Swine. 

Mr. Tubb, an English breeder of stock, has recommended a 
 mode of de.aling with these mischievous animals,which it ia 
 said may supersede the necessity of putting rings in their 
 noses. It consists in simply shaving off with a razor or sharp 
 knife the gristle on the top of the noses of young pigs. The 
 place soon heals over; and the pigs are thus rendered inca- 
 bable of rooting.
