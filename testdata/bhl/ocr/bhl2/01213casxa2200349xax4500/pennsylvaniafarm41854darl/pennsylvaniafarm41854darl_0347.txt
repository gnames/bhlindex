Eaising Fruit Trees. 

This is one of the most important of the farmer's duties, 
 nnd one in the execution of which he can rely but little on 
 the experience of the generations which, in this country, 
 have been before him. « 

As to the value 'of fruit trees, as a source of profitable in- 
 come, all doubt has long since vanit^hed. Fruit in great va- 
 rieties may bo profitably raised for home consumption, and 
 the market is always open and seldom refuses a paying profit. 
 A single orchard may fail — or a single variety of fruit — but 
 this luxury the people will have, cost what it may. Apples, 
 pear?, quinces, plums, gooseberries, j^eaches, blackberries, 
 cherrie=, grapes, and even walnuts, always find a market. 

We know that orchards deteriorate, but still apple trees 
 live quite as long as their owner. Fruits deteriorate. But 
 this jirocess is very slow, a,nd new varieties take the place 
 of those run out. The Newtown pippin has been a standard 
 fruit for one hundred and fifty years, and is now as good as 
 ever. The Baldwin apple has stood .among the first varieties 
 fc>r more than one hundred years. If wo are not mistaken, 
 some of the earlier trees of these kinds are stdl in bearing. 
 One pear-tree, at least, is known, which is over two hun- 
 dred years old — the Endicott pear-tree, in Massachusetts; 
 .nnd we are told by Mr. Proctor, that another, eighty years 
 old, has recently made twelve or eighteen inehue of wood in 
 a season. The golden pippin was commended as early as 
 1660, and has ever since retained its high rank. 

Surely this is suflacientlj' "permanent" for a geueration 
 found to extend only to thirty years. 

But beside well-known fniit.s, new varieties may be pro- 
 duced of equal value, and this department need be liniited 
 among scientific fruit-growers no more than the care of an 
 old orchard. Indeed, the latter needs more science than the 
 originating of new fruit. There is no magic known only to 
 n few. which will ever tend,ia these experiments, to insure 
 peculiar success. 

Plant your nurseries, grow your trees, and try your chance 
 among the rest. One new valuable fruit will pay for fifty 
 failures,— Pfoio, Loom & Anvil. 

Irish Potatoa Peelings. 

Some tune in March last, a negro boy of ours was sent 
 from the kitchen to the pig pen, to throw in some of the raw 
 peelings of the Irish potatoe. The boy picked out those 
 peeiinirs containing eyes, and planted them in a. fence corn- 
 er. When the frost cut ours down, the little nif/ger chuckled 
 at his later jnitch — frost never touch him. 

A few d.aj's since, we saw the little fellow staggering under 
 a load of something in a large basket on his head, he ap- 
 proached, showing a set of ivory, and with a knowing look. 
 Just look here, raassa Charles, see what i'se made froju dem 
 tatcr skins? beat your big taters all to smash. We looked in 
 the basket, and to our astonishment saw near a bushel of as 
 fine Irish potatoes as were ever raised in any country; they 
 were of uncommon size and as mealy as a boiled chesnut. 
 Master! says little wooly, ain't you going to put it in de 
 newspaper, hi)W little nigger make big taters from yieelings 
 iu de fence corner, and buut he old master wid all his gwan- 
 iierand gypsum? We promi ied to put it in the ''noose paper" 
 and hero it is. " ir/ir/e/'///,'.s'" may take a lesson from the 
 little negro's economy. There is many a fence corner that 
 might produce a good crop of Irish potatoes. — Soil of the

Comparative Weight of Sheep and their Fleeces. 

I like friend Batcbelnr's suggestion (if having the ratio 
 shown between the weight of sheep and their fleeces. As I 
 believe that (caeteris jiaribus) otiier things being equal, sheep 
 •IS well as other animals consuming food in proportion to 
 their weight, and hence those sheep are the best for wool 
 growing, which will shear the most and best wool in pro)ior- 
 tion to the weight of carcass, and in selecting a sheep to 
 breed from I always take that into consideration. 

At shearing time I weighed my ewes fleece, noting the 
 weight and numliering the ewes — the yearlings were not 
 numbered. I weighed two of the ewes a few dnj's since, 
 and found No. 1 weighed 77 lbs., the fleece 6 lbs. 6 m. — 
 equal to 1 lb. of wo.d to 12.08 lbs. weight of animal. No 2 
 wei^'hcd 62 Ibn., the fleece weighed a lbs. 6 oz. — e<|ual to 1 lb 
 of wo(d to Hi lbs. weight of the animal. The ewes each 
 raised a lamb. The wnol was washed on their backs, and 
 of one year's growth. The quality was very good, being a 
 croEb- of Saxony and Merino. 

I would have been glad if friend Batchelor had given us 
 the weight of his lambs, they must have been diminutive. 
 Who will forward the weight of some of their bucks and 
 their fleeces? I would remark that mere weighing will test 
 but little, unless the fleeces can be jilaced side \sy side to test 
 their quality and condition. — Ohio Farmer. 

Watering by Trenching and Draining. 

That watering is a very imijortant element in the economy 
 of vegetation, maj^ be readily conceived when it is known to 
 form upwards of one-half of all green vegetable matter, and 
 servos as a medium for the conveyance of all their food. 
 All mineral ingredients that enter into the system of plants, 
 must be in a state of solution, or so minutelj' divided as to 
 be carried along with water. Even the gaseous elements 
 that enter by the roots are introduced with water, since it 
 is supposed that they cannot enter into the ajriforra state. 

In cultivation of the soil, the most important inquiry is, 
 its relation to water. It is waste both of time and money to 
 attempt improvements on wet lands until they are drained. 
 I am aware that draining is not generally recognized as an 
 indispensable auxiliary to successful cultivation, but it is, ne- 
 vertheless, a fact that soils, even of a ilry nature, will sup- 
 port a more luxuriant vegetation after being undermined 
 with drains, than they did before. The reason is simply 
 this : All soils have their respective absorbing properties, 
 and if the surplus which is not retained liy absorption, is 
 not carried off by drains, it becomes injurious. Air is ad- 
 mitted, the soil is rendered more porous, water percolates 
 freely into it, the air holds moisture in suspension, aiul 
 when the surface supply fails, this suspended moisture is 
 again brought up by cajiillary attraction, a principle in cul- 
 tivation which is not generally known. 

But by far the best preventive of the evil effects of severe 
 drought, is deep cultivation. Loosen the soil, no matter how 
 deep, so that the best soil is kept on the surface, Treiieh- 
 iru/ is undoubtedly the most thorough juocess of deepening 
 soil. The advantages derived from it are various. The ab- 
 sorbing capabillities of the earth are increased, and .a large 
 supply of moisture is thus retained. The roots of plants 
 can extend into a medium where they are exempt from the 
 extremes of drought and heat, and obtain a more regular 
 supply of nourishment, being neither so.likelj' to sufler in 
 wet, or burned up in dry weather; as in the former ease the 
 surplus passes freely doAvn, and in the latter is drawn up by 
 capilliary attraction, more especialy where a judicious sys- 
 tem of surfiice stirring is preserved iu, preventing rapid sur- 
 face evaporation. 

In addition to the snppl.v of moisture thus secured, 
 trenching, when properly performed, transposes and disin- 
 tegrates the soil. The surface that has been exhausted by 
 continu.al cropping, is replaced by a jiortion of sub-soil, en- 
 riched with the nutritive matters that have naturally sunk 
 and been washed down with rains from the surface, and car- 
 ried beyond the reach of roots; the manures applied are 
 more freely incorporated with the soil, and their action lie- 
 comes more regular and uniform, and more directly availa- 
 ble for the purposes of vegetable growth. 

Artificial waterings are often misapplied; for instance, it 
 is no uncommon occurrence to see a small basin formed 
 nronnd the stem of a large tree, into which a few gallons of 
 water are poured daily. This is all but useless, since the 
 absorbing and feeding points of roots form a circle at a con- 
 siderable distance from the stem, consequently the water 
 cannot reach them. Newly ]danted trees' are also frequently 
 killed through kindness in this respect. A tree with muti- 
 lated roots and scanty growth of leaves, re(|uires very little 
 water. Mulching over the roots with a covering of tan bark, 
 manure, Ac, is much more expedient than a direct applica- 
 ti<m of water, which cools the soil and retards growth. 

Soil that is jiroperly a'rated, deejily trenched, and judi- 
 ciously manured, will supjiort a luxuriant growth, no matter 
 how long a dry spell we may have, more especially if the sur- 
 face is kept loose and open, to preveiit, in some degree, 
 evaporation of moisture, and radiation of heat.

Wild Oats. 

Wild outs — a crop that is usually sowr. between 18 and .32; 
 the harvest generally sets in about ton years after, and is com- 
 monly found to consibt of a broken constitution, two weak 
 legs, a bad cough, and a trunk filled with :inall vials and 
 medical preparntitns.
