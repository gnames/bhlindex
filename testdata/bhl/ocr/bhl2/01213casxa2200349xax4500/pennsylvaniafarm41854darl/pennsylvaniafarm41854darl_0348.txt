What our Country pays for Guano. 

The Genesee Farmer say.<: â€” The ((u;intity of guano which 
 will b<? brou^jht to tho United States this year will bo about 
 200,000 tons. 

Two hundred thousand tons of guano purchased at fifty- 
 five dollars a ton (the present price in Now York) will take 
 out of the country eleve.n million dollars for imported ma- 

nure. For a comparatively new country, this is a startling 
 fact. All tho corn and corn-meal exported in the last fiscal 
 year amounted to loss than two and a half million dollars. 
 When will our people see the folly of wasting so much of the 
 elements of crops in almost every rural district, and then 
 sending to tho west coast of South America, for ten million 
 dollars' worth of manure!" 


DTTRHAM 

The above is an engraving of a beautiful Short-Horn 
 heifer, Esterville, formerly the property of E. P. Pren- 
 tice, Mount Hope, near Albany. She contains in great 
 perfection most of the points for wliich Durhams are 
 so celebrated, and if tlie portrait is correct must have 
 been a model animal, though her appearance does not 
 indicate a very deep milker. This, in fact, cannot be 
 claimed for the pure Durhams as a breed, though there 
 are many exceptions, and it is chiefly on other accounts 
 they have attained their high reputation. 

Public opinion, when it is allowed full time, is seldom 
 wrong in settling down on the comparative value of any 
 breed of animals. The present high prices and great 
 demand for Durhams, greater than ever before, and after 
 so many years trial, prove conclusively that they have 
 not been over estimated. While those who have incurred 
 large outlays, in order to bring to this country the finest 
 specimens from abroad, have generally been or will be 
 well repaid, the whole counti-y has also been benefitted 
 to an incalculable amount. The supply of beef from 
 food consumed by the improvement of the breed, in the 
 great raising and fattening districts of the west, is at 
 least one-third more than formerly, and probably in some 
 cases doubled. 

For size, quality, early maturity, disposition to fatten 
 and docile tempers, the Durhams are yet unrivalled and 
 will doubtless long maintain their ascendancy. Where 
 care has been taken to select good milkers, and to breed 
 them to bulls whose dams have also been remarkable for 
 this property, it has been shown that it is possible also 

HEIFER. 

to combine this with their other excellencies. The most 
 remarkable butter cows on record have been the Short- 
 Horns, but being bred oi-iginally with the view to beef, 
 milk and butter were lost sight of by the Messrs. Col- 
 lings and other of the earlier breeders. It has latterly 
 attracted more attention, and many of the London dai- 
 ries now contain beautiful specimens of the pui-e breed. 
 If their milk is not so abundant it is generally richer in 
 quality, and the ease and rapidity with which they can 
 be fattened off makes them more profitable than any 
 other. 

Those who wish to purchase Durham stock should 
 visit the State Exhibitions of Pennsylvania, New York 
 or Ohio, where they will find opportunities of selection 
 and comparison much better than on the farm of any one 
 breeder. The best stock of the country may generally 
 be found at these shows. 

LICHTENTHALER'S CTJLTIVATOS. 

The annexed engraving is a side view of a Cultivator, 
 for which a patent was granted to Griffith Lichtenthaler, 
 of Limestoneville, Pa., on the 25th of July last. The 
 nature of the improvement in this cultivator consists in 
 the peculiar manner of attaching the shares to the 
 beams, whereby they (the shares) may be readily ad- 
 justed in position, and also allowed to yield to any ob- 
 structions with which they may come in contact. 

There are two beams, A, secured in an oblique posi- 
 tion by cross ties, B B, which are attached to uprights, 
 a, on the beams. The oblique position of the beams
