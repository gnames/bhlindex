gives tlie usual triangular or harrow-shape, the front 
 ends of the beams being nearer together than the back 
 ends. C are the handles or stilts attached to the cross 
 ties, and D is a reach secured to the cross ties, and hav- 
 ing a swivel tree, E, attached to its outer end. In the 
 under surface of each beam, A, there is a longitudinal 
 groove or recess, in which a metallic strip, F, is fitted, 
 and secured therein by wedges or keys, c, which pass 
 through projections, d. The projections pass upward 
 from the strips, F, through the beams. A, the wedges or 
 keys, being driven through eyes in the projections above 
 the beams. Each strip is perforated with holes, /, as 
 shown. The shares are represented by G. Each share 
 has a socket formed by two lips, g g. The sockets are 
 at the upper ends of the shares, and have holes through 
 them. The shares, G, are secured to the beams. A, by 
 placing the lips, g g, in the recesses, the strip, F, fitting 
 between the lips, and inserting a metal pivot or pin, i, 
 through the hindermost holes of the lips, and through a 
 corresponding hole, /, in the strip. Wooden pins, j, are 

passed through the fx'ont holes of the lips, and through 
 corresponding holes, /, in the sti-ips. The body of the 
 shares are set nearly at right angles with the beams, A 
 A, and the dirt is thrown by the shares, as the machine 
 is moved along, toward the center of the machine. In 
 case of the shares meeting with any obstruction, such as 
 a root, stump, stone, etc., the pins, /, being formed of 
 wood, will break, and the shares, G, will turn backward, 
 the metal pins, i, being the fulcrum or pivots (see dotted 
 lines, the pin of one share being broken), and the share 
 forced back. By this arrangement the machine is pre- 
 vented from being broken, or any of its parts wrenched 
 by sudden stoppages arising from obstructions. The 
 shares by means of the sockets at their upper ends, and 
 the perforated strips, F, may be readily adjusted to the 
 beams. Shares of different forms may also be applied 
 with the same facility, provided they have the sockets at 
 their upper ends.
