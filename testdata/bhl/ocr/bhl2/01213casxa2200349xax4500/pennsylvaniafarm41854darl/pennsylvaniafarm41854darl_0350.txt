The displaj' of Durham cattle was large and very good. 
 Among the largest contributors were Messrs. James Gowen, 
 of Mount Airy, Anthony Bolmar, of West Chester, and 
 Aaron Clement, Dennis Kelly, and Thomas P. Remington, 
 of Philadelphia; the herds of tho first named two gentle- 
 men were exceedingly fine. There were also many other 
 excellent specimens on the ground, and in view of the num- 
 ber and quality, the Committee feel as if full justice could 
 not bo done to the enterprise and liberality of gentlemen 
 who have given their attention and means to tho improve- 
 ment of this breed of stock, without the bestowal of some 
 special premiums. No such power being vested in this 
 Committee, it respectfully makes the suggestion to the E.\-
