part of the animals that came before our observation, and 
 particuhirly commend Mr. Morris Longstreth's bull "Ber- 
 ry." 

Although this is only the fourth exhibition of the Sociot}-, 
 we cannot lot the opportunity pass without assuring the 
 President, and all who take interest in the Society, that we 
 consider exhibitors have made unexampled improvement in 
 the <iattle sent for competition. 

Wo further beg leave to offer the following proposiiions 
 for the coni-ideration of the present and anj' future Presi- 
 dent and Committee of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural 
 Society, viz : 

1. That each separate and distinct breed of animals shall, 
 in future, bo so placed in the stalls as to follow each other. 

2. That each animal, intended for breeding from, shall 
 have a name, and the exact age stated in years, months, 
 weeks, and, in all very young ones, even days. 

3. That each exhibitor shall give his exact address. ' 
 Should those suggestions hereafter become rules, we wish 

and hope that those who intend to send cattle for corapeti 
 tion at future Fairs will bo particular in adhering strictly to 
 them; for, by so doing, they will greatly facilitate the com- 
 mittees in their decisions, and benefit themselves. Rob-
