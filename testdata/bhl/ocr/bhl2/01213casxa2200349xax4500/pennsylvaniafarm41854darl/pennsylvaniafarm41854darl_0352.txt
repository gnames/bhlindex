There were two or three other pairs of oxen entered for

 nor tested as to their working qualities. The Committee 
 cannot refrain from expressing their warmest admiration of 
 the animals exhibited, possessing, as they did, all properties 
 essential for the uses of the farmer. 

The Committee suggest to the Executive Committee the 
 propriety of awarding a discretionary premium of $8 to Geo. 
 Newton for a well bred and well broken pair of yearlings. 
 Also, a similiir mark of encouragement to Chauncey P. Hol- 
 eomb, of the state of Delaware, for a beautiful pair of two

 cannot but speak warmly of the high interest displayed by 
 the farmers of Chester county in this exhibition, and to au- 
 gur from the feelings displayed on this occasion, the hap- 
 piest results to the agriculture of our State and country.
