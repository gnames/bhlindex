No. 12i. — Matched Horses, Geldings, Single Mares, 
 Jacks and MuLE^s. 

To the President of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural 
 Society: — The undersigned, appointed to examine Matched 
 Horses, Geldings, Single Mares, Jacks and Mules, respect- 
 fully report that they have had great pleasure in discharg- 
 ing their several duties. 

The exhibition of horses in the class designated for your 
 committee's report has been large and attractive. Never, 
 herhaps, has there been such a splendid collection of horses 
 in Pennsylvania. Your committee expected the ajipeurance 
 of many specimens of the finest blood and action, but they 
 have been agreeably disappointed by the variety and general 
 excellence of the stock exhibited. 

Before awarding the premiums, your committee ask per- 
 mission to make a single remark. It is a fact that public 
 attention has been directed for years to the improvement of 
 the breed of cattle, hogs, sheep, and even chickens, while 
 the horse, the noblest animal in the service of maji, has 
 been comparatively neglected. True, there are many su- 
 perior horses in the State, and many have been presented 
 for exhibition, but they are exceptions to the general rule. 
 There is ample room for improvement in the introduction of 
 thorough-bred horses — the moderate use of them, the se- 
 lection of the finest mares for breeding, instead of those 
 broken down by age and labor. Such a course might be 
 more expensive, but the foals of such animals would com- 
 mand a full remuneration, and every one be benefitted by 
 the stylo, action, power and endurance of thorough bred horses. 

Your committee award the first premium of $30, for best 
 matched carriage horses, to Watson Newbold, of New Jer- 
 sey ; the second of $15, to John Emmett, of Philadelphia; 
 the third of $5, to Ilosea Ball, of Philadelphia ; and the first 
 premium of $20, for matched mares, to Wm. R. Brown, of 
 Bucks county. 

The matched horses of Mr. Newbold are well mated, and 
 remarkable for superior style and gentleness ; those of Mr. 
 Emmett for action and endurance ; and those of Mr. Ball as 
 good roadsters and elegantly trained. The mares of Mr. 
 Brown are distinguished for symmetry and bottom, also for 
 being admirably broken and fitted for service. A discre- 
 tionary premium of $5 is recommended for the Highland 
 ponies exhibited by Zephania Campbell, of Philadelphia. 
 For matched farm horses the first premium, of $30, is 
 awarded to Geo. W. Hocker, of Montgomery county ; the 
 second, of $15, to Hosea Ball, of Philadelphia ; the third, of 
 $5, to John Gillfillan, of Philadelphia : and a discretionary 
 premium of $10 to Henry S. Kupp, of Berks county, for the 
 best single draught gelding. The horses of Mr. Hocker ex- 
 hibit fine size and great muscular development ; those of 
 Mr. Ball for strength and kindness, and those of Mr. Gilfil- 
 lan are noted for general excellence as good farm horses. 
 The bay horse of Henry S. Kupp indicates great strength, 
 combined with light footedness; he is a superior specimen 
 of his kind. 

The first premium of $15, for farm mares, is awarded to 
 Eli Logan, of Chester county. 

The first premium of $10, for best gelding for saddle, is 
 awarded to F. A. Shower, of Philadelphia ; the second, of 
 $7, to Thomas Craig A Son, of Philadelphia. 

The Committee awarded to Charles T. Mathews, of the 
 city of Philadelphia, a diploma for the best "trained" sad- 
 dle horse of the "menage," of superior action, lightness.
