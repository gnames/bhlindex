To Hon. F. AVatts, President of the Pennnsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society:— The Committee on Imported Horses 
 award to Richard B. Jones, of Philadelphia, a diploma and 
 premium of $20, for his imported Stallion "Caliph." As 
 Mr. Jones did not exhibit an authenticated pedigree of "Ca- 
 liph," according to the regulations, he could not expect the 
 premium of a "thorough bred" — but the Committee have no 
 doubt, from tho appearance of the horse .and the statements 
 made, that he is of the Arab stock.
