Among the many and various pumps on exhibition, your 
 Committee were particularly interested in the great variety 
 exhibited by Corning & Co., of Seneca Falls, N. Y. ; among 
 which are the iron, brass, and side cistern pumps, especially 
 used and adapted to the farmer ; the out-door cistern and 
 well pumps, with the iron and side force pump.s, deserve 
 particular attention; the tight top well pump and brass force 
 pump for house are particularly commended ; the deep well, 
 railroad, double acting and iron house pumps have a value, 
 in the estimation of the Committee, which should commend 
 them to all persons requiring articles of the kind ; the gar- 
 den and fire engine pumps are more perfect than any other 
 the Committee have examined. For this collection the Com- 
 mittee award a silver medal. 

The Committee have examined the vtirious hydraulic rams 
 for raising water, and they are pleased to observe that there 
 is groat competition hero, as in other matters connected with

 Charles Keite, of Philadelphia, George Churnside, of Wil- 
 mington, Delaware, and .Tames llobb, of Huntingdon, Pa., 
 as exhibitors of agricultural implements, and award them 
 each $10. 

So many articles within their class have been exhibited, 

deserving of more careful attention than the Committee 
 have been able to give, that they can only suggest that 
 hereafter the division of committees may be more extended, 
 so that more perfect justice may be done to exhibitors. 

The Committee also, without intending to "travel from 
 the record of their duty," may be permitted to suggest that 
 permanency of place of the State Fair would, in their opin- 
 ion, render each succeeding exhibition more perfect in its 
 arrangements, and more generally useful and interesting.
