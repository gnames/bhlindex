No. 23. — Flour and Corn Meal. 

To lion. F. Watts, President of the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society : — Your Committee (No. 23) on Flour 
 and Corn Meal respectfully report, that they have examined 
 all the flour and other articles submitted to their judgment, 
 and beg leave to award as follows, viz: 

The first premium of $10 each on Flour is awarded to 
 two barrels — one from Ashland Mills, deposited by Smedley 
 & Rudolph, and the other from Lewistown Mills, John Ster- 
 rett & Co., deposited by L. G. Mytinger. Both barrels 
 made from white wheat, and very superior for family or ba- 
 kers' bread. 

The second and third premiums are awarded to Wm. B. 
 Thomas for his superior family Flour; the second of $5 for 
 his white Wheat Flour, and the third of $3 for his Red 
 Wheat Flour. 

There was a small sample of Ryo Flour exhibited bj' 
 Charles L. Wampole, but the quantity being too small to en- 
 able the Committee to form an opinion of the work pro- 
 duced, no premium is awarded to the depositor. 

To Patrick Queen, the Committee beg leave to recommend 
 a premium of $2 for his five bags Sea Island Hominy. This 
 article seems to be well prepared and neatly put up for fam- 
 ily use. 

Of Smut Machines and Grain Separators, there were sev- 
 eral varieties on exhibition. The Committee regret that 
 they had no means of testing the relative merits of these 
 machines. All of them seem to be well constructed, and in 
 their general principles calculated to produce the desired re- 
 sult. But without other personal knowledge, the Committee 

decline awarding any premium. The same remarks will ap- 
 ply to the Bran-Dusters exhibited. 

Of Mill Stones, some very fine looking specimens were on 
 the ground, and showed superior skill in their construction ; 
 but as to their good qualitj' in the grinding of wheat and 
 other grains, the Committee cannot pass judgment — practi- 
 cal experience alone being the true test of the quality of mill 

stones. Wm. M. Henderson, H. W. Snvdek, Caleb
