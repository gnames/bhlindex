No. 34. — Inventions. 

To Hon. F. Watts, President of the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society : — The Judges of articles enumerated 
 in invoice No. 34, entitled Inventions, report that they have 
 bestowed as much time as the brief continuance of the Ex- 
 hibition permitted to the examination of the specimens al- 
 lotted to them, some of which do not appear to come fairly 
 under the designation of inventions. This rem.ark applies 
 especially to the display of "hats, caps anci /«)•«," which ap- 
 pears to your Committee to be highlj' creditable ; but as they 
 have no practical knowledge of such matters, they must de- 
 cline making any reward other than a diploma to each of 
 the following exhibitors, viz: 

To Charles Oakford, for a most extensive and beautiful 
 assortment of Hats, Caps and Furs. 

To John S. Young, for a case of Hats and Caps of beauti- 
 ful finish, and to Messrs. T. A. Boyce and John C. Pfeil for a 
 similar display. 

Among the inventions that appear to be really such, the 
 Committee notice the following, viz: 

A Hydraulic Ram of large size for supplying Railro.ad De- 
 pots an I towns, deposited by Mr. .Joseph Strode, of West 
 Chester. It is deemed worthy of a discretionary premium 
 of $10, as being the most complete j^et produced. • 

They would also notice the Vibratory Engine of Garden- 
 er's improvement as deserving of a diploma. 

The premium of $3 for the best specimen of pressed Brick 
 is awarded to J. W. Andrews, of Norristown, for his speci- 
 men of brick burned with coal.
