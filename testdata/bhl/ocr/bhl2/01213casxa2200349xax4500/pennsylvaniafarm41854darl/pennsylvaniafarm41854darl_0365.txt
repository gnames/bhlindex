No. 36. 
 To Hon. F. AYatts, President of tho Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society : — The Special Committee respectfully 
 report, that owing to the great variety and number of arti- 
 cles submitted to their inspection, the merits of taany of 
 which could only bo decided by actual trial, precluded by 
 the cireumstiuces -under which n State Fair is held, they 
 have not felt at liberty to award premiums to a largo number 
 of probably deserving exhibitors. When a number of ex- 
 hibitors in tho same line presented ihoLr claims, they have 
 not pretended to decide upon their relative merits, inasmuch 
 as their opportunity for examination was inadequate to the 
 prop?^ (discharge of their duty. The following premiums 
 aro recommended :

 mens, illustrating the diseases of the Horse and other 
 domestic animals, deposited by the American Veteri-

Delaware County Agricultural Fair 
 The first annual fair of tho Delaware County Agricultural 
 and Horticultural Society wa.s held at Chester, on tho 15th, 
 16th and 17th days of SeptonAer. Tho display was credit- 
 able in the highest degree, A large number of superior 
 horses and neat cattle of the best breeds were on the ground. 
 Among the latter a pair of beautiful Durham cows, recently 
 imported by C. Fallon, attracted much attention. There 
 were also some fine hogs and sheep on the ground. Tho 
 Manufacturies and Machinists of Delaware county, were 
 well represented, while the djsplay of implements from tho 
 different agricultural warehouses of Messrs Landretli, Morris 
 & Co, Rogers and Pennodi Jt Co, were very imposing. Tho 
 floral and horticultural departments were good considering 
 the season, but what attracted most attention and seemed 
 most to embellish tho fair was tho array of innumerable 
 articles deposited by the ladies of Delaware county. 
 Wo subjoin a few of the principal first premiums : 
 Cattle .-—Geo. Drayton, farmer to Christopher Fallon, 1st 
 premium for imported Durham' cow "Rose," Devon Bull, 
 "AVm. Biglor," and Devon cow "Maid of Runnyracde;" AVm.
