Camden & Gloucester Agricultural Exhibition. 

The exhibition of the Camden & Gloucester Ag. vSoeiety, 
 vras held at "Woodbury, N. J., on the 19th of Sept.. The cattle 
 were geuerallj' natives and mixed bloods. There were some 
 fine Duvuns, but few Durhams. AVe are told that there has 
 been great improvement iu the stock iu these counties with- 
 in the last five years, and those on exhibition corroborate 
 this allegation. 

One of the best features iu this exhibition was the display 
 of superior vegetables — not great in quantity, but of the 
 highest excellence as to quality'. Some sweet potatoes — 27 
 of which were said to fill a''basket"(five half pocks) — were as 
 smooth as if passed from a turning lathe. The mammoth 
 watermelons were as good as they were great. Many other 
 articles deposited, particularly some of tlioso deposited by 
 the fair daughters of the Jersey farmers, attracted marked at- 
 tention, and hiid we space should receive marked notice. 

The awards of the committee were doubtless published, but 
 ■\>e have not been so fortunate as to receive a copy. 

Montgomery County Agricultural Exliibition. 

The icceut f;ui- of the Montgomery County Agricultural 
 Society was well attended, and exceeded in some respects, 
 any that have preceeded it. The display of horses and neat 
 cattle was very good, and clearly showed an increased deter- 
 mination of the Montgomery farmers to improve their stock 
 as fivst as practicable. We subjoin the following principal 
 first premiums : — Best stallion for draft, Elijah Lewis, for 
 '•Eclipse"; do do for farm and road, Charles Stout, for "Sir 
 Harry" ; do do for road, John Kline, for "Perfection."

 highly beneficiah 

Sctuylkill County Agricultural Fair. 
 This society hold its annual fair for 1854 at Orwigs- 
 burg, on the 17th, 18th and 19th daj-s of October. There 
 •were a number of valuable animals on- exhibition, but 
 generally of the more common kinds. Among the S'svinc 
 were four beautiful Suffolk pigs, belonging to our friend 
 J. S. Kellar, as fat and as lazy as an alderman. A few 
 feet farther along were two shoats, with long legs, long 
 sides, long noses, long and broad ears, thin shoulders, 
 and thin hams. Although labelled "seven months old," 
 they would not -weigh as much as a pair of Chester 
 county pigs at three. If premiums had been offered for 
 the fastest trotting hogs, or largest caters, this pair 
 •would certainly have taken" the prize. The poultry 

coops contained a number of fowls of the most popular 
 kinds, and demonstrated. that Schuylkill county had not 
 escaped the fever. The produce department contained 
 a number of superior samples of cereals and vegetables. 
 Most of the land in Schuylkill county, as our readers 
 know, is mountainous and unfitted for tillage; and much 
 of that under cultivation is farmed iu a very indifferent 
 manner, but there, as in other sections, the spirit of en- 
 terprise is at work.. More interest is taken in the im- 
 provement of the land than formerly, and large tracts, 
 Avhich a few years ago were waste lands, arc now produc- 
 ing respectable crops. The influence of the Scliuyl- 
 kill County Agricultural Society has ali-eady had a happy 
 effect, and with the stimulating prices of the Pottsville 
 market, is destined at no distant day to ciuadruple the 
 amount of produce now raised raised within its borders 

Fayette County Agricultural Society 

The third annual fair of this society was held at Browns- 
 ville on the 4th, 5th and Gth days of October. In many 
 respects the display was admirable 

Among many fine horses Mr. James Torrence's Morgan 
 horse from Alleghany county, attructed marked attention. 
 i\Ir, Fleniken also exhibited a noble horse from Greene 
 county. 

A number of very fine neat cattle and sheep were ex- 
 hibited. AVe quote some of the principal fiirst premiums.

The Floral and Ilorticult-aral departments v^cre not so 
 well supplic'l as they would have been had the season 
 been more favorable. The produce department was 
 well represented both in quality and quantity. 

^\inong other attraction to the Faj-ette county fair, 
 was. the contest for the premium for best laily rider and 
 and driver. The skill exhibited by ladies in the ring is 
 described by an eye witness as "very great." Miss Flan- 
 agan, of Greene county received the first premium for 
 the best riding, and Miss Grey, of Monongahcla city for, 
 the best driving. 

Mercer County Agricultural Fair. 
 A correspondent who long since promised fo give us an 
 account of the- annual fair of this society has not yet done 
 so, and our Mercer exchanges containing the premiums 
 never came to. hand. AVo onlj' know by a letter from a 
 frienil who mentions the fact incidentally, that it was, "con- 
 sidering the season, all that could be desired," that it "waa 
 manifest tlie farmers there were detorniined to keep pace 
 with their brethem elsewhere," and that "the determination 
 to raise and grow tho best, was becoming more and moro 
 general". AVill some friend in >[.,.,-..• ..,,,,..;,- ^.-n,} ,i^ a copy 
 of their proceedings?
