and when the storm is past, thoy resume their original 
 position. The speed of the wind wheel is never in- 
 creased by a powerful storm of wind, for it is as fully 
 under the control of the regulator as the Water Wlicel or 
 Steam Engine. The boxes in which the crank and pin 
 turn, are lined with Babit metal, and kept oiled by oil 
 cups, tubes and lamp wick drawing the oil on as needed. 
 If this Mill is well put up by competent workmen, it re- 
 quires no attention for weeks together. Oiling twice a 
 month is sufiBcient, if the right kind of oil is used. 

No new implements noticed in the public papers, has 
 been talked about by farmers in all parts of tlie country 
 as this Wind Mill. It has been chiefly used as yet 
 in pumping up water, but the patentee informs us, he is 

about adapting it to horizontal gearing, so as to be used 
 for threshing and grinding grain, cutting hay, cornfod- 
 der, and all other purposes for which steam or horse 
 power may be required. 

Of the economy of Wind power if it can bo made avail- 
 able, of course there can be but one opinion and as seve- 
 ral are about being constructed of Ilalliday'^ patent in 
 the vicinity of Philadelphia, we hope to be able to give 
 our readers, some practical information about their 
 working. They are made of six sizes, with wings from 8 
 to 20 feet in diameter, and at prices from $50 to $250 
 each.

J. W. FAWKES' PATENT LIME AND GUANO SPREADER. 

This machine has been recently brought before the 
 public, and has been received by many with favor. The 
 advantages which the patentee claims for it arc : 

1st. It spreads both wet and dry lime, compost, etc., 
 evenly and well, being entirely free from arching and 
 clogging on the rollers, and leaves the lime in a loose 
 and profitable condition. 

2d. It is an entire machine within itself; is calculated 
 for horses or oxen, can be hauled without waste of lime, 
 and is capable of spreading more lime in various condi- 
 tions, with the same number of hands, in the same given 
 length of time, than any machine now before the public, 
 as there is no one required in spreading damp or wet 
 lime to be on the machine to continue punching the lime 
 to keep it from arching, as my swinging division board, 
 running lengthwise of the hopper, overcomes this diffi- 
 culty. 

3d. There arc no cores admitted into the hopper but 
 what are completely pulverized, and pass through with 
 the lime ; thus overcoming the great difficulty of leaving 
 the cores lay in the hopper, which prevents the lime 
 from passing through regularly. 

tion of the heap ; and will spread as low as 15 bushels 
 to the acre, and can be regulated to any desii-ed quanti- 

New Articles at the Late Stata Fair. 

Among the many articles of great interest to the far- 
 mer and gardener exhibited at the late State Fair, we 
 have prepared a short description of those which h.ave 
 either not been before exhibited, or are but little kno^Ti 
 to Pennsylvania farmers. 

Kraiiscr's Patent Portable Cider and Wine Mill. â€” An 
 engraving of this was given in the .July number of the 
 .Journal. It received a silver medal over Hickok's and 
 all other cider mills, and is believed to be the best ma- 
 chine for the purpose now out. One of the pecuhar fea- 
 tures of this mill is the effective arrnngcments of the re- 
 ciprocating pistons, which, by their alternate action, will 
 cause a quantity of apples or grapes continually to ad- 
 vance with irresistible force against the passing tcctli of 
 the rapidly revolving cylinder, so that by the action of 
 the latter the whole fruit will be at once reduced to pulp 
 and discharged into the tub beneath the mill. The idea
