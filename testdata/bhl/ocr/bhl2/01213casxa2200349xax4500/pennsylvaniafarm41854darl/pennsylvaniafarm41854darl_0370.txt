THE FARM JOURXAL. 

[XovE5rBEr. 

leduced to pi-actice, is that of exactly imitatiug the ac-. 
 tioii of the human hand in holding an apple again'st the 
 teeth of a revolving cylinder until it is entirely reduced 
 to pulp. Its simplicity and power attracted great atten- 
 tion. 

Spain's rafcnt Atmo.tphcric Churns. — These were ex- 
 hibited of twelve different sizes, beautifully finished with 
 both brass and iron mountings, and attracted great at- 
 tention. The peculiar merit of this churn consists in 
 the constant admission of atmospheric air during the 
 churning process, and the opening for the escape of fe- 
 tid gas, which is always generated at such times, and in 
 oi'dinary churns is retained to the great disadvantage of 
 the butter and loss of labor. It is believed that more 
 and better butter can be made in Spain's churn, from a 
 given quantity of cream, and in a shorter time too, than 
 in any other churn now known. The dashers alsg are 
 moveable, and can be taken entirely out to render the 
 cleansing easier and more thorough. There is also a 
 wide opening for pouring in the cream. 

DickcT/'s Butter iloiild. — This is a small square form 
 of two sizes, for pound and half pound prints, and such 
 as are used in the extensive dairies of the Jlessrs. Dick- 
 eys of Chesten county. It is made to rest on a block, 
 the face of wnich has the impression or print to be 
 transferred to the butter. Into this form it is pressed, 
 after being weighed, by a small square wooden spatula, 
 made for the purpose. The doors of the butter form 
 are then opened by hinges, leaving the butter on the 
 print block, which is then turned up, leaving a good im- 
 pression on its face. The square form is also a great 
 improvement as regards convenience for packing for 
 market. 

Smith's Butter Worker. — Tliis appears to be a very 
 simple and effective article for the use of the dairyman. 
 It consists of a pan or box, beneath which is placed a 
 drawer for ice or cold water, the interior of which is the 
 cooling of the bottom of the pan or box, so as to put it 
 in fit conditiori for the reception of the butter to be 
 worked. The butter is then worked by means of a flu- 
 ted lever. This useful improvement is the invention of 
 Miss Lettie A. Smith, of Bucks county, and is well wor- 
 thy the attention of dairymen generally. 

Corn Shellers. — Amongst the many excellent corn 
 shellers, Davis' Patent Hand and Horse Sheller deserv- 
 edly attracted the attention of the farmers. We had not 
 sufficient time to examine this sheller minutely enough 
 to enable us to describe its peculiar arrangement. The 
 cobs are separated from the corn in the process of shell- 
 ing, which is a decided improvement upon most of the 
 common style of shellers. But its principal merit con- 
 sists in the perfect manner in which it shells the corn 
 from the cob. Although tested before the committee 
 with corn of the present season's growth, not a grain 
 was left upon the cob, nor could we observe a single 
 broken grain amongst the shelled corn. It was awarded 
 the first premium. 

Peckham's Cultivator, with reversable teeth, although 
 somewhat known, has not been extensively introduced. 
 It does not differ materially from other cultivators, ex- 
 cept in the teeth. These are formed of two pieces — a 
 plate of cast steel being bolted firmly to a heavy cast 
 iron shoulder or support. This steel plate is reversable. 

so that when one end is wora away, it raay be turned, 
 and the other end forms another tooth as complete as 
 new. 

Michif^an Sod and Subsoil Swivel Plough. — The in- 
 creased ■ attention which the merits of the Michigan 
 Double or Sod and Subsoil Plow has attracted, has call- 
 ed forth the inventive genius of our Yankee agricultural 
 brethren, and the result is a new double swivel plow, 
 which appears to be admirably adapted to the purposes 
 for which it is intended. The day has arrived when far- 
 mers are beginning to question the policy of the old sys- 
 tem of plowing by lands. The unsightly appefK-ance of 
 fields thus plowed, the absolute loss of ground and labor, 
 and the necessity of having the ground in a proper con- 
 dition for mowing and reaping machines, all cry loudly 
 for reform. This plow is one step in this desri-able di- 
 rection, and we shall be pleased to hear that upon trial 
 it will , serve the design of the ingenious inventor, Jlr. 
 Knox, of Boston. We cannot understand why some no- 
 tice of this new plow was not made by the conunittee 
 on plows. 

Deep Tiller Steel Phnrs. — These beautiful plows are 
 intended for working rich sticky soils. Being less po- 
 rous than cast iron, the steel mould boards and points 
 are susceptible of a higher polish, thus forming a \Aq\v 
 of decidedly lighter draught in adhesive soils than the 
 cast iron plow. They were beautifully finished, though 
 not any better than all plows of this kind turned out 
 from 'the establishment of the enterprising firm of Bug- 
 gies, Noui-se, Mason & Co. 

Allen's New Reaper and Mower. — This is a combined 
 machine, which has been practically tried during tlie 
 past season and with marked success. It has all the ap- 
 pearance of a machine calculated to do good work, and 
 we have no doubt that actual trial will prove that the 
 combined machine of Mr. Allen is equally as good as the 
 mower of his invention, so many of which were sold du- 
 ring the past season, and which, when properly made, 
 gave entire satisfaction. The price of this machine in 
 Philadelphia will be $135. It was awarded a silver 
 medal. 

The Pennsylvania Reaper and Raker. — This is another 
 new candidate for public favor in this section, although 
 a great favorite in some parts of the west. It is re- 
 markably simple in its construction, particularly the ra- 
 king apparatus, which is attached to one of the arms of 
 the reel. At first sight the practicability of raking off 
 well with so simple an arrangement would- be very apt 
 to be questioned, but we are assured on the best author- 
 ity that it performs admirably. The simplicity of this 
 machine is not confined to the raker. In other respects 
 it is equally simple and strong, and what is more, the 
 price at which it can be furnished will commend it to the 
 attention of the farming commimity. The price is $120. 
 It was awarded a premium of $10. 

IlallenhacK s Mower is a very simple macliine, in re- 
 gard to the merits of which there is a variety of opinions. 
 Its principal merits appear to consist in the fact that it 
 is operated by single cog gearing. We shall advise our 
 readers of its merits more fully when we have had an 
 opportunity of seeing it at work in the field. 

Urmcy's Reaper and Mower, for which a prendum of 
 $20 was awarded by the committee, may have merits of
