a liigh order, but from a pretty csircful inspection of its 
 parts, yre were not led to think very highly of it, nor 
 have we been able to learn that it has ever been success- 
 fully tested iu the field. 

IlufjetCs Reaper and Moiver. — This machine differs ma- 
 terially from any one exhibited in the peculiar construc- 
 tion of the cutting apparatus. It has a double set of 
 knives, whicli operate upon the principle of a pair of 
 shears. It is said to be a most excellent machine. Sev- 
 eral practical judges have informed us that during the 
 past season its success has been very marked. A pi-e- 
 mium awarded. 

IIussci/'s and McCorjyiick's Reapers were on the ground, 
 but as these veterans are sufficiently well known to re- 
 quire no further notice, we pass on to 

Mannimfs Xorth Ameiieoa Reaper and Mower, a ma- 
 chine which attracted as much attention as any other on 
 the ground. AVhether this marked notice is to be attri- 
 buted to its merits, or to the novelty of its construction, 
 we cannot say. The knives liave a rotary motion, and 
 are operated by small cog wheels and rope puUies. 
 The horse walks behind the knives, pushing the machine 
 before him. AVe are not disposed to think the pi-inciple 
 susceptible of practical application, the rotary motion in 
 mowing machine knives having long since been laid aside 
 as worthless. 

Moss" Calf Suckler. — "ffe were much pleased with this 
 article, and think it will be highly useful. It is merely 
 a tin vessel, holding perhaps five or sis quarts of milk, 
 at the bottom of which is attached an exact counterpart 
 of a cow's bag and teat of Indian rubber. We tried it 
 witli the pressure of the hand, as in milking, and were 
 surprised at the exact imitation of the milking process, 
 which the inventor has succeeded in making. All that 
 is necessary in raising a calf is merely to hang it on a 
 hook iu the stable or barnyard, fill it with the milk, or 
 hay tea, &c., and let the calf go to it at pleasure. It 
 will soon become accustomed to it, thus saving all trou- 
 ble. The manner also of feeding by suction is more 
 natural to the calf than drinking, and is more beneficial; 
 The price of this useful little article is only about 
 $2 25. 

We will continue further notices of new articles next 
 month. 

Book Notices. 

Cowperthwaite, Desllver & Butler, of Philadelphia, 
 have lately issued from their press a new work for far- 
 mers, entitled "The American Farmers' New and Uni- 
 versal Hand Book, or an improved and complete guide 
 to the treatment of soils, the operations of productive 
 field husbandry-, kitchen gardening, dairy practice, fruit 
 growing, management and diseases of animals, fowls and 
 bees, culture of flowers, ornamental trees, &c., construc- 
 tion of farm buildings, grafting, budding, pruning, 
 training, the great diseases of trees and plants, insects 
 injurious to animals, fruit trees, grain, &c." 

It is illustrated by over three hundred handsome en- 
 gravings. We have looked over the work, and find it 
 embodies a vast amount of information, much more on 
 all these different subjects, and in more detail, than we 
 had supposed practicable within the limits of a single 
 volume. It is what it professes, "a plain, practical and 

comprehensive detail of agricultural economy, in all its 
 departments, throughout the United States and Canada," 
 and as such worthy of a place on every farmers' shelf, 
 as a book of reference on every thing within the scope 
 of his business. Price $1 50. 

Talpa, or Chronicles of a Clay Farm, to which are 
 added prize essays on Tile Draining. 

This work is introduced to the public with notes by 
 Lewis F. Allen, and is intended to convey to the Ameri- 
 ! can farmer an idea of the process, and how by a com- 
 paratively small outlay, sviramps and bog land may be 
 turned into productive fields. In England and Scotland 
 I this has been carried on on a systematic scale, by whicli 
 : products have at least been qu!),drupled, and lands com- 
 I paratively worthless been made to equal in value the 
 very best. Originally written for England, the Ameri- 
 can editor, Lewis F. Allen, has added notes and remarks 
 which he thinks have adapted it to the '•inquiring mind 
 of the American.'' 

North American Pomological Congress. 
 The proceedings of this body in their fourth biennial 
 convention at Boston are crowded out this month by the 
 reports of our State and County Fairs They shall ap- 
 pear in our next. 

To Corresponcents and Others. 

Owing to the official reports of the Committees of the 
 Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society's Fair, we have 
 been compelled to postpone the publication of several 
 articles prepared for the present number, among which 
 are notices of several County Society's Fairs, a valuable 
 letter from our European correspondent, other communi- 
 cations, &c. We have also been compelled to omit seve- 
 vsX illustrations intended for this number.

Berks County Agricultural Exhibition. 

The third annual exhibition of the Berks County Ag- 
 ricultural Society was held at Reading on the 4th, 5tli 
 and 6th of October. The fair grounds are immediately 
 east of the city on the base of Penn's Blount, sufficient- 
 ly elevated to command a beautiful panoramic view of 
 the valley between the South and Blue mountains, some 
 twenty-five miles in width, and for a considerable dis- 
 tance east and west. The buildings, like those of the 
 Lehigh County Society, are permanent, and such as to 
 aiford ample protection to articles, stock, &c., placed on 
 exhibition. 

The display in general was excellent, and in tiic fruit 
 department remarkably fine; such, indeed, as would 
 have done honor to any Society in a far more favorable 
 fruit year tlian the present, and exceeded, both in quan- 
 tity and quality, that recently exhibited at the State 
 Fair. The produce, floral, ladies', artists', and mechan- 
 ical departments, were all well represented, and evinced 
 much skill and taste in the exhibitors. A beautiful centre 
 table top of Berks county, or all sorts marble, highly 
 polished, received much commendation, but we regret 
 to observe it did not receive the notice of a committee. 
 This slab will compare favorably with the richest foreign 
 marble employed for the same purpose. 

A number of very fine horses were exhibited, but 
 those that attracted most attention were "Lady .Jane," a
