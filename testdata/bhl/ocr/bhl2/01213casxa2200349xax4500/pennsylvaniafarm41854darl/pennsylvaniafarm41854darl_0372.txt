THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[November 

young Morgan mare, owned by John H. Keim, which 
 proved on trial to be the fleetest animal on the ground ; 
 "Joe Jewel," owned by "\Vm. L. De Borbon, and a grey 
 family horse owned by Reuben E. Adams. 

John A. Sheets exhibited a beautiful Durham Bull, 3|- 
 years old, which was considered by good judges to be 
 amongthe best of his class at the State Fair; John H. 
 Keim, £is Durham Bull, 2h years old (this is a superior 
 animal) ; D. Althouse and Joseph Wright, superior Dev- 
 on Bulls ; George M. Keim, an Alderney bull calf ten 
 months old; and Joseph Hemig and Theodore Wiley, 
 Native Bulls between one and two years old. Geo. M. 
 Keim also exhibited some fine Alderney cows. Most of 
 <lie cows marked Devon and Durham bore traces of oth- 
 er blood. 

The swine were generally labeled "Chester and Berk- 
 shire," and while many of them were superior animals, 
 they were coarser than the best samples of either of 
 these breeds. 

Our Berks county friends can certainly flatter them- 
 selves on the success of their Society. 

WasMngton County Agricultural Exhibition. 

The anuual exhibition of the Washington County Ag- 
 ricultxiral Society was held in the town of Washington 
 on the 20th and 21st days of September. The display, 
 we are informed, was not so extensive as on some for- 
 mer years, but nevertheless highly creditable. 

The first premium for the best "blooded horse" was 
 awarded to Hayes & Morgan ; best draught do., Robert 
 Harper ; best Durham bull, Philo Paul ; best Durham 
 cow, Robert England ; best Devon bull, T. C. McKeever; 
 best Devon cow, do. do.; best Grade cow, Jacob Morgan; 
 best French Merino buck, Hugh W. Williamsoh ; best 
 French yearling do., Thomas Vance ; best French ewes, 
 Hugh W. Wilson; best French lambs, do. do.; best Me- 
 rino buck, H. H. Clark ; best do. ewes, Jas. G. Strean. 
 But a small number of swine were exhibited, and of 
 only medium quality. The produce and manufacturing 
 departments were well represented, particularly those 
 depending on the industry of the ladies 

TJnion County Agricultural Exhibition. 

The second annual Fair of the Union County Agricul- 
 tural Society was held at Lewisburg, on the 5th and 6tli 
 of October. Owing to some feeling as to place of exhi- 
 bition, a considerable portion of the county was unrepre- 
 sented among the contributions, yet notwithstanding this 
 it was highly creditable, and; would have graced an older 
 society. 

From the stock of horses on exhibition — some of which 
 were verj' fine — -it is evident our Union county friends 
 have given more attention to this animal than to neat 
 cattle and swine. They are now awake to the impor- 
 tance of improvement in all branches of stock growing; 
 and with the influence of the society and of the Farm 
 Journal to stimulate exertion, we trust many years will 
 not elapse before the Union county farmers ^vill general- 
 ly secure the most profitable breeds. Among the premi- 
 ums awarded, we notice one to our friend Jacob Gundy 
 for the best bull, also for the best cow — the latter making 
 13J- lbs of butter per week. 

The display of fruit was particularly fine, so fine indeed 

that one might suppose Union had escaped the frost and 
 storm that left most parts of the state minus their usual 
 crop. The produce department was well supplied, 
 and the articles on exhibition generally of a superier 
 quality. We trust that by another year our friends in 
 Union will "pull together," and that the pride of place 
 will induce them to enter the lists to a man to contest the 
 prize of usefulness and excellence with other and older 
 societies. 

Mount Pleasant Fair. 

A spirited Agricultural Exhibition was held at Mount 
 Pleasant, Westmoreland County on the Sd and 4th ult. 

A large number of neat cattle, sheep, hogs, &c &c to- 
 gether with Agricultural and Horticultural productions, 
 implements, domestic manufactures, were exhibited. 
 John Thomas, and James Torrence, took the premiums 
 for best horses; W. Reynolds, best Durham cow and 
 John Gifi"en for best Durham heifer; S. Neel, for best 
 French Merino buck; W. Reynolds for best Southdown 
 do. 

Best wheat, Cherry & Voigt; best MeditciTanean 
 wheat, Samuel Warden ; beat corn, S. M. Obcrholt 

Monongahela Valley Agricultural Fair. 

The second annual exhibition of the Monongahela Val- 
 ley Agricultural Society was held in Monongahela city 
 on the 28th 29th days of September. All accounts which 
 have reached us speak of it in the highest terms. 

The features, common in some portions of the west, of 
 ladies competing for the premiums awarded to the best 
 riders and drivers, drew many spectators to tl,ie ring, who 
 were highly deliglitcd at the display of horsemanship, if 
 we may use the term, by several lady contestants. Our 
 friend Hazzard of the Monongahela Republican, speaking 
 of the performance of one lady says "it was skilfull, 
 tasteful, fearful. The concourse of people were almost 
 breathless as she shot around the ring with her iron 
 nerved horse. There was a wildness, a recklessness, a 
 skillfullness, in her riding that bafiies all description." 

Among the horses exhibited were two ilorgans, one 
 belonging to James Torrence, of Alleghany, and the 
 other was from Brownsville, Fayette co., but the name of 
 the owner we have not learned. The first premiuni was 
 awarded to "English Archy," a very fine horse belonging 
 to Gilmore & Co, Fayette co. There were no less than 
 forty premiums awarded for various classes and varieties 
 of horses. 

W. Halman received the fii-st premium for a Durliam 
 bull, and also for the best Durham cow; D. Rail for best 
 French Merino buck; J. M, Gallaher, best French Merino 
 lambs; J. Harper best Merino lambs; do do ewes. 

There were a large number of premiums awarded, on 
 all the articles usually competed for at Agricultural fairs. 

From the energy with which we happen to know the 
 afl'airs of this society are conducted, we auger the happi- 
 est results.

Fine Sv/eet Potatoes. 
 Our friend Caleb Strode recently presented us, or 
 rather one of us, with some sweet potatoes of his own 
 raising, which proved upon "eating" to be fully equal to 
 the best brought from Jersey. They were Luge, smooth, 
 and had a most delicious flavor.
