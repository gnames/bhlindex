VOLUME 4. 

WEST CHESTER, DECEMBER, 1854. 

NUMBER 12. 

To Our Friends. 

This number closes the fourth volume of the Farm 
 Journal — the most successful, and Ave think the best 
 that hns yet appeared. In taking a careful retrospective 
 view of this volume, we are happy to be able to say, that 
 we believe we have fulfilled every stipulation and promise 
 made in our prospectus, and that it has met our expec- 
 tations with a single exception — our subscription list has 
 not reached the point we had supposed it would ere this 
 have done, and which we still hope it will attain on the 
 opening of the next volume. Although the number of 
 our subscribers is not so large as we could wish, and as 
 we triist it shortly will be, we still have great reason to 
 be thankful to our friends in different parts of the State, 
 many of whom have placed us under lasting obligations by 
 their kind efforts and substantial patronage. We are 
 conscious that the only return we can ever make to most 
 of these, is to endeavor to merit their good offices by ren- 
 dering the Journal all they could desire it to be ; and this 
 we are determined to do. We shall leave no stone un- 
 turned — no labor unperformed, calculated to advance the 
 interest, or promote the prosperity of our patrons. We 
 shall hesitate at no expense, which circumstances will 
 warrant us in incurring, necessary to enhanse the usefuU- 
 ness of the Farm Journal, or to render it the very best 
 publication of its class, in the United States. As an in- 
 dex to the future, we beg to point to the numbers for 
 the year now closing. 

The next volume of the Farm Journal, if we are not 
 greatly mistaken, will commence imder far better auspi- 
 ces than any which preceded it. Circumstances having 
 a tendency to impair the usefulness of the Journal, in its 
 earlj' stages, now no longer exist ; it has worked its way 
 to the homes and hearts of the leading farmers in this 
 and adjoining states; and it is rapidly becoming the vade 
 mecum of every intelligent agriculturist from the Hudson 
 to the Potomac. It is no longer a weakly plant strugg- 
 ling for subsistance amid weeds of older growth. Indi- 
 ginous to the soil whcron it is produced, it has taken a 
 firm hold, and is rapidly replacing others, tolerated only 
 In the absence of something bettci\ It may even now 
 boast an acquaintance with nearly every post office in 
 Pennsylvania and Delaware; and a little exertion by our 
 friends would enable us to send five and ten copies to 
 hundreds of offices, where we now send but one or two. 

We hope to double our present circulation within the 
 next three months. Should we be able to do this, our 
 means for still further improving the Journal will be 
 proportionly increased. May we not, therefore, ask our 

friends, one and all, to speak a good word for us to such 

as are unacquainted with the Journal; — to forward ua 
 their own and their neighbors names for the coming vol- 
 ume? We respectfully ask each of our subscribers to 
 consider himself an agent, and to use his influence to ob- 
 tain a small club of subscribers. We have made the 
 most ample arrangements for booking names and mail- 
 ing Journals hereafter, so that, though they should pour 
 in upon us at the rate of a thousand a day, we are pre- 
 pared to return receipts and send out the number by re- 
 turn mail. 

It may be proper for us to say here, that the cash sys- 
 tem having met the approbation of our friends almost 
 unanimously, and having found it far preferable in every 
 respect to the plan of sending the Journal out on credit, 
 we shall strictly adhere to it. Our friends can rest as- 
 sured the Journal will not be sent to subscribers after 
 the expiration of the period paid for, unless it be a com- 
 plimentary copy for which no charge is ever made. Ev- 
 ery subscriber knows the time his subscrption will expire, 
 and in giving his name for one volume, he can rest sat- 
 isfied that he will have no trouble in having it discontin- 
 ued at the end of time paid for, as that will, follow as a 
 matter of course, unless he shall renew his subscription. 
 We have had enough of the credit system to last an ordi- 
 nary life time, and if we shall be able to collect the 
 amounts remaining due for volumes 1, 2, and 3, (publish- 
 ed, unfortunately, on the ci'edit system,) without being 
 compelled to institute procedings, or to expose the names 
 of some persons who were willing to read these volumes 
 of the Journal, but seem unwilling to pay for them, we 
 shall be content. 

Again we say to our friends give us a helping hand, 
 send us on your own and your neighbor's subscription for 
 the next volume, and rest assured, you will receive our 
 lasting gratitude for your kindness. 

Cold Oraperies. 
 One of the most valuable appendages to a country res- 
 idence, and which yields a speedy and most luxurious 
 return for the outlay, is a cold grapery. This is simply 
 a frame building, with either a span or lean-to glass roof, 
 for the cultivation, without heat, of such varieties of 
 grapes as are not perfectly hardy out of doors. The con- 
 struction is very simple, being for a lean-to house merely 
 a double frame, two feet in front and twelve feet high at 
 back, nailed to substantial posts set in the ground from 
 three to three and a half feet, with the intervening space 
 filled with tan closely rammed down. The width should
