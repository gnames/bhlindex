be sixteen feet, admitting of two lengths of siisb. Such 
 a house is estimated to cost not more than $8 per run- 
 ning foot. 

It may not be generally remembered that most of the 
 splendid bunche:?, which gi-ace the ftiU exhibitions of our 
 Horticultural Societies, particularly in the cities, are 
 grown with trifling expense in houses of this description. 
 At the late State Fair, bunches were exhibited by David 
 S. Brown, from his graperies in Delaware County, four of 
 which weighed 25 lbs. 2 oz. One bunch with every 
 grape perfect and large, T.'cighed 6 lbs. 12 oz. II. U. S. 
 Cleavland, Burlington N. J. for several years successively 
 carried ofiF the premiums of the Phiadelphia Horticultu- 
 ral Society, for his fine black Hamburg grapes also grown 
 in a house without heat. Indeed, we are satisfied, inde- 
 pendent of the luxury of such a dessert for one's own 
 table, they may be made a source of great profit. Mr. 
 Cleaveland's grapery, which we have visited, was a very 
 simple afl"air, formerly used for propagating IMulticaulus, 
 but he had a fine, deeply dug, well prepared border out- 
 side, twenty feet wide. His grapes were always sold 
 beforehand to one establishment in Chesnut street, Phil- 
 adelphia, at fully remunerating prices and the demand 
 was always greater than the supply. It is a matter of 
 some accoimt at least, for a farmer to save ti?ne in his 
 marketing. A crop he has merely to deliver at one place 
 and receive his pay, without waiting for customers, in 
 a market house exposed often to inclement weather, has 
 certainly one great recommendation over ordinary and 
 more bulky farm produce. A cold grapery 100 feet 
 long, at $8 per foot, would cost $800, the interest of 
 which is $48. We believe a net interest of twenty per 
 eent would be obtainded by erecting a cold grapery, in- 
 stead of putting the money out on mortgage, as our 
 farmers generally do with their surplus cash at the end 
 of the year. The attention required would be but very 
 slight, and such as could readily be perfomed by the 
 females of the family. 

So accustomed are we to an unvarying rotation of 
 com, oats, wheat, potatoes, that we have but little ex- 
 pectation our hints will be acted on to much extent by 
 our agricultural friends; still we do not fear, to recom- 
 mend, to hundreds, of our readers in the country to build 
 a cold grapery both as a source of pleasure and profit. 
 We have made the suggestion, and we hope at least they 
 ■will think of it, and reflect upon it. The varieties we re- 
 commend for this purpose are black Hamburg, white and 
 grizzly Frontignan, and golden Chasselas; but the black 
 Hambui'g most especially. As regards the routine of 
 oolture Downing says : 

"In a vinery without heat this is comparatively simple. 
 As soon as the vines commence swelling their buds in the 
 spring, they should be carefully washed with mild soap 
 suds, to free them from any insects, soften the wood and 
 assist the buds to swell regularly. At least three or 
 four times every week they should be well syringed with 
 water, which, when the weather is cool should always 
 be done in the morning. And every day the vine border 
 should be duly supplied with water. During the time 
 when the vines are in blossom, and while the fruit is set- 
 ting, all sprinkling or syringing over the leaves must be 
 suspended, and the house should be kept a little more 
 closed and warm than usual, and should any indications 

of mildew appear on any of the branches it may at once 
 be checked by dusting them with flower of sulphur. Air 
 must be given liberally every day when the temperature 
 rises in the house, begining by sliding down the top 
 sashes a little in the morning, more at mid-day, and 
 then gradually closing them in the same manner. To 
 guard against the sudden changes of temperature out of 
 doors, and at the same time to, keep up as moist and 
 warm a state of the atmosphere within the vinery as is 
 consistent with pretty free admission of the air during 
 sun shine, is the great object of culture in a vinery of 
 this kind." •

Paienl Angular Ilames. — These really beautiful and 
 ingeniously constructed hames were awarded a diploma. 
 They arc made upon strictly scientific principles, and it 
 is claimed by the inventor that the angles upon Vi'hich 
 the patent was obtained are so constructed as to throw 
 the draught entirely upon the muscles of the horse's 
 shoulder, where a wise creator has placed his greatest 
 strength. There are fourteen diiiercnt sizes ranging 
 from the heavy Pennsylvania team hame to the lightest 
 required for gig or carriage purposes. Finished in a 
 very superior manner, light, neat and durable, their in- 
 troduction to general use appears to be a necessary con- 
 sequence. 

Rochester Hay, Straw and Fodder Cutter. — The crowds 
 which surrounded the operator of this machine during 
 the continuance of the fair evinced the interest and 
 pleastire taken with its performances. It cuts hay, 
 straw or fodder equally well, and with great rapidity, 
 having a heavy fly wheel and three sets of cogs. It is a 
 self-feeder by means of a cast iron rollei-, and the prin- 
 ciple of cutting is that of a pair of shears, the knife on 
 the cylinder, set at a given angle, coming in contact with 
 a bed plate. The exhibitor received orders for a large 
 numbei', which have since been delivered, and we under- 
 stand given satisfaction. They appear to be well and 
 strongly made. Price $15. 

DanieVs Hay, Straw and Fodder Cutter. — To our mind 
 this appears to be the ne plus ultra of cutters, combi- 
 ning as it does the qualities of an excellent cutter for 
 either hay, straw or fodder, in a greater degree, as it 
 struck us, than any one on the ground. Simj^le in prin- 
 ciple, constructed in the most durable manner, easily 
 kept in order, and not high in price, considering the 
 amount of work it will perform, we think it can be re- 
 commended with confidence. A year or two since, Dan- 
 iel's cutter was brought into some disrepute by some 
 sent into market from a manufacturer in New York very 
 imperfectly made, and indeed almost worthless — a cir- 
 cumstance not very unusual with implements from that 
 section, and which prevents many from being sold. We 
 understand, however, that now the proprietor himself is 
 the sole manufacturer. The price is $25 for such as are 
 adapted for hand or hoi-se power, and $50 for the largest 
 power machine. 

Wkittemore's Uncle Sam Vegetable Cutter. — This imple- 
 ment is simple and might be made to answer a good pui"- 
 pose at a cheap rate, but the manufacturers must im- 
 prove vastly in the quality of their work before they
