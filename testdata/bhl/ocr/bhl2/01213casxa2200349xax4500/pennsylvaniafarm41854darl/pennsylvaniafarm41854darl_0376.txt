This picture, Mr. Editor, will stand for a vast major- 
 ity of the farmers in this State, excepting only the "pro- 
 fessed piety" of the original. Its chief defects are in 
 the faintness with which the lines are drawn; and as 
 the attribute of "mercy" has not heretofore, and proba- 
 bly will not hereafter, be enabled to produce a reform, I 
 propose, with your permission, to consider in your next 
 number the absolute loss my neighbor suflFers from his 
 failure to keep an eye to the comfort and health of his 
 stock. Should I be able to state the facts as they exist, 
 Mr. A. may perhaps be induced to add mercy to his oth- 
 er virtues. P- 

A Word to Supervisors. 

Mr. Dabington : — In this section of the country it is 
 customary to have a general road mending in the spring 
 immediately after corn planting. The ditches are then 
 opened, the gullies filled up, and the highways placed in 
 a reasonably good condition. But unfortunately this 
 mending is usually expected to last throughout the year 
 regardless of situations, travel, or rain. If the road is 
 at all passable it is tolerated. 

Observation and reflection having convinced me that 
 this practice was, in many cases, both expensive and re- 
 prehensible, I tried to induce our supervisors to adopt 
 the plan of keeping the drains ahvays open, but failed ; as 
 they could not be convinced that it would not cost more 
 to go over the roads twice than once, or that it was the 
 amount of labor expended and not the number of times it 
 vras called into service that caused the expense. Fail- 
 ing, as I have said, in this, I prevailed upon them to al- 
 low me to mend the road running through my farm — 
 some three-quarters of a mile in length. This strip of 
 road, partly owing to the nature of the ground and 
 partly to its location, was liable to wash ; and between 
 gullies cut and stones laid bare, it might be usually de- 
 nominated a "bad road." On this piece of road, some 
 fifteen or twenty dollars were expended every spring to 
 place it in a reasonably good condition. When I took 
 charge of it, nearly two years ago, my fii'st effort was to 
 make the ditches on one side, which received the wash- 
 ings of a large tract, wide, not deep, but of sufficient 
 capacity to carry off all the water likely to come into 
 them. I made the crossings likewise capacious, so as to 
 carry across all the water and prevent it from flowing 
 along the wagon routes in the middle of the road. This 
 gave me dirt enough to raise the middle of the road 
 sufficiently. The expense of this work considerably ex- 
 ceeded the sum 1 was authorized by the supervisor to 
 make, but as I felt some pride in having a good road 
 passing my property instead of a bad one, I did not hes- 
 itate to bear the balance myself. 

Now for the result. The road remained good — first- 
 rate — throughout the summer and fall ; but as I had ex- 
 pected the ditches and drains now required some atten- 
 tion, or the probabilities were that parts of the road 
 might be overflowed by the winter rains. I accordingly 
 again dressed them up. The amount of labor required 
 to do this was trifling. 

As I had kept the road so good, I was delegated in 
 the following spring to take charge of it again. With 
 less than one-third the labor previously required the 
 damages of the winter were repaired, and now when six 
 months more have elapsed scarcely any work is needed ; 
 and the probabilities are that five dollars, annually ap- 
 propriated to keep the ditches and drains open, will be 
 all that is sufilcient to maintain a first-rate road, where 
 more than thrice that amount, expended as is customary, 
 would only perpetuate a bad one. J. W.

Compost. 

Mr. Darlington : — Guano, superphosphate, and oth- 
 er excellent manures are not within the reach of the 
 greater number of farmers in this State, and the manure 
 heap, even when well taken care of, is usually too small 
 to supply all the wants of the land. To all such, and 
 many others, composting would be highly serviceable, 
 and as there is now plenty of time to gather together the 
 materials of a compost heap, a hint on that subject may 
 be beneficial to the readers of your Journal. 

Any ingredient containing a fertilizing principle may 
 with advantage enter the compost heap, such as swamp 
 muck, sods and soil from the road side and fence rows, 
 wood mould, leaves, ashes, &c., &c. I have made from 
 fifty to seventy-five loads of valuable compost each win- 
 tor for several years past of the following materials : — 
 I st. A layer of sods and soil from the side of the road, 
 or fence rows, to say six inches thick ; 2d. A layer of 
 stable manure, say two inches thick ; 3d. A layer of 
 woods earth, six inches thick; 4th. All the night soil I 
 could collect ; 5th. A bushel of plaster for every fifteen 
 loads of compost ; 6th. Another layer of sods and woods 
 earth ; 7th. All the refuse wood and coal ashes I could 
 collect. After the lapse of a few weeks, I incorporate 
 the whole together, mixing thoroughly, and spread a 
 little more plaster over the heap when I am done. By 
 the time corn planting arrives, the heap will be ready 
 for use, and is then nearly as valuable as an equal bulk 
 of barnyard manure. The heap should not be too far 
 distant from the wash-house, so that all the suds may be 
 poured over it. S. J. P.

Committees at Exhibitions. 
 Mr. Editor: — Having been a pretty regular attendant 
 during the late Exhibition of the State Society, I was for- 
 cibly struck with the arduous duties of the various com- 
 mittees, and could not fail to perceive, that (although en- 
 tirely unintended on their part,) they necessarily slight- 
 ed the claims of many worthy exhibitors. This was 
 particularly the case in the agricultural implement de- 
 partment, where the display was perhaps the finest ever 
 made in the United States, comprising a sufficient num- 
 ber of new and valuable implements to have employed a 
 dozen committees for a week, instead of three for one 
 day, or at farthest two. For instance committee 18th 
 class 5, were called to decide upon the merits of some 
 twenty five different kinds of farm implements, and perhaps 
 a dozen competitors for each article enumerated in the 
 premium schedule. Is it not simply absurd to suppose 
 that three men, (surrounded as committees generally are
