with a crowd and in the midst of all the excitement of a 
 great exhibition) can approximate to any thing like a 
 correct conclusion in regard to the merits of the multi- 
 tude of articles they are called upon to examine. Were 
 they possessed of the most thorough knowledge of the 
 diflFerent implements — had they had an opportunity of prac- 
 tically testing the value of each, it were asking too much 
 to expect them under such unfavorable circumstances to 
 pronounce with the coi'rectness that should characterise 
 all committee reports, which is best entitled to the appro- 
 bation of the society in the form of awards of premiums 
 &c. While it is only strict justice to presume and believe 
 that the gentlemen who consent to discharge the unen- 
 viable duties of committee men, do so with rigid impar- 
 tiality, it is very clear that their honest intentions are too 
 frequently defeated by the unfavorable circumstances 
 which surround them. Do you not think that a commit- 
 tee would have a sufficiently onerous duty to perform, if 
 in the brief space of time allotted for the discharge of 
 their duties, they should give their whole time and atten- 
 tion to the investigation of the merits of the twenty or 
 thirty diiferent kinds of hay straw and fodder cutters, 
 which are generally exhibited at State Fairs; of how 
 much more value both to exhibitors and the public then 
 examinations and awards would be. The same might be 
 said of corn shellers. A committee would have their 
 hands full enough in examining this important branch 
 of the implement department. There should be a com- 
 mittee for reaping and mowing machines, another for 
 grain fans and seed separators, a third for smaller har- 
 vesting implements, and in fact the duties of the three or 
 four committees on implements might very appropiately 
 be divided amongst at least a dozen diiferent committees. 
 If it be urged as an objection to increasing the number of 
 committee that they cannot readily be filled, I answer 
 that if the duties of committees are narrowed down to a 
 particular class of implcTuents, and those who are ap- 
 pointed made aware of the fact that instead of being 
 compelled to drag through a wearisome and unsatisfac- 
 tory examination of twenty or thirty different kinds of 
 implements, their attention need be directed to one par- 
 ticular kind, many men would willingly serve on com- 
 mittee who now shrink alarmed at the very thought of 
 the task before them. 

Instead of murmurings and discontent so frequently 
 manifest on the part of exhibitors, a much better feeling 
 would prevail, disappointed competitors could find no rea- 
 sonable ground of complaint, because, (presuming always 
 that the decision of the committees are impartial) they 
 will have had an ample opportunity of displaying and 
 explaining the good qualities of their respective articles, 
 and could not fail to feel convinced that there were others 
 of a superior character on exhibition. Besides, this, the 
 premiums of the society would then have some value in 
 the eye of the public. At present they are regarded as 
 of little value and mainly because of the reasons I have 
 assigned. I have attended all of our State Fairs, and 
 in many instances been surprised at the decisions of com- 
 mittees. I have seen first premiums awarded to imple- 
 ments which were comparatively valueless, and yet I 
 liave not the slightest doubt that the conmiittee acted ag 
 they supposed in the strictest accordance with their hon- 
 est impression. 

It should always be borne in mind that when inventora 
 and manufacturers exhibit their articles, they generally 
 select such persons to explain them as are possessed of the 
 "gift of gab" and who by previous preparation are very 
 well calculated to deceive and mislead a committee. I 
 have seen modest men, whose powers of explanation 
 were completely paralysed as soon as a commttee asked 
 them to describe their wares, and from the fact that mere 
 verbal explanations too are often all the evidences a com- 
 mittee has time to receive, these men have lost the award 
 which would certainly have been theirs, could they have 
 had an opportunity of practically exhibiting the value of 
 their implements. 

I trust that these evils ^vill be remedied hereafter, and 
 that the duties of committees will de so divided as to 
 permit them to devote to each particular class the time 
 and attention which it deserves. OBSERVER. 

The Old Farmer's Elegy. 

BY JOSIAII T. CANNl.NG. 

J. L. Darlington, Esq. — My Dear Sir : — In reading tho 
 enclosed linos how is one reminded of the many who now 
 rest in peace beneath the turf, at West Chester and Birming- 
 ham, with no memorial but tho grass upon their graves, un- 
 less it be tho still prevailing influence of their many vir- 
 tues. 

I hope they mny prove acceptable to the many readers of 
 the Farm Journal, whose acknowled interest and usefulness 
 13 advanced by every now issue. 

Your friend and scrv't, 
 and constant reader, 

Philadelphia, Oct. 20tb, 1854. W. H. D. 

On a green grassy knoll, by tho banks of tho brook, 
 That so long and so often has watered his flock, 
 Tho old farmer rests in his long and last sleep, 
 While tho waters a low, lapsing lullabj- keep. 

He has ploughed his last furrow, has reaped Lis last grain, 

No morn shall awake him to labour again. 

Yon tree that with fragrance is filling the air. 

So rich with its blossoms, so thrifty and fair, 

By his own hand was planted; and well did ho say, 

It would live when its planter had mouldered away. 

Ho has ploughed his last furrow, has reaped his last grain, 

No morn shall awake him to labour again. 

Thfiro's the well that he dug, with its waters so cold, 
 AVith its wet dripping bucket, so mos.'^y and old, 
 No more from its depths by the patriarch drawn, 
 For "tho pitcher is broken," tho old man is gone. 

Ho has ploughed his 1-Lst furrow, has reaped his last grain, 

No morn shall awake him to labour again. 

'Twa? a gloom-giving day when the old farmer died; 

Tho stout-hearted mourned, tiio aflectionate cried; 

And the prayers of tho just for his rest did ascend. 

For they all lost a brother, a man, and a friend. 
 He has ploughed his last furruw, has reaped his lust grain, 
 No morn shall awake him to labour again. 

For upright and honest the old farmer was ; 

His God ho revered, ho respected tho laws ; 

Though fearless ho lived, ho has gone where liis worth 

Will outshine like pure gold all tho dross of tho earth. 
 He has ploughed his last furrow, has reaped his last grain, 
 No morn shall awake him to labour again. 

Moles. 
 To tho Editors of the Pennsylvania Farm Journal: — Per- 
 mit ma through tho columns of your excellent Journal to 
 make some inquiries of my brotlicr farmers ns to tho bopt 
 method of destroying tho common molo. A largo portion 
 of my farm is completely undermined with molos, especially 
 tho two fields in which I contemplate j>lanting corn nest
