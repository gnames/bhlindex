[December 

season, and I entertain fears lest a large part of mj' crop 
 may be destroyed or greatly injured by their depredations. 
 I have frequently thought of preparing some corn with poi- 
 son iind then making a small hole in the raised earth, drop 
 a few grains in a place about over the field, but I am at a 
 loss to know what to use as the best destroyer. I have kept 
 two traps sot all the proceeding summer and have caught 
 forty-one in various ways. One of my neighbors tells mo 
 his boy has caught thirty -seven in one track without ever 
 moving the trap, I trust some one of the subscribers or 
 rather readers of your widely circulated journal will have 
 discovered some remedy ere this, and if so will no doubt be 
 happy to communicate the same to others.

 The True Art of Feeding Animals. 

BY J. S. IIOUGUTON, M. D. 

Much assistance in the art of feeding animals, whetherfor 
 work, for beef, or for dairy purposes, may be obtained from 
 a careful study of the recent developments in organic chem- 
 istry. 

I have noticed in the agricultural papers frequent ac- 
 counts of experiments in feeding, which failed entirely in 
 consequence of ignorance of the most simple principles of 
 animal chemittry and physiology. Thus one writer, lately, 
 denounces earrrots and turnips as useless food for milch 
 cows, because, while feeding them, with hay, the milk and 
 butter did not increase but rather declined; and the writer 
 states that he then grew onions in place of carrots, sold the 
 onions, and with the money bought wheat bran, which had 
 a better effect when fed to his cows as slop, increasing the 
 quantity of butter immediately to a very satisfactory a- 
 mount. 

The difficulty in this experiment was this : not that the 
 carrots were unsuited to milch cows, but they were not, oven 
 with hay, a complete food, or not well adapted to produce 
 butter. The carrot, of course, contains a large proportion of 
 water, a good deal of sugar, and considerable nutritive or 
 flesh-forming substance, but not much oil, or fatty matter. 
 To make butter in large quantity, with certainty, some food 
 should be used containing oil, and this may, of course, be 
 found in corn or linseed meal, or in wheat bran. The hull 
 or bran of all grains contains much more oil, in proportion 
 to its weight, than the interior substance. It is consequent- 
 ly more fattening, and will produce more butter than the 
 same weight of whole grain. 

Food is now divided by chemists into the flosh-forraing, or 
 nutritious, and the fattening, or breathing food; and by un- 
 derstanding clearly the meaning of these terms, much light 
 may be thrown upon the art of feeding animals and men. 
 Lot us try and explain this subject to those who are not 
 familiar with it. 

When an animal, or a man, moves or labors, he breaks up 
 his muscle, or the solid parts of his flesh, (the red meat, so 
 to speak, as you see it in a piece of beef,) and throws off from 
 his body, through various channels of excretion, a material 
 called nitrogen in chemistry (the same thing essentially as 
 ammonia), which is the important principle in all solid 
 flesh, in the white of egg, in the solid part of the oyster, in 
 tlio curd of milk, and in the nutritious part of the pea, cab- 
 bage, &c. I purposely omit sciontifio details in this de- 
 scription, so as not to confuse the general reader, and sacri- 
 fice strict accuracy to simplicity. A working man, or work- 
 ing animal, therefore, needs, to supply tho waste of his 
 muscles by labor, an adequate proportion of nutritious food, 
 or that which contains nitrogen (ammonia), the chief ele- 
 ment of flesh, eggs, oysters, &c. 

But during labor the animal, or man, also breathes, and 
 during the act of breathing important chemical changes go 
 on in his lungs, and large quantities of fat, or its equivalent, 
 such as starch, sugar, gum, oil, &c., are consumed, just as oil 
 is consumed in a lamp by a process analagous to combustion, 
 by which tho body is heated, the blood is purified of excess 
 of lifeless matter, and other important results are produced 
 in the animal body. Hence the demand for the so-called 
 fattening or breathing food to supply the consumption of this 
 material by the lungs, which is much greater in cold weath- 
 er, and out of doors, than it is in warm weather, or in a warm 
 uoom. 

Now, with these principles before us, we have only to in- 
 quire into the constituents of the articles used as food to bo 
 able to adapt them, with a good deal of certainty, to tho ob- 
 ject wo may have in view in feeding animals. 

If we have a working animal, we must give him nitro- 
 genized or nutritious food in large proportion, not neglect- 
 ing, however, an adequate supply of breathing food to keep 
 him sufficiently fat and warm. 

If we desire to fatten an animal, then the carbonaceous, oily 
 or fattening food must be used more freely, and loss of the 
 flesh-forming or highly nutritious food will answer. 

If milk, and not butter, bo the object, then watery food, 
 not too highly nutritious or too oily, is to be desired, being 
 careful to secure that which is slightly stimulating, and 
 properly supplied with phosphoric acid, or phosphate of 
 lime. 

For butter, watery, somewhat nutritious and very highly 
 carbonized, or oily food, should be used, that which contains 
 much starch, sugar, gum, oil, <fec. 

To make cheese, nutritious food, such as beans, peas, cab- 
 bage, good hay, with some roots and corn meal, should be 
 sought, or, in other words, those articles of food which con- 
 tain in the greatest abundance, vegetable albumen, caseine 
 or curd, the nitrogenized or flesh-making principle. 

If a person, not familiar with chemistry, should ask how 
 he is to ascertain the character and qualities of all articles 
 employed as food for animals and men, without learning tho 
 whole science, I answer that numerous works furnish analy- 
 ses of such substances, but no single work more fully than 
 '■Peroira's Treatise on Food and Diet," an edition of which 
 was published by Fowlers &, AVells, of New Y'ork, at fifty 
 cents in paper covers, or seventy-five cents in cloth. Dr. 
 Pereira is a standard writer on such subjects, and reliable 
 authority. 

"Are turnips good for pigs ?" inquires one writer in a late 
 agricultural paper. One person says yes — another no. "Are 
 beans good for horses ?'' is the question put forth by another 
 correspondent, and tho same contradictory answers are giv- 
 en by different persons. The simple truth is, turnips are 
 good for pigs and beans are good for horses, but not alone, 
 or unmixed with other food. Neither turnips nor beans aro 
 fattening; they are highly nutritious, and beans particularly 
 are well suited to working animals, but require corn me.al, 
 oats or other grains to supply the loss of carbon by the 
 lungs, and of phosphoric acid from the bones and brain. 

Carrots and oats, or carrots and wheat bran, or beans and 
 corn meal, would be good food for horses, with hay. Tur- 
 nips and corn meal, or turnips and shorts, would be suitable 
 feed for pigs. Carrots and corn meal, or carrots and oil 
 cake, with hay, would be complete food for milch cows. 
 ' Men, in feeding themselves, are led by a sort of natural 
 instinct or craving to select food well adapted to their wants. 
 Thus fat pork and cabbage form a favorite dish of the work- 
 ing classes, a combination of aliment well adapted to their 
 necessities, furnishing in the cabbage the nutritious or flesh- 
 forming substance (nitrogen), and in the oily pork the car-
