bonaceous or "breathing food. People who do not work 

much, or breathe much in the opoa air, cannot relish pork 
 ftud cabbage, and to some persons who lead idle lives with- 
 in doors the very odor of tliis dish, so attractive to the la- 
 borer, is positively disgusting. 

Wheat bread and butter, with tea, furnish a complete and 
 satisfactory food for persons who do not labor ; milk, or 
 bread and milk, also form a- perfect aliment for children 
 who exert themselves only in play. Fat beef or mutton is 
 a complete food for even laboring men, as it affords nitrogen 
 and carbon in due proportion. 

There is another Well known principle which it is desira- 
 ble to bear in mind, it is this : that hulk of food, as well as 
 nitrogen and carbon, is necessary to keep all animals and 
 men in a state of health. Too much concentrated food in 
 small bulk, however well adapted to effect the object in view, 
 will not answer so well as the same nutriment and carbon 
 combined with some bulk}- innutritions matter. A story is 
 told of two horses on board a ship, which were fed equally 
 upon oats, without hay; cue of them had access to a pile of 
 shiugles, which he gnawed freely, and endured a long voy- 
 iigo in good health ; the other had no woody, libre or othei- 
 coarse material to oat, and died in consequence. 

An animal maj', of course, be fatted more speedily and 
 cheaply in a warm season, or in a warm room, than when 
 the air is oolder and more condensed, and when more food 
 is consumed by the lungs to keep up the heat of the body; 
 hn; in a warm atmosphere, this food would be moi'e freely 
 deposited in the body of the animal as fat, and not so large- 
 ly burnt oil by combustion in the lungs. Hence, too, men 
 going to a warm climate are advised by physicians to use 
 little fat moat and corn bread, which are highly carbonace- 
 ous, as they supply too much of the elements of bilo to the 
 system in such climates,- and have a direct tendency to pro- 
 duce liver complaint, bilious disorder and fever. 

The subject here presented is one of great interest and 
 importance, and demands more extended consideration than 
 we can give it in this article. We only open it to the rea- 
 der, and hope at least to make him see (if he has not ob- 
 served it before) that food for animals and men should be 
 properly mixed, and scientifically adapted to climate, habits 
 of life, and.the various objects of feeding, and that no single 
 Tegatablo substance, scarcely, can be a complete food under 
 all circumstances for horses, pigs, cows, or men.

National Agriciilture. 

The toUil value of the annual products of the soil of the 
 United Stiites is now about One Thousand Millions of Doll- 
 ars ; and no one who knows what science has done for Agri- 
 culture, will doubt that tiie same amount of labor which is 
 now employed in producing this aggregate, might be so ap- 
 plied .as to secure a total product thirty per cent, greater, or 
 One Thousand Three Hundred Jlillions. But scientific, 
 skillful, thorough Agriculture always employs more than the 
 shiftless, slouching sort too generally prevjilont; and it is 
 certainly within bounds to estimate that our Agriculture 
 might be so improved ns, by the help of additional labor 
 now unemployed and unproductive, to give an additonal 
 product of fifty per cent, or Five Hundred Millions per 
 annum — an achievement which would double the wealth 
 of the country every eight or ton years. AVliosoover 
 will carefully review the Agriculture of a single state, or o, 
 yen an average County, in any part of the Union, and esti- 
 mate how n^uch its product might be enhanced by irriga- 
 tion, manuring, deep plowiu"^, draining, <te., will perceive 
 that our calculation is fir within the truth. 

But euppo?e that only half of it, or an addition to our na- 

tional wealth would thereby be insured ! Four-fifths of this 
 would probably be permantly added to the wealth of the 
 country — that is, the farmer whose annual product should 
 be swelled from $1,000 to $1,250, or from $2,000 to $2,506, 
 would not eat or drink up the surplus, but would invest the 
 greator part of it in new buildings, fences, barns, implements, 
 furniture, &c., &c., giving profitable employment to mechan- 
 ics and laborers, and largely increasing the business of mor- 
 hants and the incomes of professional men. Such an ad- 
 dition to the annual product of our Agriculture would in- 
 crease the consumption of Manufactures, domestic and im- 
 ported, in for greater ratio, since from the annual product of 
 every farm the food of those making a living on it must first 
 be taken forborne use, affording no business or profit to any 
 one else, leaving only the surplus to form the staple of trade; 
 and an addition of twenty-five per cent, to the annual pro- 
 duct of each farm would probablj' double the .annual ex- 
 changes and general trade of the country. — X. Y. Tribune,

Soils and their Improvemont. 

M'aring, in his "Elements of Agriculture," makes the 
 following common sense remarks rolalivo to soils and their 
 improvement :" — Chemical analysis will tell us the compo- 
 sition of a soil, and an examination, such as any farmer 
 may make, will inform ns of its deficiencies in mechanical 
 character, and we ma}- at once resort to the proper means 
 to secure fertility. In some instances the soil may contain 
 every thing that is required, but not in the necessary condi- 
 tion. For instance, in some parts of Massachusetts, there 
 are nearly barren soils which show by analysis precisely the 
 same chemical composition as the soil of the Miami valley 
 of Ohio, one of the most fertile in the world. The cause of 
 this great difTerenee in their agricultural capabilities, is that 
 the Miami soil has its particles finely pulverised; while in 
 the Massachusetts soil the ingredients are combined within 
 particle? (such as pebbles, etc.), where they are out of the 
 reach of roots. 

In other cases, we find two soils, which are equally well 
 pulverized, and which appear to be of the same character, 
 having very different power to support crops. Chemical a- 
 nalj-sis will show in these instances of a difference or com- 
 position. 

All of these differences may be overcome by the use of 
 the proper means. Sometimes it could be done at an ex- 
 pense which would be justified by the result ; and, at others, 
 it might require too large an outlay to be profitable. It be- 
 comes a question of economj-, not of ability, and science is 
 able to estimate the cost 

Soil cannot he cultivated understandingly until it has 
 been suhjected to such an examination as will tell us exact- 
 ly what is necessary to render it fertile. Even after fertili- 
 ty is perfectly restored, it requires thought and care to main- 
 tain it. The ingredients of the soil must be returned in the 
 form of manures as largely as they are removed by the crop, 
 or the supply will evontuallj- become too small for the pur- 
 poses of vegetation." 

Address of Gen. George May Keim, 

Before the Schvylkill County Agricultural Societi/, October 

I9th, 1854. 

Mn. Prksident and Gknti.emen: — That nation whose 
 agriculture is prosperous is foremost in civilization, whiLst 
 an inability to supply food betokens a weak government, in 
 constjint dread of famine, and a total lack of independence. 
 Of old, agriculture was known as the nursing mother of the 
 arts, for Xenophon has shown that "where it prospers the 
 arts thrive, but where the earth is uncultivated, there the 
 other arts are destroyed." 

It may justly be termed a school of industry, which
