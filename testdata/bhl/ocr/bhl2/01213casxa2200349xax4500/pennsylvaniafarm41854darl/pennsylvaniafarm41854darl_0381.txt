that never can bo retrieved. Schemes and projects, howev- 
 er impracticablo and speculative, are induced into plausible 
 shape, and exhibit a disgusting picture of speculation and 
 artifice, in which not only our law-givers participate, but the 
 very Miuistorsof the Constitution have been willing to lend 
 their superior service. A desertion of gradual means for a 
 sudden and alluring prospect of gain has degraded nations 
 in the scale of power. Our own California, with all her fas- 
 cinations, has cost U3 more than she has yet paid ; Spain, 
 like a spider, sits couching upon the ruins of her former gran- 
 deur, and the celebrated cities of the Hanseatio league pre- 
 sent a Melancholy contrast to their once formidable power. 
 The strength of our national prosperity consists in the even 
 tenor, the energy and firmness of our agricultural popula- 
 tion, who sook not by sudden exertions to oliviate the neces- 
 sity of future labor, but rely on their own efforts for the sup- 
 ply of every want, and for a resource under every emergency. 
 The husbandman in a free country occupies the first rank 
 amongst men. Instead of soliciting tho favor, accommoda- 
 ting himself to the caprice, or administering to tho vanities 
 of mankind, he enters upon an equable and uniform career. 
 The changes of the seasons and the operations of the ele- 
 ments, are subjects whoso nature he studios and to whoso 
 variations ho conforms his practice. His vigilance never 
 slumbers, but inspires a shrewd caution without that despi- 
 cable cunning, which is acquired by bending to the humour 
 of the times, and speculating on the changes of tho fashions. 
 Thus the art to ivhich ho is devoted, as far as it tends to ele- 
 vate tho mind and create a dignity of sentiment, must be 
 allowed to rank among the pursuits of life, as higher and 
 more worthy of his being. Look, if you please, for a mo- 
 ment at his present condition. In what dilemma is now the 
 farming interest of the country? Where is its indebted- 
 ness? With what wild adventure has it become involved? 
 Commerce, confused and precarious, ideal projects of vast 
 extent, commenced upon groundless promises, are fast sink- 
 ing into that insignificance to which a want of means con- 
 signs them. But this confusion presents to him no alarm, 
 he has relied upon the bountiful resources of his well tilled 
 soil, aad invested in no adventure than that which long ex- 
 rience has sanctioned, and sound judgment approved. Al- 
 most all the classical authors, whether statesmen, philoso- 
 phers or poets, have left some memento upon this art. What 
 Hesiod, Xenophon, Cato, Columella, and Cicero, deemed 
 worthy of their regard, remained for Virgil to adorn with 
 tho eloquence of his poetic genius. The whole theory of 
 farming is found in tho instructions left ns by Cato, that 
 "the first thing to be done is to plough well, the second to 
 plough, and the third to manure." In 1534 tho first book 
 on English husbandry, by Judge Fitzherbert, was published. 
 Ai'ter him, Gabriel Plattos published a dissertation, which 
 invites attention only for its quahitness of style. His di- 
 rections how to discover a coal mine is part of his subject, 
 and may afl'ord some amusement if nothing else. He re- 
 marks : "AVhen I consider the great number of treasures 
 and riches which lyeth hidden in the belly of the earth, and 
 doth no good at all, and when I consider that the most part 
 of the mines hitherto discovered have come by mero acci- 
 dent, I thought that I could not be better employed than to 
 give rules and directions for the samo, for though it is not 
 impossible that if two men be sent to seek a thing that is 
 lost, and one of them bo hoodwinked and the other have the 
 use and benefit of his eyes, yet tho person hoodwinked may 
 casually stumble upon it, nevertheless it is twenty to one 
 that the other should have found it before him. So in this 
 case, I dare hazard a wager of twenty to one, that there will 
 be more good mines discovered within seven years by these 
 rules and directions than have been in twenty-seven years 
 before. Though tho pit coals be of small value, yet if a good 
 mine be discovered, herein is a receipt for tho purpose. 
 About the middle of Maj', when the subterranean vapors

that time will suddenly grow out of the earth in a night or 
 two, almost a handful in length, then take a pure white 
 piece of tiffany and wet it in the dew of tho grass which is 
 all of that spring's growth, and not soiled with cattle nor no 
 other thing, then wring out tho dew from it, and do so fivo 
 or six times, and if there bo coals the tiffany will bo a little 
 blacked and made foul with the sooty vapours arising 
 through tho coals and condensed among tho dew. I admon- 
 ish him that shall try with the tiffany upon the dew, to lot 
 his hands be washed before with soap and hot 'vater, and 
 wiped with a pure white cloth till they will not foul the cloth 
 at all, else if they spend their money in digging and find 
 nothing, they may thank their foul fingers for that misfor- 
 tune." 

Sir William Temple, in 1680, thus treats upon gardening : 
 "That which makes the care of gardening more necessary 
 or at least more excuseable, is, that all men eat fruit that 
 can get it. So as tho choice is only whether one will eat 
 good or ill, and between these tho difference is not greater 
 in point of taste and delicacy than it is of health, for who- 
 ever is used to eat good fruit will do very great penance 
 when he comes to ill. Now whoever will be suro to eat good 
 fruit must do it out of a garden of his own, for there is 
 something very nice in gathering them and choosing the 
 best, even from the same tree. Tho best fruit that is bought 
 has no more of the master's care than how to raise the 
 greatest gains. His business is to have as much fruit as he 
 can upon as few trees, whereas, the way to have it excellent 
 is to have but little upon many trees. So that for all things 
 out of a garden, either of sallad or fruits, a poor man will 
 eat better that has one of his own, than a rich man that Las 
 none." 

It was left for Jethro Tull to suggest the wonderful ad- 
 vantages of drill culture, by which an impulse was given to 
 the better construction of the tools and implements of hus- 
 bandry. The primitive instruments of the days of Gideon 
 and Saul, when iron was unknown, and ploughs made of 
 crooked roots pointed with ox horns, were now no longer 
 used to torture the rugged earth into obedience. Mathe- 
 matical precision and accuracy, and a goodly stirring up of 
 the earth, were accomplished by the drill invention of Je- 
 thro Tull. Although it was to the improvements of tho 
 present day, as Franklin's kite compared with the Electric 
 Telegraph, yet tho conception onco achieved, the thought 
 indurated and spread abroad, becoming a new incentive to 
 additional efforts in saving labor and perfecting tho mechan- 
 ical machinery of culture. Whitney's cotton gin sprang 
 from this source, and created a staple commodity for this 
 country, that otherwise, from tho high rate of labor, could 
 not have been made available. The hoe-harrow, the plough, 
 tho roller, the clod-crusher, tho rake, the corn-plough, the 
 mower, tho reaper and thresher, with daily accessions to 
 their number, are constantly being rendered more effective 
 and useful. The application of chemistry to agriculture is 
 comparatively of modern date. To Doctor Priestly are we 
 indebted for the first experiments, that demonstrated the 
 decomposition of tho carbonic acid of tho atmosphere, by 
 leaves of vegetables giving out oxygen and assimilating 
 carbon. Sir Humphrey Davy, taking this initiative, occu- 
 pied himself with every pliilosophical inquiry in tho appli- 
 cation of chemistry to the growth of plants and organic pro- 
 cesses. 

Liebig, professing to follow in the train of Davy, by min- 
 ute research and devoted study, has applied tho physical 
 sciences to agriculture, until the laws of vitality which 
 govern the functions of plants, are fast ceasing to bo a mys- 
 tery. 

Tho necessity for somo means of renovation and render- 
 ing fertile worn out and exhausted lands, is of tho greatest 
 importance. The work of destruction is going on to so 
 groat an extent, that in after time, what now is a smiling 
 prairie, may become a desolate waste. Tho sugar and cot-
