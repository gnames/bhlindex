ton planters doom the refuse of their crops so great an im- 
 pedimciit to their pros&nt coiivenienc-e, that they cither erect 
 hiyh chimnios in order to burn them, or olse cast them into 
 the neighboring streams as a nuisance. The corn growers 
 of the wesst have simiLr troubles, whilst the grain growers 
 of the north are being admonished bj' the diminution of re- 
 sults, and the reduced avera^'o of product per acre, that the 
 earlier cultivators had better have hoarded those resources 
 with more care, is the sad experience of their descendants. 
 Science has been providentially and wisely directed to these 
 investigations, in determining the various ingredients of the 
 soil and their relative qualities, in ascertaining their combi- 
 nation, and in the application thereof to plants ; not to 
 plants only can this research bo limited, but animals, birds 
 and insects, their structure, habits and manners, are features 
 indispensably necessarj' to be known. Science also teaches 
 us that the laws of nature are unchangeable, and that all 
 the phenomena which matter eAolves are the result of these 
 law5. Thus, to gather causes from effects, to assign to each 
 igency its share in the growth of plants, becomes an object 
 of instruction and profit. 

To ask that every farmer should become a chemist, is re- 
 cuestiug more than his arduous duties would permit, but 
 that he should avail himself of the advantages arising there- 
 from, would be an evidence of knowing his best interests 
 and minding his own business. 

He would learn that the principal property of a potato is 
 potash; that of wheat, rye, corn and buckwheat, is phos- 
 phoric acid; of corn stalks, soda; of meadow hay, silica; 
 and of clover, lime. The food that plants obtain from the 
 air are oxygen and hydrogen, although nitrogen composes 
 4-5ths of the atmosphere, yet, it is said, that plants do not 
 receive it directly from this source but from its compounds, 
 as in rain water, and as ammonia, which consists of nitrogen 
 and hydrogen. Carbon, which is also contained in the at- 
 mosphere, enters largely into and forms the greatest con- 
 stituent of all plants; it is but 1-500 part of the atmosphere. 
 The inquiry may be made, as nature supplies such an excess 
 of nitrogen, and requires so little, whilst carbon is so small 
 a constituent and yet so much required, whether these are 
 not among the impcnitrabilia of nature into which science 
 has not yet been permitted to enter? The organic food is 
 from the air, and the inorganic from the soil, composed 
 chieflj' of soda, potash, magnesia, sulphuric acid, phosphoric 
 acid, chlorine, silica and lime. This, then, is the theory of 
 agricultural chemistry. It proposes to define the component 
 parts of the soil and atmosphere, and by an analysis of the 
 products which are cultivated, it supplies by artificial means 
 to the soil again those properties of which the crops de- 
 prived it It is true, that the processes by which plants ab- 
 sorb these different elements are not yet understood, and it 
 has been questioned whether mineral manure, or ammonia, 
 is the most advantageous to those processes. Experiments 
 in the field can alone determine the fact, although it is safe 
 to say that groat benefits result from the use of both. This 
 is emphatically an age in which there seems to bo a perfect 
 epidemic for books on every subject, and agriculture comes 
 in for a large share. Too frequently, however, more is 
 claimed for a discovery or invention than it deserves ; as of 
 yore, the alchemist professed to make gold by means of a 
 refined and mystical powder, applied to the inferior metals, 
 80 the pretensions of the bibliopole promise many more ad- 
 vantages than can be realized; whore so much is doing, 
 some new theme of agitation is constantly invoked, so as to 
 afford interest and variety, and thus insure a sale of the book 
 itself, or the patent fertilizer it may recommend. It has 
 become a reproach to us, that our attachment to old customs 
 prevents any attempt at the introduction of improvements. 
 This is an unjust imputation. If you cast your eye upon 
 the counties of Lancaster, Berks, Lehigh, Northampton and 

York, and compare the refreshing aspect they present with 
 any other agricultural region in the Commonwealth, j'ou 
 will find the cycle of crops as well understood and practised 
 as in any part of the world, wherever wages rule at the 
 same rate. They seek to learn the truth of an experiment 
 before it is adopted, and whilst Ihey are conscious that many 
 operations upon the farm may bo more effectual in results, 
 yet the question of expense is often an evidence of the inu- 
 tility arising from it. What avails the increase of products 
 if the cost thereof exceeds the profit? Men of unlimited 
 means may amuse themselves by every suggestion that the- 
 ory presents, but the soil is expected to remunerate the hus- 
 bandman, or else his labor is bestowed in vain. Lot it not 
 I be said that there is an aversion to improvement, since so 
 much is expected by inventors and patentees, that it would 
 require more than a farm is worth to j'icld a trial to all the 
 projects they choose to offer. 

In agricultural pursuits it is better to be cautious of inno- 
 vations, than to be led away too hastily by everj' suggestion 
 that finds its waj' in print from an irresponsible soui'ce. If 
 the cardinal virtues of the husbandman, industry, temper- 
 ance, economy and prudence, are wanting, he looks in vain 
 for success or prosperitj' from any quarter, experimental or 
 practical. The sooner he closes his account current with 
 our good and benign Mother Earth, the better it will be for 
 him and posterity, for men cannot "gather grapes of thorns, 
 or figs of thistles." Usages honored in memory have most- 
 ly answered a good purpose, as the custom of looking into 
 the almanac for a propitious sign at least establishes a time 
 and a season for work, if even the moon has no influence 
 upon the operation. Too much attention to the mechanical 
 labor cannot well be exerted upon land. Every stone that 
 can be removed adds to the facility of working it, and if it 
 could be afforded, spado culture is known to be more perfect 
 and successful than any other, because the regular pulveri- 
 zation of the whole is more complete than by any other 
 method. The fertility of a soil must be repaired, not only 
 by proper plowing and hoeing, that it may be subjected to 
 atmospheric influences, but it must also bo fed with such 
 substances as afford nutriment to vegetation. This is done 
 by manure. Whilst science has shown that there are many 
 sources from which the manure heaps may bo replenished, 
 there has as yet been no denial of the value, nor has any 
 substitute been preferred to the old fa-hioned modicum, 
 commonly known as barnyard manure. This has been, 
 heretofore, the main reliance of farmers, and when applied 
 abundantly has never been known to fail. Yet the inven- 
 tions of concentrated manures, such as can be purchased at 
 a reasonable price, and possess fertilizing qualities, is a pow- 
 erful aid to those who have not the opportunity of procuring 
 a better restorative to a worn out soil. 

The water or moisture in barnyard manure is generally 
 4-5ths of the whole, so that the expense of labor for every 
 twenty tons upon the field embraces the item sixteen tons of 
 water. These twenty tons, it is contended, are not more 
 eflScacious than 500 lbs. of super-phosphate of lime. It is 
 an excellent excitement to the growth of clover, which in 
 this part of the country has long been considered the 
 chief support of a good system of husbandry. Various oth- 
 er chemical inventions are found in the market, but the su- 
 per-phosphate of lime, made of bones dissolved in sulphuric 
 acid, to which is added ammonia, seems to bear the palm of 
 merit. Another recent invention of adding dried blood to 
 super-phosphate of lime, in order to nitrogenate it, is spoken 
 of. Whether the potash, ammonia, lime, magnesia, chlo- 
 rine, phosphorous, sulphur and soda, which may be wanted, 
 can be thus supplied, is questionable. From my own ex- 
 perience, the super-phosphate of lime, although an excellent 
 renovator, induces the growth of smut and orgot, in the ex- 
 cess of free phosphoric acid. Public attention for some time
