has been directed to guano, as likely to prove an invaluable 
 adjunct to revive fertility. The interest of the national debt 
 of Peru is paid by the sale of this article alone. Such is its 
 wonderful effect, that they have a proverb, "although guauo 
 is no saint, it performs many miracles." It is supposed in 
 the present year the exports of guano to all ports may reach 
 300,000 tons, paying to the government of Peru $20 per ton, 
 or six millions of dollars profit. Of this amount the United 
 States receive about 100,000 tons, being an increase of 95,000 
 tons over the first shipment of 1845. There are other guano 
 deposits elsewhere, but of inferior qualit}'. Owing to the 
 great demand for this article, Engli.sh and American mer- 
 chants, ever on the alert, by advances and loans to Peru, 
 have obtained peculiar privileges in the trade, until at 
 length the price has reached the exorbitant sum of $54 per 
 ton. At such rate it ceases to be remunerative to the far- 
 mer, as the crop will be absorbed by the expenses incident 
 to it. Efibrts are making by the United States to have the 
 price reduced, but thus far negotiations have failed. Peru 
 owns the Islands from whence it is taken, and which in fact 
 are but the roosts of sea birds. As it never rain-s there the 
 dung accumulates, which, together with the spray of the sea 
 and the refuse of dead birds and garbage, form this invalua- 
 ble compost. The States of Maryland and Virginia have 
 chemists specially authorized to investigate every lot tliat 
 arrives, so that purchasers are assured of the quality the}' 
 acquire. 

Tlie following very valuable compound, or artificial guano, 
 has met with groat favor in Virginia, and may be prepared 
 at a cost of fifteen dollars per ton : 

Poultry dung, 10 bushels. 

Mould from pine woods, 10 " 

Fine bono dust 3 " 

Ground Gypsum, 3 " 

Nitrate of Sodii, 40 pounds. 

Sal Ammoniac 22 "

Sulphate of Soda, .' 20 " 

Sulphate of Magnesia, 10 " 

Common Salt, 10 " 

Dissolve Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, in water sufliciont 
 therefor, and then add the whole together as if making mor- 
 tar, putting in the gypsum last. Keep in a drj- place, cov- 
 ered, so as to exclude the air until used. This will answer 
 for six acres of land. 

In this region, the .ibundance of anthracite coal dust may 
 bo considered an excellent means of assisting the fertility of 
 the soil, particularly when composed of clay. Owing to its 
 black color, it absorbs heat to a greater extent than clay, 
 and acts mochanically in rendering the soil friable, loose, 
 and permeable to the air. It contains 90 per cent, of car- 
 bon, and frequently traces of sulphur, the latter is always 
 subject to the action of the atmo.'<phero. Although the car- 
 bonic element may be too concrete to be soluble in water, 
 yet the usual action of the weather tends to promote decaj', 
 which is also hastened hy the coal being a large absorbent 
 of water. What is mineral anthracite was once living 
 plants that abstracted carbon from the air, which by burn- 
 ing, or the slower atmospheric decomposition, is returned 
 again to bo appropriated to the uses of vegetation. 

To rely upon artificial manures as a universal remedy for 
 wast^'d soils, is to elongnte the suggestion with the same en- 
 thusiasm that homeopathy asks its followers to take occa- 
 sional doses from the fragrance of an empty vial. Many of 
 the conclusions of physical science are as yet upon the 
 threshhold of their subject, among the intricacies of which, 
 the greatest point to be understood, is the existence of an 
 universal power that governs organic structuro. 

To deny the value of mineral manures, as lime and gyp- 
 sum, would ran counter to the judgment of every practical 
 observer, and in view of their admitted efficacy, are there 
 not other minerals that uiight be advantageously applied to 
 the soil? Phosphorus, that enters largely into the material 
 of crops, is equally important with lime and gypsum. Ev- 
 ery 100 bu.-^hels of wheat contains GO lbs. of phosphoric 
 acid. It occurs in the fo.ssiliferou3 rocks below the coal for- 
 mation, yet, as a component part of minerals, it is rare. 
 From its scarcity among minerals, and the great require- 
 ment that some plants have for it, the phosphate of lime de- 
 serves a, fair trial. The reason that guano answers so good 
 a purpose is, that like barn-jard manure, it contains all the 
 elements that promote the growth of plants. One of the 
 most powerful and simple means of saturating the ammonia 
 of. manure, or fecal substances, is sulphate of iron, which is 
 abundantly found in every coal mine of your county. What 
 is commonly known as sour tcatci; so deleterious to steam 
 boilers, is, the diluted mixture of gulphiu'ic acid, iron and 
 water, which, if evaporated to dryness, would form the cop- 
 peras of commerce, an article of great use in coloring pro- 
 cesses. If applied to the dung-hill, ii will combine with 
 the ammonia and convert it ibto a fixed salt, that would 
 thus be saved. The numerous topics to which the husband- 
 man yields his' attention, such as ploughing, rotation of 
 crops, selection and treatment of seeds, soiling and fatten- 
 ing cattle, harvesting, irrigating and draining, are constant- 
 ly subject to his closest investigation. There is no depart- 
 ment of his pursuit that can be neglected, and every day's 
 experience teaches him the truth of poor Richard's maxim, 

"He who by the plough would thrive, 
 Himself must either hold or drive." 

Although it seems a paradox, yet ho will find that the art 
 of draining has at last been applied, as well to dry lands to 
 induce moisture, as it was at first supposed to be beneficial 
 only to such as are wot. He must also establish such rules 
 of discipline .as will be most profitable, and by which his e- 
 conomy is regulated. If it takes more than 5 lbs. of corn 
 meal to make 1 pound of beef, or 3i lbs, to make 1 pound of 
 pork, the cost is greater than the profit. The choice of live 
 stock, their habits and (jualities, require earnest considera- 
 tion. The Devon or Jliddle horned cattle, esseatiallj- tho 
 same, with those of Sussex, Wales and Scotland, are deemed 
 to be the native breeds of Great Britian. Time and care 
 have brought them to such perfection, that they are standard 
 models throughout the world. Our common stock origina- 
 ted from thence, and may, by sirailar care, add greatly to 
 the value of domestic herds. Choose, for instance, from 
 your alpine districts the best cow that can be found, and 
 place her in the pastures of your vallies ; assume as a guide 
 to her selection that seven quarts of milk make 1 quart of 
 cream, or 21 lbs. of milk produce 1 lb. of butter, and you 
 will then have good ground upon which to base your most 
 sanguine endeavors. The supply of food, and the best form 
 in which it is given, are of primary consideration, and it is 
 scarcely necessary to add, that poor stock well attended 
 may excel the best that is neglected. From wool culture in 
 this part of Pennsylvania but little profit can bo realized. 
 It takes one ton of hay to make 14 1))S. of wool, in addition 
 to which the losses from disease and accidents are numerous, 
 because of all animals, the sheep is the most defenceless 
 and inoffensive. Sheep require clean ranges, that tho wool 
 may not be disturbed by tlie undergrowth and thicket. In 
 Schuylkill County such ranges are rare, but all the U(mD- 
 tainous and uncleared portions, would be well adapted to 
 tho rearing of that mo.st despised animal, the goat. It is so 
 singularly constituted, that it prefers the neglected wild to 
 the most cultivated fields, and delights in browsing upon
