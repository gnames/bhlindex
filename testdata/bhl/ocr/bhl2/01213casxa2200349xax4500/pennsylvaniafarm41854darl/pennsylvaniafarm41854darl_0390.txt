lie is now engaged in constructing and erecting rams 
 of a large size on the plan exhibited in the above draw- 
 ing. One of these, weighing over 1500 pounds, is de- 
 signed to raise water for the town of Aledia. This ram 
 will operate under 26 feet head, the water will be raised 
 182 feet high, and will raise over 36,000 gallons in 24 
 hours, when the sti-eam furnishes 2-50 gallons per min- 
 ute.

Barn- Yard Manure. 

Before another issue of our paper, the yarding of 
 stock, or putting them into their regular winter quar- 
 ters, will have been accomplished. We presume at least 
 no reader of the Farm Journal is so far behind the times 
 as to leave his stock exposed to the severities and 
 changes of the winter, unsheltered and unprotected. If 
 there are any such, of course what we now have to say 
 about the proper management and care of the manure 
 heap will not be attended to by them. Barn-yards are 
 yet emptj', and before they are occupied by the stock it 
 is all important that the necessary arrangements should 
 be made for securing the full benefit of the collections 
 and droppings of the winter months. There is no branch 
 of our present farm management so erroneous, so di- 
 rectly, positively and unnecessarily wasteful and apposed 
 to all true theory, as well as plain common sense, as 
 the common practice, in this particular, even of those 
 considered our best farmers. What is the ordinary 
 shape of three-fourths at least of our barn-yards ? Why 
 simply an inclined plane, or gentle slope, so as to make 
 it certain that all the drainings and liquid droppings may 
 be carried safely away, and which contain the very es- 
 sence and virtue of the manure. Is this much more ra- 
 tional that the not unusual practice in some parts of 
 the west, where barn-yards are located convenient to a 
 stream with the ver}/ object of relieving the former of his 
 manure with the least trouble. 

One hundred and fifty dollars now judiciously laid 
 out in pre,%ermng the contents of the yard for the next 
 five or six months, will, we think, be more than repaid 
 back the coming season, and be a clear gain each year 
 afterwards. Without now going much into the chemistry 
 of the subject, we would only refresh the memories of 
 our readers, by stating that animal manures soon after 
 being dropped commence passing off into the atmosphere 
 their most volatile and valuable ingredients, and that by 
 this process, and by leaching during the rains and snows 
 of winter, pi-obably three-fourths of their real value is 
 forever lost to the land. These should be saved by the 
 use of proper absorbents, and by covering or shelter. Ev- 
 ery barn-yard should be made somewhat in the shape of 
 a plate, elevated around the edge, so that every thing 
 would drain towards the centre, in which a shed of 
 rough boards of the necessary width for the pui-pose 
 should extend the whole length. We would leave it open 
 on all sides but one, so that the stock might go under it 
 if they chose. Under this shed we would have shovelled 
 every day all the droppings of the yard, and the con- 
 tents of the stalls wheeled out every morning and spread 

evenly over. At least once a week, or twice a week if 
 practicable, an equal bulk of soil from the headlands, 
 cleanings of the ditches, swamps, or washings of the 
 road, should be composted with it in alternate layers, 
 having previously applied a sprinkling of plaster. At one 
 end of the heap, which should be made with a slight in- 
 clination, a hole should be dug large enough to hold 
 any drainage which might escape, and which, by a sim- 
 ple chain pump, should be pumped up anu distributed 
 evenly over it. The manure shed would now soon be 
 found a convenient repository for all wastage from the 
 house, leached ashes, &c., and the augmentation of the 
 heap both in quantity and quality, from this source, 
 would be very great. When there is once a place for 
 any thing, it is often surprising how easily things before 
 lost find their way there. Now by the above simple 
 plan, not involving over $150, the bulk of manure is not 
 only doubled, but the strength and value to the land of 
 the ivhole mass is, we think, double that of the ordinary 
 barn-yard manure carried out in the fall for the wheat 
 crop, and which has been exposed to .all the rains of 
 winter and hot sun of summer. Such attention to the 
 manure heap, while it might require additional labor, 
 would be found to pay, as it augments to the farmer 
 what is equivalent to the gold heap of the miner â€” the 
 raw material which supplies the means of obtaining 
 whatever wealth may purchase. There is a great simi- 
 larity in the two heaps, as they are neither of them, in 
 themselves, any thing which can be used, other than as 
 a medium for attainment. We hope our hints may not 
 pass away unheeded, but be acted upon at once. 

Shelter for Stock. 

So much has been said and written upon this subject 
 as to create, with some very careful and anxious far- 
 mers, a kind of nervousness about it, which in cases 
 within our knowledge has impelled them into the oppo- 
 site extreme from what was intended. 

Stock should not be exposed during winter to the in- 
 clemencies and changes of the weather, without a chance 
 of sheltering themselves under a shed, or in a stable ; 
 but they do not require to be constantly confined in 
 the warm and vitiated atmosphere of our ordinary barns 
 and stables. Nature has provided animals in their warm 
 skins, and abundant covering of hair, with sufficient 
 protection against cold if they are well fed. The com- 
 bustion and chemical changes in the stomach, during 
 digestion and assimilation, create sufficient heat with 
 their natural covering to protect against any ordinary 
 cold weather. We do not believe they suffer from sim- 
 ple cold if they are in health. It is the sudden changes 
 of weather, the continvied rains and snows, the deep 
 barn-yards, often up to their knees in mud and manure, 
 and the scarcity and difficulty of obtaining pure water, 
 which cause cattle to fall away, or stop thriving during 
 the winter season. Under a false impression that stock 
 should be kept warm artificially, we have known thirty 
 and foi'ty head to be confined in contiguous stalls eigh- 
 teen or twenty hours out of the twenty-four, in stables 
 with low ceilings, where there was no ventilation, out- 
 side doors shut, and the air poisoned with carbonic acid 
 and the putrid exhalations from their droppings: a state 
 of things sure to make them tender and unhealthy, and
