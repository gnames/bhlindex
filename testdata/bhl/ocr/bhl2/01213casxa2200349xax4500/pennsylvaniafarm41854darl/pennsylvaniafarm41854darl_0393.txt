of the largest size. Remove the little bones, skin, &c., 
 from about the root, and trim it nicely. Take a table- 
 spoonful each of salt, pepper, and powdered cloves, and 
 mix them all together. Rub the tongue well all over 
 with this seasoning. Lay it in a deep earthen pan, cov- 
 er it with the best cider vinegar, and let it stand three 
 days, turning it frequently, and keeping it closely cover- 
 ed. Then (having wiped ofiF all the seasoning) put the 
 tongue into a stew-pot, and add half a pint of water — 
 not more — and stew it slowly till quite done. Have 
 ready some force-meat balls, made with minced veal, 
 mixed with the ingredients usual in force-meat. Put in 
 the balls about twenty minutes before you take up the 
 tongue. When it is thoroughly done, and tender all 
 throxigb, peel it, and send it to table with the force-meat 
 balls round it. 

Curing Pork. — A correspondent of the American 
 Farmer gives the following method of curing pork : — 
 Place tiers of shelves two and a half feet apart on three 
 sides of your smoke-house, making their bottoms of 
 strips three inches wide instead of wide planks, so that 
 air may be admitted to the bottom as well as the sides 
 and top of the pork. In packing down, place a row of 
 middlings first on the shelf, next one of shoulders, and 
 lastly, the hams on the top. This is as much as I ever 
 put on one tier of shelves. Proceed in like manner till 
 the whole is packed. Use five pecks of salt in the 1000 
 lbs. if the hogs are lai'ge, and if small, one bushel to the 
 thousand will answer ; mix equal parts of powdered salt- 
 petre and red pepper, and apply a table-spoonful to each 
 of the joints before the salt is put on ; but if the pork is 
 small, half that quantity will be sufficient. If the 
 weather is moderate, six weeks will be long enough for 
 it to remain in salt ; if very cold, let it stand two weeks 
 longer. 

When the time an'ives for hanging up, sift some clean 
 hickory ashes, and after having put the strings into the 
 joints, brush or wipe oif the salt, (never wash,) and ap- 
 ply a coating of fresh ashes to the flesh side of each 
 piece, and hang up carefully; the middlings need no 
 ashes — let it hang three or four days, and dry before 
 you begin to smoke. After that, make one smoke a day 
 only for ten or twelve days. In the month of March 
 take down your joint,*, and put them into bags made of 
 thin cotton cloth, carefully tying each bag around the 
 string by which the pieces of meat were hung up. Hang 
 up again and let it remain till wanted for use. 

Curing Hams — To everylO 00 lbs. of hams, take eight 
 ounces of saltpetre, two quarts of molasses, and two 
 quarts salt; mix with water. After settling for two or 
 three hours before introducing the hams, rack off, and 
 throw out the sediment from the bottom; cover the meat 
 with the brine, and repack once a week, changing the 
 position of the hams. In six weeks, the hams may be 
 taken to the smoke room. After smoking, they may be 
 returned to the brine, and kept through the summer. 
 If preferable the meat may remain in the briue, and be 
 taken out and smoked as it is required for use. It will 
 be found always in excellent condition, and is, when 
 smoked, an excellent article. — Ger. Tel. 

Straightening a Colt's Tail. 
 A correspondent of the Boston Cultivator, who had a 

very fine colt that carried its tail to one side, and was 
 continually throwing it over the driving lines, says he 
 cured him of this habit by braiding a loop in his tail 
 and tying it with a string to the trace on the same side 
 on which he carried it, and when he found it was tied, 
 he would pull on it, when I would let him up a little 
 gradually on the string, until at length he came to carry 
 his tail perfectly straight. 

This remedy is something like we frequently see boys 
 apply to stubborn hogs, by pulling the tail in a direction 
 contrary to the one they desire the animal to move. 

The Curculio. 

A correspondent of the American Fai-mer gives the 
 following as his experience in the use of wrappings of 
 "cotton laps" as a remedy for the curculio. If any of 
 our friends have hid any experience in this matter we 
 shall be happy to hear from them : 

"Some time since I saw in the Maine Farmer a reme- 
 dy for the curculio, which I tested at the time with un- 
 expected success. It consisted of three bands of cotton 
 fastened around the tree at intervals of about one foot. 
 It did not prove to be a perfect security against that 
 pest of all plum trees, but enabled me to save the great- 
 er part of my plums, and encouraged me to do a little 
 something to renovate my trees, which, since the appear- 
 ance of the curculio had been growing in sward land. 
 Accordingly I dug up the ground around them, and re- 
 moved the turf from all save one to tlie hog pen. From 
 that tree I gathered about one peck of plums infected 
 with the bug, also a bushel of sound fruit, (it being a 
 small tree,) while from the others the fruit was all 
 sound. I allowed the cotton to remain on the trees the 
 year round, taking no trouble to renew or repair it after 
 it was put on. I am now nearly rid of the "ciitter;" 
 indeed, I have not been able to find one upon my trees 
 this season. And when examining the cotton have found 
 but three eggs. 

The trees look finely, and are already bending under 
 their burden of fruit. If, in any case, cotton has failed 
 to protect any body's plums, I am persuaded it, is be- 
 cause they have been too stingy of it. 

The best way is to buy batting and split it in two sev- 
 eral times, then cut into stripes three or four inches 
 wide and wind around the trunk of the tree, twice at 
 least, and tie with a piece of twine on the upper edge. 
 Three bands at least should always be used, and more 
 would be better, unless the land is in grass, in whicli 
 case the sods can be removed, together with the larva;, 
 which spend the winter in the earth directly under the 
 ti-ee." 

A Glance at Fennsylvanians and their Farming. 

Our friend M. B. Bateham, Esq., of the Ohio Cultivator, 
 who recently attended our State Fair, gives the following 
 sketch of "Pennsylvanians and their farming:" 

In passing through the State of Peimsjdvania from 
 Pittsburgh to Philadelphia by railroad, the first half of 
 the distance is mostly through a \\\\\y or mountainous 
 country, presenting a good deal of wild and romantic 
 scenery but not much chance for cultivation. The other 
 half of the route, from the vicinity of Harrisburg to 
 Philadelphia, on the other hand passes through one of the
