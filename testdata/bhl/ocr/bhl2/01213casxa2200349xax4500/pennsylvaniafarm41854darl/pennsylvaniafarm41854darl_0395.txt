rider over a five barred gate, with ease; but he thought 
 the horse did not carry as good a tail as he wished, — he 
 therefore had him nicked and when the horse got well 
 he could scarcely carry him over two bars. "Thus," said 
 he, "I have spoiled a fine horse; and no wonder for it 
 \veakened him in his loins." Any man of common sense 
 would give ten per cent, moi'e for a fine horse whose tail 
 had never been mutilated, than for one which had been 
 under the hand of a jocke}'. 

Milch Cows. 

The editor of the New England Farmer justly remarks: 
 "If you desire your cows to yield liberally to the pail, 
 you must feed them with something better suited to the 
 secretion of rich milk than dry provender- Chopped 
 roots, or meal slops of some kind, should be given tliem 
 twice a day, at least, say morning and evening. Tlicy 
 should also be provided with littered beds, dry lodgings 
 ■ — moderately warm — be regularly watered thrice each 
 day, just before being fed, — be curried or combed once 
 a day, and salt, with occasionly a little ashes or fine bone 
 dust mixed, two or three times a week. They also like 
 a variety of food. Roots, cut or rasped, and mixed with 
 cut hay or straw, then stirred and left for an hour or 
 two, make a mess which tliey will eat very gi-eedily. 
 Me think that hardly attention enough is given to the 
 bedding of cows, as the more quiet and comfortable they 
 lire, the less food will be required to sustain the .system, 
 and may therefore go to produce flesh or milk. A gentle- 
 man who has employed several pairs of working oxen for 
 many year.;, states that oxen will travel fifteen miles a 
 day, being well "littered down" at night, as easy as 
 twelve miles, and lie upon the bai'e floor. If this state- 
 ment be correct — and it seems to us consistent — it is a 
 pretty important matter that all our cattle are well pro- 
 vided for in this respect." 

Mode of Using Guano. 

Many farmers, not accustomed to the use of guano, 
 rely on the statements of the vendor, or of a neighbor, 
 or any other person who will give advice as to the best 
 method of using it, the best articles to mix with it, &c.; 
 and not unfrequently are led into very grave errors, 
 which a little reflection would have caused them to 
 avoid. The advice of no man should be followed when 
 it is contrary to the uniform result of scientific experi- 
 ments, or to common sen.se. No constant reader of the 
 Farm Journal would ever be guilty of mixing guano 
 with a class of materials only calculated to set fiee its 
 ammonia. But as some of our new subscribers ma}- not 
 be posted on this subject, we append an extract from a 
 communication by Prof. Benj. Ilallowell to the Virginia 
 Sentinel. He s.ays : 

"I may state, that it is entirely opposed to chemical 
 principles to mix live-ashes, or quick-lime, with any an- 
 im.al manure. Ammonia, the chief valuable ciiai-acter- 
 istic ingredient of animal manures, is usuallj' found in 
 these manures in combination with some organic acids,, 
 and these acids, owing to the generally stronger affinity, 
 unite with potash and lime when they are present, and 
 liberate the ammonia, thus rendering the manure of 
 much less value. 

♦'But this is not the only injury. The liberated am- 

monia unites with the acids in the soil, as the humic, 
 crenic and apo-crenic acids which are almost insoluble, 
 and forms compounds readily dissolved and washed from 
 the soil by the rains, greatly depriving it of those con- 
 stituents upon which its fertility chiefly depends. 

"It is the deteriorating efi"ect arising from the escape 
 of the ammonia, and the soluble compounds it forms 
 with the organic acids in the soils, that indicate the pro- 
 priety of mixing plaster with guano to "fix" the ammo- 
 nia, previous to sowing it on the land. The first crop 
 ma?/ be none the better thereby, and, in some rare in- 
 stances, possibly not quite so good; but the land will al- 
 ways be in a state more favorable to the growth of sub- 
 sequent crops. 

"I will take this occasion to repeat, that I regard the 
 discovery of guano, and its introduction into our coun- 
 try, as a great blessing, by increasing the fertility of our 
 soils, and aftbrding the means of improving many lands, 
 otherwise in a state of hopeless sterility. But we must 
 not depend upon the use of this, as the settled policy of 
 farming, to the neglect of our home manures. It is op- 
 posed to every principle of political economy to send as 
 far as half the circuit of our globe for guano, and ne- 
 glect equally, or even more valuable manures, on our 
 very premises, and in our neighboring cities." 

Experiments with Carrots in Feeding Milch Cows. 

Abner Haven communicates the following experiment 
 on the value of carrots as food for milch cows to the 
 Wool Grower: 

"I have tried feeding carrots to milch cows, and will 
 give you one of my experiments. I have (April 1.5th) 
 seven cows in milk — one calved in .June, the rest in 
 September and Octol)er. I raised 80 bushels ruta bagas 
 and 400 bushels carrots, and fed them to my cows, com- 
 mencing the first of December. I gave them about 2^ 
 bushels per day, at noon, the ruta bagas first, and when 
 they were all fed out, the same quantity of carrots. [ 
 found, when I had fed the latter a few days, that my 
 cows were each giving from two to three pints of milk 
 more per diiy than when fed on ruta bagas. I was feed- 
 ing my cows, meanwhile, with cut hay, and 2 lbs. oil 
 cake meal, and 2J lbs. wheat screenings, ground. 

"The thought struck me that I should like to know 
 the value of carrots for making milk, so I selected the 
 cow that calved last for the trial. I weighed the hay, 
 meal and carrots, and fed per day 27 lbs. of h.iy, 4J lbs. 
 of the mixed meal, and 22 lbs. of carrots, and she gave 
 r>5 lbs. of milk per day. I then left off" the carrots, and 
 gave the same amount of meal, and all the hay she 
 would cat, which was .3.3 lbs. per day. After feeding so 
 for a week, I found she gave 23 fts. of milk per day. 
 I then gave her the carrots as before, and in eight or 
 ten days she came up again to ."35 lbs. of milk per day. 

"This sliows tliat carrots are worth to mc to feed to 
 cows 82 cents per 100 lbs. Ilay is worth $20 per ton 
 in the barn, and at 3 cents per quart, or 1 cent per lb. 
 for milk, G lbs. less hny, and 12 lbs. more milk gives 18 
 cents for 22 lbs. of carrots." 

Save Your Bones. 
 It is well known that bones are valuable tvs a manure. 
 Instead of being thrown aw.ay by the cook as is usualljr
