the case, they should be collected into a heap, afid cov- 
 ered with wood or coal ashe? and exposed to the i-ain 
 and atmosphere. In a short time they will crumble into 
 powder, when the mass should be worked over, and you 
 have a preparation equal to any of the patent fertilizers 
 extant. Almost every farmer might, with care, make a 
 half ton of this manure, the ingredients of which are 
 now lost. 

Sowing Locust Seed. 

In many parts of the country timber is becoming very 
 deal*, and farmers who have to buy their posts and rails, 
 find it a heavy drain upon their purses. Such being the 
 case it is a matter of surprise that more attention has 
 not been paid to planthig trees suitable for fence timber. 

The yellow locust, it is well known, when planted in 
 rich ground is a rapid grower, and, posts made of it 
 well seasoned will last for a great length of time. The 

American Farmer gives the following directions for plant- 
 ing and replanting: — The ground to be selected should 
 be a deep, well-exposed loam; it should be manured, 
 ploughed deep, harrowed, and the seed sown thinly, in 
 drills two inches deep, four feet apart. Before being 
 sown, the seed should be soaked in warm water for twenty 
 four hours; all the seeds which float to be castaside. The 
 plants, when they come up, must be kept clean. At one 
 and two years old the young trees will be fit to be trans- 
 planted. They should then be set out iu a deep, warm 
 soil, which has Iieen well manured, ploughed, and harrow- 
 ed, in rows twelve feet apart, ten feet asunder in the row 
 which will give to each acre 3G3 trees. In twelve years 
 they will be large enough for posts and we all know that 
 they make durable ones. A gi-ove once set will, after be- 
 ing cut down, renew itself, and furnish a new supply of 
 post timber every twelve or fifteen years. A small 
 grove, therefore, would supply a large farm with posts. 

COLT BREAKER. 

We are indebted to the New England Farmer for the 
 above engrjiving, representing a plan for breaking colts, 
 w'iich we think must commend itself to every reader. 
 Although it "speaks for itself," we append the descrip- 
 tion and experience of the inventor : 

ExPL.\NATiON OF THK DRAWING. — A post Set firm In 
 the ground, and rising three feet, with a shoulder three- 
 inch round tenon or pivot at the top. 

Two straight, rough, hard wood poles, thirty feet long, 
 eight inches in diameter at the butt ends, and four inch- 
 es in diameter at the tops. One of these poles is con- 
 fined on the top of the post, six feet from the butt end, 
 by a round mortice, three and a half inches in diameter. 
 The other pole is lapped into the first, near their butt 
 ends, made fast by locking, and by a two-inch pin. 

The hind wheels of a lumber wagon, fitted on the ends 
 of the poles. 

Crossbar, a rough pole twelve feet long, bolted at 
 each end on the long poles, four feet from the wheel 
 hubs. 

Rough pole, bolted on one of the main poles and on 
 the cross bar, to support the whipple-tree. 

An augur hole bored through the forward pole, in 
 which is fastened a rope for confining the pole strap of 
 the harness. 

"A little more than one year since, having three fine 
 colts that were wholly untutored, I adopted a new ex- 
 pedient for bringing them into subjection, which suc- 
 ceeded to a charm. Several of my neighbors availed 
 themselves of the privilege gratuitously offered them by 
 the use of my apparatus in breaking their colts, and in 
 every case they were delighted with the ease, safety and 
 thorough success of the scheme. Last autumn, having 
 bought another large and vigorous colt of throe years 
 past in age, and wishing to bring it under subjection, I 
 resorted to the same method that was found so effectual 
 last season, which has been equally satisfactory, both to 
 myself and my neighbors, who have either availed them- 
 selves of the use of the apparatus, or have witnessed its 
 operation ; and in compliance with their suggestion, I
