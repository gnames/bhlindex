ing in the woods of Clion, France, by a French curate, 
 whence its name. It is not of the first quality, but pro- 
 nounced "very good," by the National Pomological Con- 
 gress. Its fine size, great productiveness and hardiness, 
 either on pear or quince, will however make it a desir- 
 able vai'iety, especially as a market fruit. Occasionally 
 in some soils and localities it is found of fine flavor, 
 but rather astringent. 

Shape, long pyriform, a little one sided, skin, fair and 
 smooth, pale yellow sometimes with a brownish cheek, 
 and brown dots. Cahjz large, open, in a basin slightly 
 swTiV; Jlcsh, greenish white juicy sprightily and sometimes 
 bitter, November to January.

Will Acorns Kill Cattle 1 

It may seem superfluous to ask this question, at this 
 day, in a country where cattle have had more or less ac- 
 cess to them every fall for a hundred and fifty years, yet 
 we put it in all seriousness, and ask any of our readers 
 having a knowledge of the subject to communicate to us. 
 Our reason for making the inquiry is to ascertain, if poss- 
 ible, the truth. We are prompted to it at this time by the 
 fact, that Mr. Richard Lamborn, a highly respectable 
 farmer residing a few miles from this place, recently lost 
 fourteen head — seven oxen, four cows, and three steers — 
 under peculiar circumstances; and the concurrent opini- 
 on of himself, his neighbors, and neighboring physicians 
 who took an interest in the subject is, that they were 
 killed by eating excessively of acorns. 

The facts of the case are substantially these. One of 
 Mr. Lamborn's pasture fields contains a grove of about 
 four acres of timber principally white, black, and chesnut 
 oaks. 

Tliese oaks, produced the present season a very heavy 
 crop of acorns. His cattle were pasturing in the field 
 containing this grove, during September and the early 
 part of October, and eat of them freely. About the 25th 
 of September one of his best oxen died; soon after another 
 was observed to be unwell, and very heavy doses of purgi- 
 tive medcines were administered, but without effect; and 
 in less than a week from the first appearance of disease, 
 the animal died. Another and another followed, \iiitil 

Mr. Lamborn became alarmed, and set about learning the 
 cause in earnest. 

A neighboring physician carefully examined the stom- 
 ach and intestines of the dead animals, but no trace of poi- 
 son or its eff"ects were found. The "melt" was somewhat 
 enlarged, also the gall bladder, and the contents of the latter 
 were much thicker than in health. The stomach and in- 
 testines had the appearance of suffering from powerful as- 
 tringents. Considerable quantities of acorns were found 
 in the stomach, and as these were known to be powerful 
 astringents, and reasoning from effect to cause, the opin- 
 ion prevailed, that the acorns were the probable cause 
 of death. 

Mr. Lamborn informs us that the veins of the carcas- 
 es appeared almost bloodless — similar to those of a well 
 stuck bullock — and that the cows failed of their milk 
 suddenly, falling oflf from a gallon to a pint in a single 
 night. 

The first indications the animals gave of being amiss 
 were Avatering at the eyes, drooping the head, and spirit- 
 less walk. Although many remedies were applied none 
 were successful. The animals did not appear to be suff- 
 ering any pain; they eat for several days after the first 
 appearance of the disease, but invariably died in a week 
 from the first attack. 

So fond were the cattle of the acorns, that as soon as 
 put into the field in the morning, they would scamper off 
 to the grove and remain there most of the day. The 
 ground is yet almost covered with the "cups" and hulls 
 of the acorns eaten by the stock. 

We need scarcely say that as soon as it was suspected 
 that the acorns were the cause of the disease, the remain- 
 ing cattle were put in another field, and we may add, 
 that none have died, which were not sick at the time this 
 change was made. 

We have heard of one or two other farmers losing 
 stock from a similar disease recently but have learned no 
 particulars. We have also heard that there are parts of 
 the country where acorns are esteemed injurious to cattle, 
 but such has not been the opinion in this section. 

Vine Culture. 

As considerable districts in Pennsylvania, Delaware 
 and New Jersey, are adapted to the growth of the grape, 
 and as this fruit will always find a ready sale at large 
 prices in the cities and large towns, we have condensed 
 from an excellent little work by Robert Buchanan, his 
 statement of the cost of planting a vineyard of six acres, 
 the expenses of its culture, and probable yield. 

1st Cost of a vineyard of six acres, containing four- 
 teen thousand four hundred vines : 

Trenching two feet deep, $05 per acre, $390 

Sodding avenues, 60 

Cost of 30,000 cuttings, af $2 50 per thousand,.... 75 

Planting, 70 

Fourteen thousand five hundred locust stakes, at $3 

per hundred, 436 

Setting 14,500 stakes, 65 

$1,085 
 The vineyard being on a gentle declivity did not re- 
 quire benching, which would have been more expensive 
 than the draining by sodded avenues — nor did the
