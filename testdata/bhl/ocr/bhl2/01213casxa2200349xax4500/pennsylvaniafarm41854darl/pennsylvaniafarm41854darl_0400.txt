gfouiul contain stone enough to add to the expense of 
 trenching, which, in some positions, is a very serious 
 item. 

By proper economy, a man may have a vineyard of 
 several acres in a few years, without feeling the expense 
 to be burdensome. Commence by trenching one acre in 
 the winter, and planting it out in the spring ; next year 
 another acre, and so on for five or six years. After the 
 third year, he will have his own cuttings from the first 
 acre, and also grapes enough to pay for the cost of plant- 
 ing the succeeding additions to his vineyard. 

2d. Cost of attending a vineyard : 
 Cost of attending the first year — vine-dresser $216, 
 and a hand for one month, $15 (and board them- 
 selves), $231 

Second year — vine-dresser, $216, a hand for two 

mouths, at $15 per month, 256 

Cuttings, after first year, to replace failures, say,... 20 

Hauling, carting, etc., 68 

Contingencies, etc., 150 

Total cost for attending in first and second years, $725 

3d. After culture : 

To the proprietor or the tenant who is his own vine- 
 dresser, this will be small, especially if he has a family 
 that can assist him ; but to those who have to hire every 
 hand, the following statement will be found pretty accu- 
 rate. For a vineyard of six acres — 

Vine-dresser per year, and board himself, $240 

Hands to assist in pruning, say, 25 

" " " spring culture, 40 

" " " summer culture, 55 

Or $60 per acre, 
 If tlie cuttings can be sold at $2 to $2 50 per thou- 
 sand, it will reduce this about $100. 

4th. Probable product of an acre per annum : 
 This of course will vary with the season, and with the 
 number of vines to the acre. 

At the distance of 3 by 6 feet 2,420 vines are planted 
 in an acre. They will yield, in fair seasons, 75 to 100 
 bushels ; in very good years more. A probable average 
 for eight or ten years, with but little rot, would be about 
 65 bushels — and with a reasonable allowance for rot, 
 frost, &c., 50 bushels might be expected as a fair pro- 
 duct per acre for a series of years. This is also Mr. 
 Longworth's opinion. But even then, bad seasons must 
 not be too frequent, or the average will be still further 
 reduced. In the report of Dr. Flagg, May, 1846, he 
 makes the yield per acre, for 1845, about 50 bushels, 
 and the vineyards suffered much from frost and the rot 
 that year. 

The grapes will sell readily in market at from three to 
 four dollars a bushel. 

Gas Tar in Horticulture. 

A discovery which is likely to be of great advantage to 
 agriculture, has just been reported to the Agricultural 
 Society at Clermont (Oise.) A gardener whose frames 
 and hot-houses required painting, decided on making 
 them black, as likely to attract the heat better, and from 
 principal of economy he made use of gas tar instead of 
 black paint. The work was performed during the winter. 

and on the .approach of spring the gardener was surprised 
 to find that all the spiders and insects which usually in- 
 fested his hot-house had disappeared, and also that a vine 
 which for the last two years had so fallen off that he had 
 intended to replace it by another, had acquired fresh 
 force and vigor and gave every sign of producing a large 
 crop of grapes. He afterwards used the same substance 
 to the posts and trellis-works which supported the trees 
 in the open air, and met with the same result, all the cat- 
 erpillars and other insect completely disappearing. It 
 is said that similar experiments have been made in some 
 of the vineyards of the Gironde with similar results. —

To Make Hens Lay Pepetaally. 

Keep no roosters; give the hens fresh meat chopped up 
 like sausage meat, once a day — a very small portion, 
 say half an oimce a day to each hen in winter, or from 
 the time insects disappear in the fall till they appear 
 again in the spring. Never allow any eggs to remain in 
 the nest for what are called nest eggs. When the roos- 
 ters do not run with the hens, and no nest eggs are left 
 in the nest, the hens will not cease laying after the pro- 
 duction of twelve or fifteen eggs, as they always do when 
 roosters are allowed, but continue laying perpetually. 
 If the above plan were generally adopted, eggs would be 
 as plentiful in winter as in summer. One reason why 
 hens do not lay in winter as freely as in summer is the 
 want of animal food which they get in summer in abun- 
 dance in the form of insects. When the ground is cov- 
 ered with snow give them access to lime and pebbles, 
 from which the egg shell is formed. 

Solidified Milk. v 

The last number of the American Medical Monthly con- 
 tains an account of a visit made by a committee of med- 
 ical gentlemen, appointed by the New York Academy of 
 Medicine, to the establishment of Mr. Blatchford, at Ai-- 
 menia, some thirty miles east of Poughkeepsie, where 
 solidified milk is prepared. The editor describes the 
 process of solidification as follows: — To 112 lbs. of milk, 
 28 lbs. of Stuart's white sugar were added, and a trivial 
 proportion of bicarbonate of soda, a teaspoonful, merely 
 enough to insure the neutralizing of any acidity, which 
 in the summer season is exhibited even a few minutes 
 after milking, although inappreciable to the organs of 
 taste. The sweet milk was poured into evaporating 
 pans of enamelled iron, imbedded in warm water heated 
 by steam. A thermometer was immersed in each of 
 these water baths, that, by frequent inspection, the tem- 
 perature might not rise above the point which years of 
 experience shown advisable. 

To facilitate the evaporation, by means of blowers and 
 other ingenious apparatus, a current of air is established 
 between the covers of the pans, and the solidifying milk. 
 Connected with the steam engine is an arrangement for 
 stirrers, for agitating the milk slightly while evaporating 
 and so gently as not to churn it. In about three hours 
 the milk assumed a pasty consistency, and delighted the 
 palates of all present. By constantly manipulating and 
 warming, it was reduced to a rich creamy-looking pow- 
 der; then exposed to the air to cool, weighed into parcels 
 of a pound each, and by a press, with the force of a
