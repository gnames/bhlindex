It was tested and compared with the Isabella, at Boston, 
 grown at Weston, not far from Concord ; and not one on 
 the Committee considered it as good. We have again 
 compared it with Isabella grown here, and the latter has 
 been iinanimously pronounced superior. 

"Yet we regard the grape as an important acquisition, 
 as ripening earlier than either the Catawba or Isabella, 
 and therefore likely to furnish northern sections with a 
 grape, where heretofore no good grapes have ripened. 
 It may be two weeks earlier than the Isabella, but not 
 more, we think ; for ripe Isabellas, fiilly ripe and excel- 
 lent, gi'own within ten miles or less of Concord, were 
 shown beside it at Boston. The location, however, must 
 have been a very favorable one; for most people seemed 
 surprised to see it ripe so early, and some, Mr. Hovey 
 included, asserted very positively that they were not 
 Isabellas but veritable Concords. IMr. Hovey adhered to 
 this opinion, we believe, until he went to Weston and 
 examined the vine from Avhich the Isabellas were gather- 
 ed. From this one would suppose that there is a great 
 similarity between the two grapes ; and so there is ; but 
 the form and flavor are botli different^ as we have al- 
 ready said, and the canes of the Concord are much more 
 slender than those of the Isabella. 

"We believe the merits of this grape have been exag- 
 gerated. It has been described as being "free from all 
 pulj}," and of a very rich and luscious flavor. Mr. Bull 
 himself, however, described it as having "very little 
 pulp," which is nearer the truth. We think it will, with 
 the same treatment, be about the size of the Isabella. 
 It appears to have a vigorous constitution, likely to es- 
 cape mildew and other diseases to a great extent ; and 
 this is a very important quality. On the whole, we con- 
 gratulate Mr. Bull on his successful attempt at raising 
 seedling grapes ; it affords him ample encouragement to 
 continue his labors in this direction."

 Barn Building. 

In Pennsylvania there is no complete farm without a 
 barn, and the plan of construction is almost uniform. 
 A bank-barn is deemed an indispensable necessity. 
 The immense amount of money thus invested, and the 
 proportion which it bears to the value of the land itself, 
 is very satisfactory evidence of its practical value. Not- 
 withstanding the impression that exists in other States 
 on this subject, in my judgment, there can be no good 
 and profitable farming without it. The subject has, 
 therefore, sufHcient importance to warrant the consider- 
 ation, whether this plan, so uniform, has not been im- 
 proved upon. 

There can be no doubt of the great superiority of the 
 two storied bank-barn. That plan of structure which 
 will most conveniently economise time and labor will best 
 promote the farmer's interests. Having one of each 
 kind, experience has shown me the great superiority of 
 that which I recommend. The difference between them 
 cannot be better expressed than by saying that the im- 
 proved barn has two sets of floors, one above the other ; 
 and as you drive into the upper one, it, of course, re- 
 quires a corresponding height of natural bank— not so 
 high, however, as may not be had on most farms of rolling 
 land. The upper floors have an elevation of seven feet 

above the lower. The advantage of such a barn is, first, 
 its great capacity. It has a height and depth of twen- 
 ty-six feet, without any high pitching ; for your load is 
 about the middle of it, and you pitch both down and up 
 — down to the bottom of the mow, which is on a level 
 with the lower floor, and up to the height of an ordinary 
 barn. But the particular value of this is, the immense 
 compression which results from a high and deep mow — 
 the grain or hay is pressed into a space which is almost 
 inci-edible to any one who has not experienced it. After 
 filling the mow nearly full, you are led to wonder at its 
 capacity to receive more. I need only add, that all oth- 
 er parts of the barn are improved in their convenience 
 and space by this simple alteration in principle ; — that 
 the size of your barn is made to consist in its height 
 instead of its length and breadth, whereby you save, in 
 point of expense, the extensive roofing, and add nothing 
 to your heighth of wall, which you do not take from its 
 length and breadth ; and what you gain is, the value of 
 pressure in packing away, and the saving of labor, in 
 requiring but one or two hands to put your grain in a 
 small mow, when two or three, or perhaps four, would 
 be required in one of greater space. 

But this is but one point of convenience and economy. 
 To thresh grain with a machine requires four, five or 
 six hands — the number depending upon the convenience 
 of putting away the straw. It is easy to perceive the 
 difference in putting away straw in mows and overshots 
 seven feet below the threshing floor, and in those on a 
 level with it. And soon after you begin to get out your 
 grain this state of the case arises, and it will be found 
 that one or two hands less are required. 

The capacity of the common bank-barn will allow you 
 to thresh from one hundred to one hundred and fifty 
 bushels at a time, and then you must stop, discharge 
 your hands, and occupy the next day or two in cleaning 
 up and getting your grain out of the way , whereas in 
 the improved barn the threshed grain passes to the low- 
 er floor, is not in your way, and you thresh on untU you 
 are done. And in a bai'n thus constructed more than 
 double the quantity can be thi'eshed in a day. In the 
 common barn, with the machine I use, it requires about 
 twenty-two minutes to run through ten dozen, and twen- 
 ty-seven minutes to cave it up ; in the improved one all 
 the time of caving up, being more than one-half, is saved. 
 The same machine, which wUl thresh one hundred bush- 
 els a day in the former, with one hand less will thresh 
 two hundred bushels in the latter. One of the lower 
 floors is used for cleaning your grain, and the other for 
 gamers ; and both constantly useful for many other pur- 
 poses. 

I commend to farmers the examination of this im- 
 provement before they build a barn.

Not being able to procure an oflBcial copy of the proceed-

Pursuant to notice, the session opened on the 13th inst.,

 The attendance was fair, but less numerous than we expect-
