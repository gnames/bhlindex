pected. There were respectable delegations from New 
 York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maine, New Hampshire, 
 and Vermont ; one from Ohio, one from Illinois, one from 
 Iowa, and one from Georgia. 

The President's address was the first business in order, 
 and an excellent, practical address it was. The principal 
 topics discussed in it were — 1st. Raising Fruits from Seed ; 
 2nd. The Arts of cultivation; 3rd. The preservation and 
 ripening of Fruits. 

The nest business in order was the selection of oflficers 
 for the ensuing year. A committee of one from some five 
 or seven States was appointed, and the ofiicers of last year 
 were re-nominated and elected unanimously ; 

Marshall P. Wilder, President. One Vice President 
 ftom each State. II. W. S. Cleveland, Secretary. Thos. 
 P. James, Treasurer. 

A committee was appointed to prepare an order of busi- 
 ness, and reported the following: — First, discussion of the 
 Pear, in tho following order : — 1. Rejection of worthless 
 sorts. 2. Adoption of sorts for general culture. 3. Adop- 
 tion of sorts tliat promise well. 4. Sorts for culture on 
 Quince stock. "When these subjects are closed, the Apple, 
 Plum, Cherry, and other fruits to be taken up. 

Discussion on Fruits: — On tho list of Pears proposed for 
 rejection were the following sorts, which were retained at 
 the suggestion of Mr. Hovey : 

Beurro Adam, Dumortimer of Manning, Duchesso Dumas, 
 Figue do Naples, Flemish Bonchrctien, Hacon's Incompara- 
 ble, March Bergamot, Knight's Monarch, and Styrian. 

The list previously recommended for trial as "promising 
 well" was then taken up, and tho only variety on it deemed 
 worthy of promotion to the list "for general cultivation" 
 was the Manning's Elizabeth — very highly commended by 
 nearly all who have tested it. Brande's St, Germain and 
 Diller were stricken off the list as unworthy, and tho others, 
 after discussion were allowed to remain. The names of 
 A^aa Assene and Duchesse d' Orleans were changed to Van 
 Assche and Beurre St. Nicholas, being tho original names. 

The following varieties were discussed and admitted to 
 the trial as"promising well" : — Beurre Clairgeau, Sheldon, 
 Collins, Adams, Howell, Beurre Superfin, Lawrence, Belle 
 Epine Dumas, aud Walker. 

The President was requested to name a few of the more 
 promising new varieties, and gave tho following: 

Pius IX. Rousselet d' Esperin, Beurre Sterckman, Chas. 
 Van Hoogten, Conto de Flanders, and Theodore Van Mons. 

Mr. Manning added Fondante de Maline. 

The Easter Beurre was introduced and discussed at con- 
 siderable length. Many had succeeded well with it, and 
 others could not ripen it. It sells in the Boston market at 
 $3 to $6 per dozen. 

' The Fondante do Noel, known as "Belle Apres Noel," 
 was well spoken of. Fondante do Noel was suggested by" 
 Mr. Berckjian. as the original and correct name, and was 
 so agreed to. 

Aiyplea. — We were absent during a consiilerablo part of 
 the discussion on Apples. Tho Melon and Ilawley were, we 
 believe, recommended for general cultivation, the Bcnoni 
 for trial, and the Ladies' Sweet was passed as one of tho 
 best winter sweet varieties. Several others were discussed 
 and passed by as not being suflSciently known. 

Cherries. — The following varieties were adopted as prom- 
 ising well : — Belle d' Orleans, Gov. Wood, Black Hawk, 
 Great Bigarreau, Coo's Transparent, Kirtland's M.ary, Ho- 
 vey, Walsh's seedling, known and disseminated by Hovey 
 as the New Black Bigarreau. 

Strawberries. — The discussion was very unsatisfactory. 
 There seemed to be an astonishing difference of opinion in 

regard to the merits of sorts. Burr's New Pino and Jenny's 
 Seedling were recommended for "certain localities." 

Plums. — The following were recommended for general 
 cultivation: — McLaughlin, Smith's Orleans, and Reine 
 Claude de Bavay ; and as promising well, Washington Seed- 
 ling and Monroe. 

Raspberries. — Knevett's Giant was adopted for general 
 cultivation, and tho Orango and the French as promising 
 well. 

Blackberries. — Tho New Rocholle was highly spoken of 
 by those who knew it. Tho Needham White variety gener- 
 ally regarded as worthless. 

No action taken upon Apricots or Nectarines we believe. 

Grapes. — The Diana was recommondod for general culti- 
 ration. The Concord wa-s discussed, but nothing more done 
 in relation to it than to adopt the report of tho committee 
 on seedling fruits. 

AVe found it impossible, in consequence of frequent in- 
 terruptions, to carry out our intention of making a full re- 
 port of tho decision on fruits, but as soon as the official re- 
 port appears we shall correct all errors and make up all de- 
 ficiencies. We know that many will be desirous of learning 
 as soon as possible what tho decisions of tho society were 
 on certain varieties, and wo therefore give an imperfect 
 sketch without delay. 

Pears on Quince Stock. — This part of tho business was 
 up towards the cloie and the following twenty-two varieties 
 were unanimously agreed too, as worthy of being recom- 
 mended for general culivation on that stock: — Duchesse d' 
 Angouleme, Rostiezer, Beurre d' Anjou, Beurro Diel, AVhite 
 Doyenne, Louise Bonne be Jersey, A^icar of AVinkticld, 
 Glout Morceau, Fig Beurre Langlier, Easter Beurre, Pound 
 or Uvedale's St. Germain, Cattillae, Beurre d' Amaulis, 
 Long Green, Noveau Poiteau, Soldat Laborer, Urbaniste, 
 Napoleon, Buffam, St. Michael Archangel, Triomph de Jo- 
 doigne. 

The proceedings throughout were characterized by the 
 utmost caution, carried even to the extreme, as wo think, in 
 many cases, in regard to recommending fruits. This will 
 bo readily seen from the small number agreed to for gen- 
 eral culture, and also from some varieties previousl}' recom- 
 mended having been stricken entirely ofif the lists. This 
 will doubtless commend such decisions as have been made 
 to the public. Tho delegates from abroad go homo well 
 pleased — delighted with the hospitality and kindness of the 
 Boston horticulturists, and greatly instructed and encoura- 
 ged by their skill, enterprize and enthusiasm. 

The exhibition of the Society was grand. A great oval 
 tent on the common, 200 feet long and 100 feet wide, filled 
 with tho finest fruits and flowers. A table through the cen- 
 ter was occupied with flowers and plants. On either side of 
 this were two tables laden with fruits, and around the side 
 a table fir cut flowers, vegetables, &c. In tho evening it 
 was brilliantly lighted with gas, and a band of music played 
 at intervals and gave tho scene additional zest. Tho com- 
 petition for the premium for tho best thirty varieties of 
 Pears, twelve specimrtis of each, brought out a fine display. 
 On each of the four tables there was a collection of thirty 
 varieties from Messrs. AVilder, Walker, Cabot and Hovey. 

The President of the Society, a,s well as tho Committees 
 and members, were unceasing in their attentions to the del- 
 egates from abroad, and when wo say we never spent three 
 more agreeable days than we did among tho Boston gentle- 
 men, we only repeat the unanimous expression of all those 
 from this and other states. 

In two years from this time tho society is to meet at Ro- 
 chester, and the North-West Pomological Society is invited 
 to meet it there. AVo hope and believe that this general
