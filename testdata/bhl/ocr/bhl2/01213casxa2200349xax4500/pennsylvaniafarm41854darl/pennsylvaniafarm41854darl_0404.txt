THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[December 

assemblage from the east and west will be no less pleasant 
 or profitable than any we have yet seen. The time is dis- 
 tant and great changes may take place ere then, but we 
 shall look forward to it with pleasure nevertheless. 

"National" Cattle Show. 

Wc are indebted to the Ohio Cultivator for the following 
 report of the National Cattle Exhibition, recently held at 
 Springfield, in that State. We regret our inability to add 
 the speeches mode at the banquet. We will publish them 
 in our next: 

The crowd was not so large as to be unwieldy, or very 
 much in each other's way, while it was large enough to in- 
 spire the feeling of social contact. The great feature of the 
 show, of course, was short^horns, though there were several 
 exhibitors — wo can hardly say competitors — in the other 
 departments. Though the show of cattle was by no means 
 so large as that at Newark, the week before, yet it is the 
 general opinion that this, in quality, has not been exceeded 
 by iiny show yet held in the United States. We have no 
 room for detail, indeed comment is unnecessary. Every 
 thing passed off pleasantly, especially the grand banquet on 
 Thursday, for which the local committee deserve unbounded 
 praise, as they have the thanks of many hundreds who were 
 thus enabled to enjoy a double feast of chickens and speech- 
 es. Hon. M. P. Wilder, of Boston, presided at the festival, 
 in which many distinguished guests, besides agriculturists, 
 did themselves the honor to participate. But we cannot 
 speak of individuals, noble fellows as they are. The follow- 
 ing list of awards will indicate the successful competitors. 
 A sweepstakes premium of $500 was competed for, with one 
 bull and five cows each, by Brutus J. Clay, of Kentucky, S. 
 Meredith, of Indiana, A. Watts, Jacob Pierce and W. D. 
 Pierce, of Ohio — but the committee did not decide between 
 the competitors, and no award was made.

Massachusetts Horticultural Society. 
 Some months back the Massachusetts Horticultural 
 Society passed a series of resolutions censuring Mr. C. 
 M. Hovey for having used improper means to obtain the 
 premiums for the Boston Pear and Hovey Cherry. This 
 led to an angry discussion in some of our eastern co- 
 temporaries, and caused considerable excitement both i-n 
 and out of the society, As we published the action of 
 the society in this case at the time, it is proper that we 
 should now state, that at a recent meeting of the society 
 the article of censure was rescinded. 

A Montgomery County Cabbage. 
 Our attention was lately arrested in passing by the 
 agricultural warehouse of Paschall Morris & Co., Phila- 
 delphia, by an enormous cabbage displayed on their 
 counter. It was of the late Drumhead variety, and 
 weighed 21^ pounds. It was raised by Mr. Levi Morris 
 on the Codorus farm, not very far from the Delaware 
 county line, along with several others not much be- 
 hind it in size and weight. Can Chester or any other 
 county beat this cabbage?

Information Wanted. 
 The undersigned has a valuable young mare, which 
 makes a good appearance in harness, excepting an un- 
 fortunate habit she has of thrusting her tongue out of 
 her mouth sideways, as she travels. This habit injures 
 her appear.ance, and it is very desirable to get rid of it. 
 If any of the readers of the Farm Journal can furnish 
 any information that will be of service in remedying the 
 evil, they will confer a favor by forwarding it for inser- 
 tion. W. T.
