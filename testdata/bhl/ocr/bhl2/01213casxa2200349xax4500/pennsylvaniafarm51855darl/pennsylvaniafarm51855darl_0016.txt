been ennui and disgust, and speedy return to city life. 
 Let a locality rather be selected adjacent to a quiet and 
 iatelligent county town — a city in miniature — where 
 all the above and other advantages of good society, li- 
 braries, &c, already exist in addition to frequent and 
 Bpeedy access to the city. 

Secondly, avoid very extensive and costly buildings. 
 These involve more care than comfort, are not at all ne- 
 cessary for the real enjoyment of country life, and how- 
 ever magnificent and imposing they appear, are never- 
 theless often coupled with trouble and perplexity from 
 various causes. 

Thirdly, especially avoid too much land. The mis- 
 take is often made of purchasing a farm, instead of a 
 few acres. In nineteen cases out of twenty, to business 
 men in the cities who move out of town, we would say 
 do not go beyond ten acres, and to a much larger num- 
 ber buy only five. All that you want is a good and con- 
 venient mansion house, with barn and garden on two or 
 three acres of land, reserving the other two for hay and 
 pasturage. Don't encumber yourself with farming, or 
 with the care of any but one man, who could well attend 
 to a vegetable garden, fruit orchard, and all other ne- 
 cessary chores. Farming is a business, as much as 
 storekeeping or the counting house, and requires knowl- 
 edge and experience only to be rightly learned in a prac- 
 tical school. Its details, the purchase and care of 
 implements, stock, manures, securing of crops, their 
 cultivation, all require to be successfully and profitably 
 . attended to — the constant eye and care of the owner of 
 rthe land. They require more attention than any one 
 can give whose business is elsewhere, and there can be 
 .neither pleasure nor profit connected with them where 
 there is the least neglect. 

'Fourthly, don't move into the country permanently 
 unless there is some little taste and preference for it, 
 really and truly, over town life. To those who can 
 hardly exist even in the city without the excitement of 
 the theatre, balls, parties, lectures and panoramas, the 
 singing of birds and other accompaniments of the coun- 
 try will be the dullest kind of music. 

For those removing from town to country, retired 
 from business, of ample means, with whom economy is 
 no object, the expenditure of surplus capital in attrac- 
 tive and beautiful, but not gorgeous, buildings, in laying 
 out and embellishment of parks and pleasure grounds 
 with choice trees, shrubbery and flowers, and in the lux- 
 urious and well furnished orchard and garden, is highly 
 commendable and useful. "We rejoice t© see in the Uni- 
 ted States an increasing tendency to that social life, the 
 charm of English society, typified by the retired "Coun- 
 try Gentleman." How much of real "otium cum digni- 
 tate," how many delightful associations cluster around 
 the word. The town house and country house ! Rural 
 life in England! What is there in all her renown for 
 letters, science, statesmanship, oratory and arms, that is 
 not connected and associated with her rural life ? The 
 traveller, who now seeks for vestiges and memorials of 
 her departed great ones, finds them almost exclusively 
 in the country. The theme is a digestive and copious 
 one, but our limits preclude us from entering on it far- 
 ther. 

The taste for country life in all classes, we repeat, is 

one of the most encouraging features of the times. Not 
 surrounded and hemmed in by water as England, backed 
 up also by illimitable acres clear to the Pacific, tve can 
 well afford to spare land for parks and pleasure grounds 
 and country seats. No paupers will be made by with- 
 holding it from cultivation and production, because there 
 is enough without it. "God made the country and man 
 made the town," and the former, we trust, will continue 
 to have the preference that the natural should always 
 have over the artificial. 

Dry Weather and Deep Plowing. 

The present season of unexampled drouths in various 
 pai'ts of the country have at last awakened farmers to 
 the absolute necessity of deep plowing. The cases brought 
 to our notice have been too numerous to recite here, of 
 full average crops, the result of deep plowing last spring, 
 exactly along side of other crops in contiguous fields 
 hardly worth gathering, the result of shallow, superficial 
 plowing. Occular demonstration is the most convincing, 
 and will satisfy, where mere theory, however sensible, 
 occasions fears and doubts. 

We have urged deep plowing so often in the Farm 
 Journal that it seems almost superfluous repetition. All 
 we want is to induce a fair trial of it one season. The 
 question now occurs, which is the best plow for the pur- 
 pose. While some think sub-soiling, or stirring only the 
 bottom of the furrow, is sufficient, others advocate turn- 
 ing up deep furrows to the surface. This latter has al- 
 ways been our opinion, but we have foreborne to urge it 
 much, knowing that our advice would not be followed. 
 There is among a large majority of farmers an exceed- 
 ing nervousness at the sight of a little yellow clay 
 brought out from the substratum to the surface. It is 
 as much dreaded as the nightmare. TFe say there can 
 be no good farming without a deep soil, and there can 
 be no deep soil (except in places where it exists natural- 
 ly, like alluvial bottoms,) without deep plowing. The 
 more yellow, sterile soil brought to the surface to be 
 meliorated and enriched by atmospheric influences, fer- 
 tilizers, &c, the better, and we have also observed, that 
 where the first breaking up of the sod for corn is not 
 deep, it is very, seldom that depth is attained by subse- 
 quent plowings. It is true the corn crop will not in its 
 early stages grow so fast on this upturned and inferior 
 soil, but a little poudrette, or superphosphate of lime, in 
 the hill, will easily remedy this, and when once fairly 
 started, the roots will push down rapidly to the fertile 
 soil beneath in quest of food and moisture, and soon 
 outstrip that on shallow soil, a fact we have observed 
 repeatedly. 

Our advice is not to break up a field for corn less than 
 ten or twelve inches deep, and there is probably no plow 
 which will do this so easily and so well as the Double 
 Michigan Plow. This, our readers are aware, is a kind 
 of double plow on one beam ; the forward one of small 
 size turning over the sward four or five inches, thus re- 
 lieving the work of the larger plow behind, going seven 
 or eight inches deeper. This is done with the same 
 team, a decided saving in this particular over the com- 
 mon subsoil, and a great economy of draught where 
 deep plowing is the object. For five or six inches in 
 depth only, the Double Michigan offers but little advan-
