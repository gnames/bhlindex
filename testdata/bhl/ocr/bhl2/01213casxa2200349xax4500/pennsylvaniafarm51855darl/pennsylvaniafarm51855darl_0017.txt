tage over the plow generally used in this country. 
 The Double Michigan Plow manufactured by Prouty 
 & Co., of Boston, is the best of its kind, and has at- 
 tracted great attention at exhibitions and plowing 
 matches the past fall by the excellence of its work. It 
 has carried off in several places the first premium over 
 all other plows. It received the first premium at our 
 own State Fair, as well as in several of the counties. 
 Being remarkably strong, well made, and finished in 
 every particular, we commend it to all who believe in 
 deep plowing, and are not afraid of the yellow dirt ; and 
 to those who are, we say, use the subsoil and buy an 
 extra team, but by all means stir up the ground deep 
 with something.

Value of the Field Pea as a Renovator of Exhausted Soil. 

BY J. S. HOUGHTON, M. D. 

There is no theme of greater importance or more 
 immediate interest to the farmer than the art of reno- 
 vating exhausted soil or of bringing sandy and compara- 
 tively barren tracts of land into a state of fertility and 
 profitable cultivation. The art forms, in fact, the basis 
 of all good husbandry, and if it can be done economical- 
 ly and speedily, all other parts of the farmer's work may 
 be carried on successfully. 

Having worked some sandy land in New Jersey, which 
 had been very much exhausted by previous bad farming, 
 I have been led to examine this subject very carefully. 
 The result has been to show me, practically, several 
 methods of accomplishing the object, each in my opinion 
 better, and less expensive than direct manuring with 
 stable manure which has to be purchased. They are as 
 follows: 

1. Growing potatoes and other crops, with large com- 
 post of simple peat, prepared for use with lime and salt, 
 in the proportions of three bushels of lime to one of salt, 
 and eighteen or twenty bushels of this mixture to the 
 quantity of peat used per acre — the lime to be slaked 
 with brine made from the salt. 

2. Using guano and bone dust, (the latter disolved with 
 sulphuric acid) say 300 lbs. of guano per acre, on any 
 crop you choose, (carrots being, where the soil is suit- 
 able, the most profitable for the manure.) 

3. The growing of clover by the aid of guano and plas- 
 ter, with little or no use of composts, and turning under 
 the clover as a green crop. 

4. The growing of the field pea, feeding the same to 
 stock, and making manure for more valued crops. 

The merit of the first three methods I will not now 
 consider. The fourth method I esteem the best. 

The field pea I find, is but little known at the north, 
 though it has been cultivated to some extent in New Jer- 
 sey. The chief reason why it has not been more valued, 
 I think, is because it is not, in itself, a very saleable pro- 
 duct, as grain, and it has not been tried like clover, as 
 a renovator of the soil. At the South, in Virginia, South 
 Carolina, and Georgia, the field pea is now much grown, 
 both to be turned under like clover, and as food for stock. 

The field pea is a clover plant, and like clover may 
 be made to flourish on a very barren and sandy soil, 
 with the lightest possible manuring at all, except the 

use of lime, or plaster of paris, or a little vegetable mat- 
 ter. 

The vine grows about eighteen inches to two feet high, 
 very rank, and spreads over a larrje space like the sweet 
 potatoe or melon vine, and yields a great abundance of 
 large pods, each containing a dozen or more peas, much 
 like the small white bean in shape and size, though of 
 different colors. 

The merit of the crop consists in this — that it costs 
 but little for seed; grows luxuriantly on the poorest soil; 
 requires but little manure; and yields a large amount 
 of valuable fodder and grain; while if turned under green 
 it is equal in value if not superior to clover. It may 
 be grown at once, where clover cannot be started, and 
 requires but little cultivation. The vine green or dry, is 
 eagerly eaten by cows or horses especially if served 
 as "cut feed," and sprinkled with meal; and the grain, 
 if boiled or ground, and fed as meal, will be freely eaten 
 by horses, cows, hogs, and chickens, and is unsurpassed 
 in its nutritive qualities even by wheat itself. Pea meal 
 is especially useful for working cattle, as it abounds in 
 the flesh-forming or nutritious principle, (nitrogen) to a 
 greater extent than any other grain, and is also admira- 
 bly adapted as food for hens, while laying, as it is rich in 
 albumen, is the chief constituent of eggs, and also in sul- 
 phur, so necessary to produce the "hen fruit" in perfec- 
 tion. 

I am not myself, so much in favor of plowing under 
 green crops, as many other persons are. I confess to the 
 weakness of feeling which prevents many persons from 
 sacrificing a well grown crop to the improvement of the 
 soil by ploughing it under. I prefer the plan of feeding 
 all crops to stock and saving the manure which they pro- 
 duce. If the manure be carefully and properly saved, 
 but little is lost by feeding to stoek, while much is gain- 
 ed in working power, flesh, milk, eggs, &c. 

Now take the field pea. You can grow it on sandy 
 and barren soil, where you cannot make a good set of 
 clover without great expenditure of time and money. I 
 grew the southern seed, this last season, on the most 
 barren spot on my farm, (a mere sand heap, where no 
 respectable weed ever flourished, )by planting in the rough- 
 est way possible, with no other manure than a little char- 
 coal. I did not even plough the field, and it has not 
 been ploughed for many years. There was no sod on the 
 field; it was a mere flowing sandy knoll. I just opened 
 the furrows, say four inches deep, and sprinkled in them 
 a light dash of charcoal dust, dropped the seed, having 
 first soaked them in water. It was quite late when I 
 planted them, (after all my corn was in) and fearing they 
 would not mature (as the seed was from Georgia) I sowed 
 them very thick in the drill, in the hope of having a large 
 yield of vines for fodder. The peas sprouted quickly 
 and came up in a few days, and notwithstanding the ex- 
 treme drouth, and the burning sun-shine of last season, 
 the vines grew rank and strong, and remained of a rich 
 deep green the whole season, not a leaf turning yellow or 
 curling up, till September, when the pods all ripened 
 well, and gave a fine yield of peas. The exact yield per 
 acre I am unable to state, as no attempt was made to as- 
 certain it. 

On another field, much higher and drier than the first, 
 I tried a Jersey field pea, planting them in drills, deeply
