ploughed and sub-soiled, and with rich and appropriate 
 compost of guano, bone dust, peat, lime, potash, &c. &c 
 This experiment was also highly successful; but I cannot 
 say which was most satisfactory; for I cut up the last 
 named piece while partially green and fed it to cows and 
 horses, vines, peas and all, as green fodder. 

The cows eat the vines and peas, eagerly, and the milk 
 very perceptibly improved in quantity and quality by 
 their use, but exactly in what proportion I did not at- 
 tempt to ascertain- After the cows had eaten the vines 
 in the yard and had trodden some of them under their 
 feet in the manure and dirt, a horse well fed on timothy 
 and corn meal, was let loose in the yard, and eagerly de- 
 voured the dirty vine left by the cows. 

The vines and peas were also fed, and pigs, which 
 picked off and eat the peas, but did not cat much of the 
 vine, though they would probably have done so if they 
 had not been fed on corn fodder and other more juicy 
 food. 

The peas were also soaked and fed to chickens and 
 hens, which, while having access to much other grain, 
 still eat moderately of them. 

Now this is my idea of the best method of using the 
 Field Tea to obtain profit and manure. 

Plant the pea as early as you do corn, in drills about 
 two and a half feet apart, sowing about as thickly as 
 you would for table peas, or rather less so. Plow your 
 drills as deep as you can, if the nature of the soil per- 
 mit such practice, and then subsoil eight inches more. 
 My reason for sub-soiling is that the pea, like the clo- 
 ver, is a deeply rooted plant, and will be much aided, in 
 times of drouth, by sab-soiling. Manure with dry 
 muck, if you have nothing better, or with guano and 
 plaster of Paris, composted with any vegetable matter, 
 or loam, if you feel disposed; and cultivate as you 
 would for any other peas, beans, carrots, &c. 

The pea vines will cover the whole field, if the drills 
 be not too far apart, with rich green vines and leaves, 
 protecting the soil from the rays of the sun, and collect- 
 ing vast quantities of food from the atmosphere. As 
 soon as the peas begin to ripen, pick the food by hand, 
 if you wish for seed, or the most perfect grain for meal ; 
 and as soon as the larger portion of the peas are gath- 
 ered, and before the vines begin to lose their leaves, 
 sut them with a scythe close to the ground, and cure as 
 you would clover. If cut early, the vines will make a 
 second growth fit for pasture. 

If you have not time or help to pick the peas, and are 
 willing to sacrifice the fodder to the seed, you can let 
 the peas ripen more fully, and then cut the vines, when 
 dry, and thrash out the peas as you would any others. 
 Or, if fodder alone be your object, you may cut the peas 
 before fully ripe, and cure vines and peas together, and 
 feed them together, whole or as cut feed, in the win- 
 ter. 

It was the opinion of the men who cut my vines while 
 in a half green state, that the yield of fodder was far 
 greater than that of a good clover field, and that it was 
 of superior value as food, to say nothing about the peas; 
 but the produce of grain, it was evident, was equal to 
 that of corn. 

The Field Pea sold in Savannah, Georgia, and in Phil- 
 adelphia, last March, at $1.12 and $1.25 per bushel. 

As a part of the food of cows, horses, hogs, or hens, I 
 consider it even more valuable than corn, although it 
 has little fattening power. 

To give it satisfactorily, the farmer should have 
 enough to cut a portion as green food, if he desired it ; 
 another portion should be cut and cured while still part- 
 ly green for winter fodder (peas and vines) — and an- 
 other patch should be kept for seed, cut when ripe and 
 threshed out. Or, if convenient, the seed, and peas for 
 meal, could be hand-picked as they ripened, and the 
 whole field could then be used for fodder. 

Now how is this pea to be a renovator of the soil ? 
 Why thus : it will grow on barren land, with tittle or no 
 manure, where scarcely any thing else will, and furnish 
 two tons or more per a,cre for green crop for turning un- 
 der or for food, and a yield of grain equal to corn or 
 wheat in feeding value. This will support stock, and 
 make manure, where none otherwise could be made, 
 easily and profitably. What other crop will do this f 
 Some may say corn fodder. But the Field Pea will 
 grow where corn fodder will not, and the latter yields 
 no grain. Others may point to the bean. But that 
 makes little, if any, hay. Others may speak of the root 
 crops, the beet, carrot and parsnip. True, these will 
 grow on sandy and barren soils, but, In my experience, 
 they are found to require more manure per acre than 
 even wheat to produce a crop worth keeping clear of 
 weeds There is no plant, that I know of, which can be 
 so easily and cheaply grown on sandy and worn out soils, 
 and which affords so large a yield of food for stock, or 
 material for manure, as the Field Pea. There is a Jer- 
 sey Pea, which is called the "Crowder" by some people; 
 but I do not think it equal to the best southern seed, at 
 least for fodder. Either of these, however, will answer 
 a good purpose. I think pea vines and corn fodder, 
 served as cut food for milch cows, in winter, with a lit- 
 tle corn and pea meal, would furnish an admirable and 
 highly economical food ; and if, to these articles, carrots 
 and parsnips should be added freely, it would leave 
 nothing to be desired by the milkman, or the maker of 
 butter or cheese. The only thing I can think of which 
 it might be desirable to purchase occasionally, where- 
 butter was the object, would be oil-cake, If It could be 
 obtained cheap. And if any man, who can keep all the 
 cattle and chickens he desires to, cannot produce good 
 manure enough to renovate his worn out lands, then he* 
 ought to quit farming at once, and emigrate to Austra- 
 lia, or some other place where gold grows as a natural 
 production of the earth, and don't even require digging.
