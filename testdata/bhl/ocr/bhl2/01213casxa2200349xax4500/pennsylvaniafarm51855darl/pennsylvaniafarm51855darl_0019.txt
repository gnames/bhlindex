that I might be enabled to do it more justice. And 
 when I inform the reader, that I sincerely believe that it 
 comes nearer to what we want in America, to promote 
 correct agriculture, than any thing else I have ever seen, 
 and without which farming can never be reduced to 
 what it should be (to a practical science), he will, I 
 trust, pardon me for calling his attention to the institu- 
 tion and its operations somewhat in detail, by a few ar- 
 ticles on the subject. 

My opportunities for observing it have been as good 
 as they could have been desired. Moeckern is located 
 about three miles distant from Leipsic, but much of the 
 road runs through beautifully laid out shady groves on 
 the banks of a small river, and one makes the distance 
 almost unconscious of the extent of ground he has 
 trod. 

. The Professor, Dr. Rithausen, who now has charge of 
 th8 scientific departments, was carrying out some chem- 
 ical investigations in the University Library of Leipsic, 
 when I entered it last fall, and thus I had the pleasure 
 of making his acquaintance. On visiting the investiga- 
 tion Station a few weeks ago, during the University va- 
 cation, and remarking to the Doctor that the time ap- 
 peared "langweileg," because I was excluded from my 
 regular work in the labratory, he kindly offered me a 
 place at his bench to assist him in some plant and soil 
 analyses, &c, that he had on hand. It is from oppor- 
 tunities thus afforded of seeing and learning the opera- 
 tions of the institution that I propose to write. 

I cannot better set before the reader a clear exposi- 
 tion of the aims and objects of the institution, than by 
 giving a condensed abstract of the constitution of the 
 organization by which it was founded, and then some of 
 the results of its operation thus far, to see to what ex- 
 tent and how it carries out its avowed object. 

The preamble states that after the Saxony farmers of 
 the Leipsic district had learned the necessity of cultiva- 
 ting an intimate relationship with exact scientific exper- 
 imental knowledge and investigation, and the Leipsic 
 Economical Society joined with them, &c, &c, they 
 concluded to found in 1851 an Agricultural Experimen- 
 tal Station upon the farm of the Economical Society at 
 Moeckern, in connection with a portion of adjoining 
 land offered for the purpose by Dr. Cursius (a man noted 
 for his liberal interest in agricultural investigation.) 

The object of the station was to develop and extend 
 agricultural knowledge by scientific investigation, in in- 
 timate connection with practical experiments upon the 
 farm. To accomplish which object a professor should 
 be appointed to attend to the strictly scientific depart- 
 ment, and suggest experiments for the practical depart- 
 ment, and a good skillful practical farmer to attend to 
 the latter. Their united experiments and investigations 
 to be directed to the following questions: 

(a.) The growth of plants and the sources of nutri- 
 ment in the same, to ascertain particularly how far the 
 elements of the atmosphere are instrumental in the 
 same, and what agents (as weeds, &c.,) prevent their 
 growth. 

(b.) The chemical constitution of plants and their ef- 
 fect upon the animal organism, as produced in fodder- 
 ing, for the purposes of keeping stock, fattening, milk 
 and butter production, &c. 

(c.) Metereological observations. 

(d.) Cultivating and testing the qualities of the more 
 seldomly cultivated plants. 

(e.) Trying the efficacy of agricultural implements. 

(f.) To collect reliable agricultm-al knowledge from 
 all sources, domestic and foreign. 

To carry out these investigations the institution shall 
 be divided into a practical agricultural department with 
 the farm, and a scientific department with a chemical 
 labratory and apparatus, ..&c, &e. 

Here follows a detail 6f the controlling committee, the 
 sources of their funds, &c. Every Agricultural Society 
 contributing seventy-five dollars annually can have a 
 vote in the meetings of the controlling committee. In- 
 dividuals subscribing the same can for themselves have 
 the same privilege, or one vote for every seventy-five 
 dollars so subscribed. The professor and farm inspector 
 are admitted to the committee free of charge. The 
 principal funds come from the Economical Society, the 
 Leipsic District Farmers' Association, Dr. Cursius, and 
 the Government of Saxony. 

The committee or officers of the Society laid out a 
 plan for the first year's investigation, of which the fol- 
 lowing is an abstract : 

I. TESTING MANURES AND FODDERS. 

1. To try the economical value of various kinds of 
 Saxony manures, as Dresden Artificial Guano, Leipsic 
 Artificial Guano, Bone Dust, ground and dissolved Sul- 
 phuric Acid, Rape Cake Meal (the residue of the vege- 
 table (brassica rapus and b. napus) oil manufacture) 
 and stale manure. The trial to continue three years on 
 a soil receiving no other manures ; the soil to be chemi- 
 cally examined before and after the trial. 

2. To see to what degree bonedust and guano will pay 
 when used each alone or mixed, one-third guano and 
 two-thirds bonedust, on beets and rape seed ; the effect 
 to be noticed at the end of the second and third year. 

3. To ascertain the value of rape meal as manure, 
 and to what extent it is modified by mixing with bones 
 dissolved in sulphuric acid and common salt. 

4. To learn what manure is the most efficacious in the 
 cultivation of the sugar beet. All those mentioned in- 
 1 to be tried in various specified degrees of mixture and 
 each alone. The produce raised to be chemically exam- 
 ined, and also practically tested in feeding and fodder- 
 ing stock, &c. 

5. Investigation in manuring wheat with Peruvian gu- 
 ano, Chili saltpetre and sulphate of ammonia : (a) sowing 
 it with the grain, plowing it under, and leaving it on tup; 
 (b) putting one-half on in the fall and the other half in 
 the spring, (c) and putting it all on in the spring. 

7. Manuring clover with lime, plaster of Paris, guano 
 and dissolved (in sulphuric acid) bones. 

II. CULTIVATION TH1AI.S. 

1. To attend to the cultivation of the different kinds 
 of the more rarely cultivated potatoes, winter barley 
 and peas ; different kinds of rye, corn (zea maize), to- 
 bacco, teasel, dyers' weed, lucerne, and ornithopue sa- 
 tiva. 

2. The sugar beet, and the effect produced upon the 
 root by removing its leaves for fodder during its growth. 
 To ascertain the comparative value for food for stock of 
 several different kinds of beet specified.
