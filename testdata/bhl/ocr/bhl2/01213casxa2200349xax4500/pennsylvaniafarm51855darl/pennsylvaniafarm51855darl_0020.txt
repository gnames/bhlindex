3. All plant, as far as possible, with deep and subsoil 
 plowing. With twice plowing for the same crop, and 
 with turning manures under and leaving them on top. 

III. VEGETATION TRIALS. 

Embracing a great number of experiments on a small 
 scale, with chemically prepared soils, to see what sub- 
 stances are required, and to what extent, and in what 
 state, and with what degree of relative admixture, they 
 are required to produce the greatest possible yield of 
 several crops specified. To see what substances are de- 
 structive to vegetation, and what are neutral with re- 
 spect to it. 

IV. METEREOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. 

Embracing the height of the barometer, the amount 
 of moisture in the air (by differential thermometer), the 
 rain that falls, the temperature of the air, the soil, the 
 subsoil and the earth at the depth of a few feet, the di- 
 rection of the wind and general state of the weather 
 three times every day. 

V FODDERING TRIALS. 

To find in what relation the nitrogenous and non-ni- 
 trogenous foods should be mixed to produce a maximum 
 effect for keeping, fattening and milking stock. 

The experiment to be tried (a) with sheep, to be fed 
 with weighed quantities of hay alone, and mixed in va- 
 rious proportions with more concentrated food specified; 
 the sheep to be weighed at regular intervals, and the 
 fodder and their excrements to be chemically examined. 
 (b) "With cows to ascertain the changes in the quantity 
 and chemical quality of the milk produced by the vari- 
 ous kinds of food above noted, either alone or mixed in 
 specified and accurately weighed proportions. 

VI. AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTS 

In the chemical labratory, independent of the fore- 
 going, as the analysis of ashes, soils, drain and wash 
 water, fruits, &c. 

VII. TESTING AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENTS 

To try their applicability for various purposes speci- 
 fied. 

The reader may see by the foregoing the avowed ob- 
 ject of the association. It is remarkable for its practi- 
 cal bearing, the extent it embraces, and its complete- 
 ment of detail, much of the latter I have omitted above 
 as it related only to this locality. It is an explicit avow- 
 al to unite science with practical agriculture, according 
 to a definite, systematic and specified plan. I trust be- 
 fore many years th^re will be similar stations all over 
 the United States, at least in the more enterprising 
 States. Who will lay their hands to the work to found 
 the first such station? What wealthy old man, dying 
 without heirs, or with such as don't deserve his wealth, 
 will immortalize his name by endowing the first such 
 station? Is he ambitious? — he may rest assured of a 
 monument in the next generation. Is he patriotic? — he 
 cannot better render services to his country. Is he phi- 
 lanthropic? — 'tis hard to conceive a better method of 
 conferring a blessing upon the heads of the millions that 
 are, in future centuries, to eat the bread of our Ameri- 
 can soil, than by thus contributing to elevate the stan- 
 dard of American agriculture. But, perhaps, says the 
 cool minded reader, you had better see to what extent 
 the station carries out its avowed object, before you are 
 lost in enthusiastic admiration of the avowal of the same? 

True, and it is from what has already been done, and 
 what is now under operation, that I found my hopes of 
 its success and desire to see similar ones in my native 
 country. This part of my subject shall be my theme for 
 my following letters. 

In conclusion I would remark that this Station differs 
 from an Agricultural School. There have been quite 
 recently established in Germany several agricultural 
 schools, as those of Theisbaden, Hoenheim, &c, (these 
 I shall notice particularly in turn,) but the "stations" 
 do not necessarily admit students. Their object is to 
 stand at the outposts of science, and grind out original 
 facts from uninvestigated nature, and shape them into 
 science that they can be brought before the agriculturist 
 and the student of the agricultural school. Such an in- 
 stitution could most advantageously be combined with 
 an agricultural school and model farm, yet its operations 
 should not be burdened with the responsibility of teach- 
 ing to such a degree as to interfere with or prevent their 
 original investigations. The importance of the last re- 
 marks will be more apparent after we consider the na- 
 ture of these investigations. Although it has been but 
 three years since the first of these stations was estab- 
 lished, there are already three such in Saxony now (at 
 Moeckern, Chemnity and Dresden). Adieu at present.

 Shanghaes, Cochin Chinas, &c. 

Mr. Editor : — During the last two or three years, I 
 have been laboring under a severe attack of the "Shang- 
 hae fever." Recently, however, my symptoms show 
 signs of some abatement of the disease, and as its viru- 
 lence is being gradually mitigated, (probably from the 
 depletion of my purse,) I am growing more and more of 
 the opinion that I have been very considerably hum- 
 bugged in some of my speculations. 

I have been very careful, and incurred no little ex- 
 pense, to keep my several breeds of fowls apart. That 
 is, I have a separate pen each for my Shanghaes, Cochin 
 Chinas, Brahma Pootras, Chittagongs, &c, &c, and af- 
 ter careful breeding and closo observation for two or 
 three years, I am decidedly of the opinion that the four 
 varieties above named are all the same breed of fowls. 
 They vary in color, it is true, which can be as readily 
 controlled as accounted for, but as to their being a differ- 
 ent kind, I do not believe a word of it. I was green 
 enough to pay high prices for each of these varieties, 
 and I am now beginning to feel as though I had been 
 "pretty considerably taken in." 

Are you posted up in the laws of chicken-dom, Mr. 
 Editor ? If so, I would be glad to have your views 
 through the columns of your Journal. J. McM.

We are not very well "posted up in the laws of chick- 
 en-dom," and as the poultry "doctors" have disagreed 
 upon this question, our opinion would carry but little 
 weight with it. The best authority we can quote upon 
 the matter, for the relief of our correspondent, is a work 
 recently published in England, a notice of which we find 
 among the Reports of the Massachusetts Board of Agri- 
 culture. This work is entitled "The Poultry Book : 
 comprising the Characteristics, Management, Breeding
