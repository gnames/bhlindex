and Medical Treatment of Poultry, &c., &c, by Rev. W. 
 Wingfield, Honorary Secretary of the Cornwall Poultry 
 Society, and G. W. Johnson, Honorary Secretary of the 
 Winchester Society for the Improvement of Poultry." 

As such distinguished authority is entitled to due 
 consideration, we extract the following from a chapter 
 headed "History and Description of the Shanghae 
 Fowl: 1 ' 

"There is a doubt, which had better be removed from 
 the very threshold, usually conveyed in the question — 
 '•Are Cochin China and Shanghae fowls the same?" 
 We have always entertained the opinion that they are ; 
 and as we have invariably found that fowls imported 
 from China into this country, whether feather-legged or 
 plain-legged, whether dark-plumaged or light-plumaged, 
 came hither, directly or indirectly, either from Shang- 
 hae or its vicinity, we have long since concluded that 
 '■Cochin China" is a name altogether misapplied to this 
 variety. This conclusion amounts to conviction, since 
 we have received a letter from Mr. Robert Fortune, who 
 has passed so many years in various parts of China, in 
 which he says: "The man who first gave these fowls the 
 name of Cochin China has much to answer for. I firm- 
 ly believe that what are called Cochin Chinas and 
 Shanghaes are one and the same. One thing is certain, 
 — the breed you have in this country as Cochin China, 
 are plentiful about Shanghae. They were discovered 
 there after the war, and frequently brought to this coun- 
 try, and taken to India by captains of trading vessels. 
 Was not this the date of their introduction into Eng- 
 land ? And what grounds has any one for supposing 
 the fowls ever saw Cochin China? W r e thought that this 
 variety might have been earlier known, owing to our 
 long established commerce with Macao and Canton, but 
 Mr. Fortune says that this breed is but little known in 
 those warmer parts of China, and that, in fact, the 
 southern Chinese were as much struck with the size of 
 the breed as we were." He adds : "The Shanghae 
 breed seems to be more common about Shanghae than 
 anywhere else in the north, but I have found it over all 
 the low country of that part of China. The southern 
 breeds have been long well known to ship captains and 
 English residents ; but there is nothing very marked in 
 their character." 

"We have already stated that we do not believe there 
 are any grounds for the belief that this varietj' ever saw 
 Cochin China ; and we think, with Mr. Fortune, (for his 
 question is indicative as well as inquisitive,) that they 
 were introduced into this country soon after the more 
 northern parts of "the Celestial Empire," such as 
 Shanghae. were thrown open to our traders, at the con- 
 clusion of the Chinese war, in 1843. At the poultry 
 show held at the Zoological Gardens, in the May of 1845, 
 there were prizes especially devoted to "Malays and oth- 
 er Asiatic breeds ;" but these brought to the exhibition 
 no other oriental variety than the Malays. In fact, we 
 never met with any published notice of the Shanghae 
 fowls until 1846, and we shall be near the truth if we 
 assign 1845 as the year they were first imported. It 
 was in that year that Her Majesty received specimens of 
 them which she exhibited at the Show of the Royal 
 Dublin Agricultural Society, in the April of 1846." 

"Having thus traced out the date of the introduction 

and the place whence derived, let us next inquire some- 
 thing of the characteristics and treatment of the birds 
 as they occur at Shanghae itself ; and here Mr. Fortune 
 again conies to our aid. In the letter already quoted, 
 he says: "The Shanghae breed occurs both with feath- 
 ered and unfeathered legs, but more frequently unfeath- 
 ered. The most admired kinds there are the game [i. e. 
 partridge or pheasant] colored ones. Many of them are 
 [colored] much like the pheasant of the country. How- 
 ever, I am safe in saying that the Chinese do not attach 
 so much importance as we do to purity of color ; large 
 size and large eggs are what they most admire and 
 prize." 

"It being certain that the true Shanghae fowl is met 
 within its native district with plain legs, even more fre- 
 quently than with legs feathered, or booted, as it is tech- 
 nically termed, the point often disputed is now settled, 
 as to whether this is any demonstration of a distinct 
 breed. Henceforth it must be held to be a mere matter 
 of taste. 

"Mr. Fortune's testimony settles another disputed 
 point. It is very evident that, except as a matter of 
 taste, the light colored should have no preeminence over 
 the darker plumaged ; and those Societies have acted 
 judiciously which have given separate prizes of equal 
 value to all the subvarieties of color. It is judicious, 
 because it is needlessly placing a judge in a very per- 
 plexing position to call upon him to decide upon speci- 
 mens of equal merit in all important points, but differing 
 in color." 

The work then speaks of the black, white, gray, (or 
 so-called "Brahma Pootra,") buff, cinnamon, and par- 
 tridge or grouse-colored Shanghaes as subvarieties of 
 one breed. In regard to the "Brahma Pootras," speci- 
 mens of which, introduced from this country, are known 
 to the authors, — their "history" is summed up by an 
 expression of the opinion, "that it. will not prove a dis- 
 tinct breed, but either a variety of the Shanghae fami- 
 ly, or the result of a cross between those birds and the 
 Malay.!! This is just what they are known to be in this 
 country. Some of them came from Shanghae, and some 
 are a cross of these and the "Chittagong," a term which, 
 as used by English authors on poultry, is only a synonym 
 of Malay. Hence they were at first, and still are in 

many places, merely called "Chittagongs."

 Profitable Hens. 
 Mr. Editor: — Below I give you a statement of th« 
 number of eggs, and the chickens that I have raised this 
 year. I had on the 1st of January, 1854, thirty-five 
 hens and two Black Spanish cocks; my hens are Black 
 Spanish, Cochin China and Creelys; from these hens I 
 have had two thousand four hundred and five eggs, viz: 
 in January one hundred and fifty-eight, in February 
 one hundred and ninty-one, in March three hundred and 
 ninty-five, in April two hundred and sixty -four, in May 
 three hundred, in June two hundred and thirty-seven, 
 in July two hundred and twenty-three, in August one 
 hundred and sixty-four, in September sixty-five, in Oc- 
 tober thirty, in November forty, and to the 6th of Decem- 
 ber eighteen, these with two hundred and sixty that wer. 
 set make the above number (2405 eggs); from the two 
 hundred and sixty set, I only obtained one hundred and
