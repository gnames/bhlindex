ninety-seven chickens, (I attribute the loss of so many 
 eggs to their being pullets, as 1 never find their eggs to 
 hatch so well as those obtained from those that have laid 
 one season) and only succeeded in raising one hundred 
 and fifty-one chickens. Most of the balance were lost 
 before they were ten days old. I had twenty chickens 
 hatched on the thirteenth day of March, and raised them 
 all. My method of sitting my hens I consider good, and 
 think I am well repaid for the little trouble that it re- 
 quires, it is this: place a barrel (with a petition part 
 half way back in it so as the nest will be in the back of 
 the barrel,) on the ground with a box made of lath in 
 front so as to confine the hen and keep others from troub- 
 ling her, and place her food and water in it. I like this 
 plan better than any other that I have tried. One of 
 my pullets hatched on the thirteenth day of March, com- 
 menced to lay five days before she was five months old, 
 and up to this date at three different layings has layed 
 thirty-seven eggs, and is not yet nine months old; she is 
 a rare exception. I find that my pullets that are hatch- 

ed very early in the season lay at the age of from six to 
 seven months, those raised later in the season do not lay 
 sooner than from eight to nine months; one of my hens, 
 On the fifteenth day after hatching out a brood of ten 
 chickens commenced laving, ami layed seven eggs before 
 leaving her brood of chickens, which was at the begin- 
 ning of the fifth week. 

1 think the number of eggs layed by my hens is very 
 large, when the chickens raised and the consequent time 
 lost by each hen in setting and raising them is consider 
 ed ; their principal feed was corn and occasionally oats, 
 with what they could pick from a field of grass contain- 
 ing three acres. 

If you consider that the above will be of any interest 
 to the readers of your Journal, I shall be amply satisfied 
 for the little trouble it has given me. 

I have kept an account from day to day of all that I 
 have mentioned above, and do not make any statement 
 from memory, but from my memorandum book.

KIRKLEAVINGTON 1ST (11643). 

Bred by George Vail, of Troy, N. Y. — light roan ; got 
 by imported Duke of Wellington (3654), dam (Lady Bar- 
 rington 3d) by Cleveland Lad (3407), g. d. (Lady Bar- 
 rington 2d) by Belvidere (1706), g. g. d. (Lady Barring- 
 ton) by a son of Mr. Mason's Herdsman (304), g. g. g 
 d. (Young Alicia) by Wonderful (700), g. g. g. g. d. (Old 
 Alicia) by Alfred (23), g. g. g. g. g. d. by Young Favor- 
 ite, son of Favorite (252). 

Kirkleavington's sire and dam were both bred by the 
 late Thomas Bates. He was sold by Mr. "Vail to Judge 
 Sheldon, ot Sennett, N. Y., who lately sold him at the 
 price of $800 to Messrs. Paoli Lathrop, of South Had- 
 ley Falls, J. A. Clark, of Granby, and G. M. Atwater, 
 of Springfield Massachusetts. He is kept on Mr. La- 

throp's farm ; is a large, healthy and vigorous animal — 
 considered equal, and by some superior, to any bull ever 
 bred by Mr. Vail. His dam received the highest prize 
 (in her size) of the New York State Agricultural Socie- 
 ty, and gave, as stated by Mr. Vail, twenty- two quarts 
 of milk per day. 

Mr. Lathrop, as we have before mentioned, has been 
 breeding Short-Horns since 1839, and has produced 
 some choice animals. He has always paid considerable 
 attention to the milking qualities of his stock, and has 
 given us the following memoranda in regard to the yield 
 of some of his cows: 

Lucilla, at four years old, averaged 55 lbs. of milk 
 per day for a month, and made 14£ lbs. of butter per
