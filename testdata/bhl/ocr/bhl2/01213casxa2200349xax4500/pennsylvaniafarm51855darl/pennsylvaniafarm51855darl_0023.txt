week. The year following she gave in one week 837 lbs. 
 of milk, which produced 15 lbs. 3 oz. butter. The 
 greatest yield of milk in any one day was 59| lbs. 
 Louisa, at eight years old, averaged for the month of 
 June 53 lbs. of milk per day, and made 14 lbs. 2 oz. 
 butter per week. Dorothy, at five years old, made 15 
 lbs. 1 oz. butter per week, on grass. Cherry, at six 
 years old, made 15 lbs. of butter per week on grass. 
 Rose 2d, on hay alone, made 10^ lbs. batter per week. 
 Luna, at two years old, made 9 lbs. 2 oz. butter per 
 week. Rose 1st, at two years old, gave from 32 to 35 
 lbs. of milk per day for the month of June. Ruby, at 
 four years old, averaged 48 lbs. of milk per day for a 
 month. The next year she calved in July, and in Octo- 
 ber following averaged 44£ lbs. of milk per day for ten 
 days in succession. Yellowskin gave 18 quarts of milk 
 per day, beer measure. 

W'c may mention in this connection, that Mr. C. B. 
 Clark, who has frequently had cattle of Mr. Lathrop, 
 now owns several superior Short-Horn eows that are 
 kept at Granby, one of which produced 15 lbs. of butter 
 per week in the month of September, last year. 

INDIAN APPLE. 

This is a very handsome winter apple. Size, rather 
 above medium, but less when the tree is heavily laden ; 
 fruit, conical, sometimes roundish ; color, a beautiful 
 dark mahogany red, covered with small yellow dots or 
 spots on the surface, often lighter red around the base 
 and cavity, almost inclining to a thin russet ; stalk, 
 slender, from one-quarter to half an inch long, set in a 
 rather deep acute cavity; basin, often narrow and shal- 
 low, the calyx partially closed ; flesh, fine grained and 
 firm, yellow and rich, with an agreeable, moderate, sub- 
 acid flavor; leaves, doubly serate. 

This fruit is among the most valuable of our winter 
 apples, keeps till late in the spring, and has been kept 
 until the return of another crop. The tree is a moder- 
 ate grower, and when in bearing produces more or less 
 every year. Every other year the crops are abundant, 
 not like many other sorts bearing two or three fine crops 
 and are then exhausted, such as the Belle-flcur, &c. The 

fruit is. always fair, and not covered with lichens or 
 scabs, as many of our winter apples are, but has always 
 sustained its high character. I have a fine crop of them 
 this season. The original tree was found growing in 
 front of the last Indian wigwam in Delaware, hence the 
 name. JONATHAN C. BALDWIN.

The Jennetting Apple. 

We noticed this fruit on page 363 of our last volume, 
 and copied from the Patent Office Report for 1853 the 
 statement by Micajah Burnett, of the United Society of 
 Shakers, Pleasant Hill, Mercer county, Kentucky, that 
 the tree was "nearly three weeks later in blooming than 
 others, (among which were the Rambo, Fall Pippin, 
 Belle-fleur, &c.,) thus escaping the late frosts. 

As nothing was said in Mr. Burnett's statement rela- 
 tive to the quality of a fruit, which, if good, would be 
 of great account in this latitude, where late frosts so 
 frequently render the orchards almost fruitless, and not 
 being certain of its being described in any of the fruit 
 works, we addressed a note to him requesting further 
 information, which he has kindly given ; from which it 
 will be seen that it is is probably that known by the 
 name of Raul's Jennet. 

In his letter he states that the "Jennetting apple is 
 largely cultivated in this section, and lias been consider- 
 ed our best winter variety, on account of the certainty 
 of the crop as well as on account of its good qualities. 
 It is about the medium size — near that of the Rambo — 
 matures late, becomes mellow about Christmas, is juicy, 
 well flavored and good, and for culinary purposes it is 
 unsurpassed. The tree grows slowly, though vigorous- 
 ly, is a full and heavy bearer, and the apples, if not 
 eai-lier taken off, will hang on with gi-eat tenacity until 
 late in the fall or early winter. Seasonably and proper- 
 ly gathered, and rightly secured, the apple keeps till 
 June and later." 

It is scarcely necessary that we should ask the atten- 
 tion of orchard is ts and farmers generally to this fruit. 
 It is so manifestly one of the varieties that should have 
 a place in every orchard in this latitude, that the mere 
 statement of its good qualities w T ill insure its general 
 cultivation. 

Domestic Recipes. 
 Rabbit Soup. — Begin this soup six hours before din- 
 ner. Cut up three large, but young and tender rabbits, 
 or four small ones, (scoring the backs.) and dredge them 
 with flour. Slice six mild onions, and season them with 
 half a grated nutmeg; or more, if you like it. Put 
 some fresh butter into a hot frying pan, (you may sub- 
 stitute for the butter some cold roast-veal gravy that has 
 been carefully cleared from the fat,) place it over the 
 fire, and when it boils, put in the rabbits and onions, 
 and fry them a light brown. Then transfer the whole to 
 a soup-pot ; season it with a very small tea-spoonful of 
 salt, a tea-spoonful of whole pepper, a large tea-spoon- 
 ful of sweet-marjoram leaves stripped from the stalks, 
 and four or five blades of mace, adding three large car- 
 rots in slices. Pour on, slowly, four quarts of hot water 
 from a kettle already boiling hard. Cover the soup-pot, 
 and let it simmer slowly (skimming it well) till the meat
