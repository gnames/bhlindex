ute moths. The last seem to be the most abundant and 
 the most common. Their presence is made known by 
 the castings or grain-like fragments thrown out of their 
 burrows upon the surface of the warts. These tumors 
 also afford nourishment to certain vegetable parasites, 
 the little black grains, half immersed in the surface, to 
 which, when mature, they give a deep black color. 
 These little grains are fungi, which have been described 
 under the name of Spharia morbosa. But neither to 
 them, nor to the various insects before named, 'is the 
 origin of the warts to be ascribed. The incipient warts 
 can be detected, before the outer bark is ruptured, by 
 the swollen appearance and spongy feeling of the sur- 
 face. They seem to be the result of diseased action in 
 the inner bark and new wood, while these parts are in a 
 state of rapid formation. Upon examination, the cells 
 of the tissues are found to be surcharged with fluid, and 
 distorted in shape and arrangement. The plum tree has 
 been called a gross feeder. It may imbibe fluids by its 
 roots faster than it can exhale the superfluous moisture 
 from its leaves ; or the function of the latter may be 
 checked by such sudden changes in temperature and in 
 the hygrometric state of the atmosphere as are common 
 in the spring. In either case, there would be likely to 
 ensue an accumulation of fluid in the branches, and par- 
 ticularly in the tender issues of the new wood, where 
 warts are most commonly developed. 

"From experiments made upon my own trees, I have 
 reason to believe that the growth of these tumors may, 
 in great measure, be prevented by severe root-pruning, 
 stimulating the bai-k in the spring, or before the buds 
 expand, by washing it with soft soap, and by cutting off 
 the warts as soon as formed, and applying salt or brine 
 to the wounds." 

Manures. 

Editor Pennsylvania Farm Journal: — I notice that the 
 columns of your Journal, of a late number especially, 
 are largely devoted to the subject of manures and their 
 application and preservation, and a few additional re- 
 marks deduced from experience may not be taken amiss. 

The field where the result of this trial was derived 
 contains about three acres, sloping gently towards the 
 south, the soil consisting of a clay, slate gravel, mixed 
 with loam, — being in a high* state of cultivation, well 
 limed, manured and subsoiled, (by well liming I mean 
 from 130 to 150 bushels to the acre and even upwards, 
 I have applied 200 bushels to the acre with the best re- 
 sults.) 

This lot in 1853 produced over seven tons of hay at 
 first cutting in the middle of June. The hay consisted 
 of clover mixed with timothy. In the fall it was again 
 mowed for clover seed. 

It became desirable to have this lot lay over another 
 year for grass, though a thing rarely done by farmers of 
 this neighborhood; they rotate their crops every four 
 years, for example : 1st grass, 2d corn, 3d oats and 4th 
 wheat, The manure and lime are now mainly applied 
 on the corn lands. 

The lot was quite uniform all over in many respects. 
 In the spring when the grass was taking a start, we ap- 
 plied 200 pounds Peruvian Guano broadcast, previously 
 mixed with dry alluvium. Now, honestly, the effect was 

just nothing at all. I directed the attention of some of 
 my friends to it, and all agreed that they could not see 
 any perceptible difference whatever. I have now tried 
 this same experiment for three successive years on diff- 
 erent lots of ground, and with different parcels of guano, 
 with the same result. On corn I have also experiment- 
 ed with, and even then it is far inferior to the cleanings 
 of the hen-roost. I am fully convinced that its fertilizing 
 properties have been much exaggerated, and I presume 
 especially by those who make it a business to deal in the 
 article. On lands like there are in this valley, which in 
 natural fertility have been rarely surpassed, and besides 
 have been extensively limed and plastered, guano avails 
 us nothing. 

The effects of guano may be, and no doubt are, far 
 more perceptible on worn out lands, but it is very vola- 
 tile in its nature, and I question whether such be not 
 the worse for it in a year or two. I am sure in this, 
 that guano has — probably from its volatizing properties 
 — volatalized "rocks" in the pockets of my honest farm- 
 ing neighbors, for which they never got a just equiva- 
 lent. 

If we want guano we can prepare an excellent, if not 
 a superior, article at home, and need not send ships to 
 Peru with the hard earned surplus of the farmer, main- 
 ly for the purpose of enriching a set of speculators, and 
 as I have already hinted, they are the persons who do 
 no small share in lauding the fertilizing properties of 
 this article. Farmers, think of this ! Imposition is .de- 
 tested by us all, and the credulity of the farmer has 
 been burrowed upon in no small degree. Why, the far- 
 mer has more means of making fertilizing materials 
 than any other class of men, or at least sufficient to ren- 
 der fruitful any land that is arable. Now, if any body 
 possess any extra philanthropy in this particular, why 
 not endeavor to inform the farmer how he can avail him- 
 self of all these articles by means of his own exertions. 
 But no, this would interfere with some of the renowned 
 fertilizing wares. 

Some few of the dandy portion of the farmers would 
 probably consider it rather dirty work to make their own 
 guano, &c, and would object to it on that ground. 
 There is a little something in that. Yet even those very 
 characters will commit deeds of the filthiest and darkest 
 dyes in point of moial principle without hesitation. 
 Dandyism and moral deformation hold close relationship 
 — the fruit thereof is idleness. 

All alkalies render the elementary constituents of the 
 soil more soluble and twice more available for the elim- 
 ination of plants. Now T guano can do no more. Its 
 virtues depend mainly upon its ammoniacal gas, which 
 has an alkaline re-action. Some maintain that plants 
 will just "drink up" this gas. This is an absurd idea. 
 Plants must digest their aliment as well as animals, 
 the functions being carried on by a different set of or- 
 gans ; yet all these functions should be well studied be 
 fore we can begin to minister to their wants to any ad • 
 vantage. 

As regards covered or uncovered manure banks — 
 when manure is scattered carelessly .all over a barnyard 
 of a quarter of an acre in extent, and thus left exposed 
 to the rains and snows, it will certainly lose much of its 
 fertilizing property. However, this 6tate of affairs
