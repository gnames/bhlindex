only indicia the home of a very careless manager. 
 Housing the manure banks does not answer well in 
 this section; the mode of farming pursued affords much 
 straw-more, in fact, than could be consumed by ordi- 
 nary littering. Farmers here generally dung stables 
 twice a week. The manure is drawn with horse and sled 
 for this purpose to some convenient place, where it is 
 out of the way, but never, before the stable door, and 
 carefully piled up in sections, in sizes proportioned to 
 the cleanings. These layers are regularly covered With 
 straw, until this surplus is consumed ; the main portion 
 is worked into the lower part of the bank. Straw is 
 seldom sold off the farms. 

The rains are thus left to fall upon it, Which seems to 
 effect just in a proper degree the necessary moisture for 
 the fermentation all manures should undergo previous 
 to application, or otherwise much of the fertile proper- 
 ties will not be rendered available. 

Covered manure banks dry out too much. We are 
 obliged to consume a large quantity of straw, and I have 
 ' observed where the trial has been made by two of my 
 neighbors, this straw would not get sufficiently moist 
 to allow it to ferment ; or as it is generally expressed, 
 the manure would not act— it remained nearly all straw. 
 This difficulty might in some measure be overcome by 
 manure cellars immediately bcloW the stables, where all 
 the excrernentitious matter of the cattle would go to aid 
 in bringing about the necessary moisture for fermenta- 
 tion. But this ia not Without objectionable features, for 
 this very reason : all the affluvia would be more or less 
 confined to the buildings, which would prove unwhole- 
 some for man and beast. Say you, "we can ventilate 
 such stables." True, but such renders stables cold in 
 winter. 

There is nothing superior for this climate, to meet all 
 the desired ends, than the stables in the old fashioned 
 Swiss bank-barn. If these be regularly cleaned, and 
 well littered, the rattle will be healthy; and the manure 
 if properly piled tip, as we have already pointed out, 
 will prove of a very superior quality. I have seen these 
 banks twelve feet high after they were fully rotten; they 
 are generally left inclined on one side, so that the top is 
 rendered accessible for the sled. When and wherever 
 such are applied, or such banks are brought to make 
 their distribution, it will mark the arid field with ver- 
 dure. These banks are, after all, the true farmers' bank 
 for the husbandman, the sure investment in which affords 
 an annual dividend of rich and golden harvests. Ma- 
 nure constitutes in reality the true touch-stone of the 
 phantom bubble of the alchymists, for it actually con- 
 verts the crude soil into beautiful gold— a thing the 
 philosophers of the middle ages have sought for in vain 
 in other channels. With the attentive husbandman it is 
 often converted into "rocks," (though not into "the rock 
 of ages,") which have built our barns and houses for 
 many long ages gone by. Truly yours, &c,

Cure for Grapo Mildew. 
 Mr. John Hayes, gives through the English Gardeners 
 Chronicle the following "cure for the grape mildew:" — 
 Take \ lb of black soft soap, from 3 to 4 ounces of black 

sulphur, the same quantity of soot and quick lime, and 
 add water sufficient to enable them to be worked with a 
 paint-brush. As soon as the Vines are pruned, paint the 
 wood well over with this mixture, rubbing it well into 
 the rough parts with the brush. I have not seen the 
 least symptoms of mildew since I have used it. either in 
 the houses or out of doors, although we had plenty of it 
 before the application was tried. This, therefore, may 
 be worth the notice of Vine growers in foreign countries, 
 the ingredients employed being cheap. 

Profits of Fowls. 
 1 have seventeen hens at this time, and have lost along 
 during the season some four or six. They are the old 
 fashion kind of hens, and quite a number of them are 
 from four to seven years old. They have laid from 
 about the middle of February to November 9th, inclu- 
 sive, 2017 eggs, which at fourteen cents— the average 
 price— amounts to $25 85. The cost of keeping during 
 the time has been $10 87, all of which I have bought at 
 this year's high prices. Thus they have netted me 
 $12 66 clear profit. My practice is to keep lime ahd 
 feed in the hen house all the time, and as a general 
 thing to let them run at large. They have done little 
 or no damage in the garden, to which they have free ac- 
 cess. Corn I find to be altogether the cheapest feed for 
 them. One hen stole her nest aiid hatched 10 chickens, 
 and the cost of raising the four that were not killed is 
 included in the ahoxe.—Berfohire Cultitrist.

Worth Knowing. 
 It ie said that a small piece of resin dipped in the 
 water which is placed in a vessel on the stove will add a 
 peculiar property to the atmosphere of the room, which 
 will give relief to persons troubled with a cough. The 
 heat of the water is sufficient to throw off the aroma of 
 the resin, and gives the same relief as is afforded by a 
 combustion of the resin. It is preferable to the combus- 
 tion, because the evaporation is more durable. The 

same resin may be used for weeks.

Guano on Potatoes. 
 The following from the Rural New Yorker corresponds 
 entirely with our own experience and observation of its ef- 
 fects in this vicinity. Fair experiments have been made by 
 our farmers, in their potatoe crop, of itfl valu? compared 
 with barn yard manure, and almost uniformly in favor of 
 the Guano. The Guano portion has continued greener and 
 more flourishing through the season, and yielded much lar- 
 ger returns in the gathering:— " We have frequently recom- 
 mended Peruvian Guano as a manure for Po'.atoes, thinking, 
 from their comparatively high price, that its application 
 would be found not only beneficial but profitable. Two years 
 ago, II. C. Ives, Esq., at our recommendation, applied 600 
 lbs. of Peruvian Guano on two acres of potatoes, and left 
 other two acres adjoining without any thing. The Guanoed 
 two acres yielded 410 bushels, and the unguanoed two acres 
 238 bushels, and thus 300 lbs. of Peruvian Guano per acre, 
 costing about $9, gave an increase of 86 bushels. 

This year, Mr. Charles W. Seelye, of Rochester, applied 
 300 lbs. of Peruvian Guano oti two acres of potatoes, leaving 
 four rows in the centre of the field without any dressing. 
 The two acres produced about 225 bushels. The four rows 
 without guano gave 11 bushels, and four rows the same 
 length which reeojved guano, gave 14 bashes. Tbia is
