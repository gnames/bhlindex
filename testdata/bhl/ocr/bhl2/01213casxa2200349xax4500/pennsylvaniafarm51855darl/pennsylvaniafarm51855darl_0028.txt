 well known that guano requires a moist season to bring out apparatus, from two hours to 10 weeks old, which were in 

its full effect. The small increaso, as compared with Mr. 
 Ives' experiment, is also probably owing to the same cause. 
 Peruvian guano has been used in England, as a manure for 
 potatoes to a considerable extent, for eight or ten years. 
 We may fairly conclude, therefore, that English farmers find 
 its application profitable, otherwise the practice would soon 
 bo abandoned. But potatoes generally command a higher 
 price here than in England, and if guano is a profitable ma- 
 nure for potatoes there, why is it not at least equally so 
 here ? Guano will give as great increase of wheat here as 
 there; in fact, if we may credit the statements of Virginia 
 and Maryland farmers, it gives a somewhat greater increase; 
 but its application here, as a general thing, will not be so 
 profitable as in England, because wheat sells at a much 
 lower price. With potatoes, carrots, cabbage, beets, onions, 
 <fcc, the reverse holds true, and we believe a judicious ap- 
 plication of good Peruvian guano will be found profitable. 
 Under some circumstances, when hay is high it will also 
 yield a good return on meadow land. If any of our readers 
 have used guano, nitrate of soda, "3faj]es' improved," or 
 other superphosphate of lime, we should be glad to hear 
 from them.

Minasi's Artificial Incubator. 
 We find the following description of Minasi's hatcher in 
 the London Mechanical Magazine. Cannot some enterpri- 
 sing "fowl fancier" — a breeder of Black Spanish for instance 
 — improve upon it, so as to supply an adjunct to those breeds 
 that "lay constantly but never set:" — "Every one possessed 
 of a knowledge of the circumstances under which the natu- 
 ral hatching of eggs is effected, will be aware that a steady 
 heat of a suitable tomporaturo, maintained for a certain 
 number of days, and a sufficient quantity of fluid to supply 
 the place of the aqueous exhalations which pass off from the 
 egg during incubation, are necessary to the success of any 
 attempt to produce the chick from the egg in a healthy and 
 natural eondition. In order to supply these Mr. Minasi 
 constructs a water-tight case or tray of zinc, of about 1 inch 
 in depth, and fills it with water, which is maintained at such 
 a temperature that a. layer of fine sand placed on the upper 
 surface of the case is constantly kept by it at about 107°. 
 Upon this layer the eggs to be hatched are placed, and cov- 
 ered with a sheet of glass or other suitable substance. In 
 order to furnish the vapour necessary to compensate for the 
 aqueous evaporation from the egg, which, if allowed to pro- 
 ceed to a great extent without any counteracting action, 
 would lead to the destruction of the chick in ovo, the inventor 
 arranges in the incubator a number of short tubes, extending 
 from the under side of it to the upper, and reaching above the 
 layer before mentioned, so that atmospheric or other moist- 
 ure may pass up from beneath and distribute itself over the 
 whole of the surfaces of the eggs. The lamp employed is fit- 
 ted with certain improvements, also effected by Mr. Minasi, 
 by which naphtha is burned, without the use of a wick, so 
 as to keep up a constant temperature for several weeks with- 
 out any attention ; and in order to economize the heat ob- 
 tained from the lamp, the former is made to traverse a spiral 
 flue, to the sides of which a portion of it is continually 

Misers of Minutes. 
 The fallowing from the Christian Observor although not 
 "strioiiy agricultural" is worthy of a place in an agricultural 
 journal, and who among us may not profit by the lesson it 
 teaches: 

" Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of 
 themselves," is the secret of growing rich. And in the time- 
 currency, moments are the gold-filings — the precious atoms 
 that, saved or lost, make or unmake a life. No man can 
 afford to lose his minutes. The miracles of success that 
 have been wrought in the lives of certain men have been 
 achieved through economy of time, as close as Thomas 
 Elwes's economy of farthings. Elihu Burritt, the learned 
 blacksmith, once said that he acquired some knowledge of 
 fifty languages during the intervals of his labors at the an- 
 vil. He treasured his minutes, as his only earthly "fortune." 
 Dr. Mason Good, the learned English author, composed his 
 translation of a Latin book in the streets of London during 
 his extensive walks and rides to visit his numerous patients. 
 His practice was to take in his pocket two or three leaves of 
 the original. He read this passage over as he walked along 
 until he had engraven it on his retentive memory. Then 
 he translated the passage in hi? mind, corrected it, and when 
 he reached home committed the translation to paper. Ho 
 thus finished the work without omitting a single profession- 
 al visit ! Richard Baxter, who wrote more discourses and 
 books, and visited more frequently his parishioners than any 
 clergyman of that century, (thereby affording a rebuke and 
 example to many ministers of our day) was a miser of min- 
 utes. His good example was contagious among his flock. 
 He taught the Kidderminster weavers to fasten religious 
 books on their looms, and study their contents while they 
 were throwing the shuttle. 

He that loses his minutes, loses his life — too often loses 
 his soul. For we never have any thing but tho present mo- 
 ment. The past is gone the future is not ours. And the 
 sea captain who should sit and heave out his cargo by tho 
 single package would come into port at last with about the 
 same character for sagacity as the spendthrift of time comes 
 to the death-bed that ends his life-voyago. It is a total 
 loss and no insurance. 

It would be both curious and sad for us to cast up a strict 
 inventory of our wasted moments in a single day. The 
 time lost in the morning in debating with ourselves whether 
 we shall get up or not — (instead of following the example 
 of systematic John Wesley, who, when he was tempted to 
 loiter in bed, was overheard to call out, "Well John Wesley! 
 you may do as you like, but / mean to get up") — the time 
 lost in indecision as to the day's work, in making long talks 
 or long visits when shorter ones would achieve more, in idle 
 reveries, in trifling awhile between each separate engagement 
 — the aggregate of each day's loss from such causes would 
 be startling. Added together, they might occupy longer 
 time than it took Milton to write the Paradise Lost, or Bun- 
 yan to write the Pilgrim's Progress; longer time than Fulton 
 was occupied in constructing his steamboat, or Gallileo in
