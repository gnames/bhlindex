Reader make a close calculation of a single day's losses 
 and you will be frightened. And let me hint to you, too, 
 that you will work a great saving in your pastor's precious 
 time by avoiding needless calls upon him in his study-hours, 
 (which ought to be in the morning,) and by not keeping him 
 waiting when he calls upon you. "Be short," is as good a 

motto for the parish as it is for the pulpit.

Why Don't He Do It? 

We find the following home queries going the rounds among 
 our exchanges, without name or credit, although deserving 
 of a better fate, and what is more, of the careful reading of 
 every farmer: 

When the Farmer knows, that a gato is better, and, as a 
 time-and-labor-saving fixture, cheaper, than a sett of bars 
 and posts, and without calling on a carpenter he can himself 
 make one, Why don't he do it ? 

When he has no other fastenings to his gates and barn 
 doors than a stone rolled against them, and in a single even- 
 ing, after supper, is able to make a better one, -Why don't he 
 do it ? 

Or when he sees the boards dropping from his barns and 
 and out-buildings, and like heaps of rubbish lying in piles 
 about the premises, and need only nailing on again, Why 
 don't he do it ? 

Or if he is afraid of the expense of nails, and is always 
 crying up the maxim of Dr. Franklin, to "save the pence 
 and the pounds will take care of themselves," and he knows 
 that the same Dr. Franklin also said that "many men are 
 penny wise and pound foolish," and he is not careful to 
 think of the precept contained in the latter, Why don't he do 
 it? 

If it is a saving of nearly half the manure of a farmer's 
 stock by keeping them shut up in yards, instead of running 
 at large through most of the winter, Why don't he do it ? 

If he knows that many of his fields would be greatly im- 
 proved by ditching, and by the removal of large stumps and 
 stones, Why don't he do it ? 

And when he knows that his pastures would yield nearly 
 double the feed, and of a better quality, if the bushes were 
 all cut and subdued, Why don't he do it ? 

And if he can add fifty per cent, to the product of his 
 clover-fields, and even his pastures, by the use of gypsum, 
 Why don't he do it ? 

If a farmer of fifty acres has (as he should have) use for a 
 good corn-sheller and one of the many improved fanning 
 mills, and he has not already obtained both, Why don't he 
 do it t 

And if it is cheaper, actually cheaper, to burn dry wood 

than green, and to use a stove instead of an open fire-place, 

Why don't he do it ?

The Oregon Pea. 

BY A. ROZEFL, OF LA YERGNE, TENNESSEE. 

The Oregon pea was brought a few years ago from Oregon 
 Territory. Whether it was found wild there, or was obtain- 
 ed from the Indians, I am not prepared to say. I obtained 
 from the State of Mississippi, a year ago last spring, about 
 a teaspoonful of seed, from the product of which I raised 
 last season thirty bushels of peas. Had it not been for the 
 cut-worm, the ravages of which were very great, I would 
 have raised one hundred bushels. 

The seed of this plant is very small — less in size than that 
 of the "lady or sugar pea" — and of a pale green color, with 
 a white "hilum," or eye. It grows on a bush from five to 
 six feet high, with five or six large branches near the 

ground, and they, with the main stalk, put out other branch- 
 es, until the stalks would make a bunch as large round as a 
 tobacco hogshead, or near it. It grows more like cotton 
 than any thing else I know of, only it is much larger, with 
 branches not so horizontal. After leaving the ground a 
 little, all these branches, with those which put out at every 
 joint, bear from four to ten pods in a bunch, with about fif- 
 teen peas in a pod, which as an article of food, are superior 
 to any thing of the kind I over ate. 

The stalks and loaves, which are very large and beautiful, 
 make perhaps the finest hay in the world — stock preferring 
 it to any other — and yield a greater abundance. The hay 
 and pea together, are a better and cheaper food than can be 
 raised from any thing else in the United States, for horses, 
 mules, cattle, sheep, and hogs. I believe I can raise more 
 and better feed for my stock, from one acre of land, than 
 I can from five of any thing else I know of. It will grow 
 on land so poor that it will produce little or nothing else ; 
 and tolerably poor land is better for it, and will produce 
 more than rich land. This may appear strange to some, but 
 it is nevertheless true. Rich land will produce more stalks, 
 but not so many peas ; in this respect it is like cotton. As 
 an improver of the soil, I consider it far superior to clover, 
 or any thing known in Tennessee, when fed otf on the 
 ground and then ploughed in. 

If seed is the object one has in view in raising this plant, 
 let it be sown in drills 4J feet apart, one or two seeds in a 
 place, one foot asunder along each drill. In the course of 
 the summer, weed and cultivate with the plough or hoe, 
 after the manner of raising bush-beans or Indian corn. 
 For fodder or hay sow them broadcast, and lightly harrow 
 them in, like wheat or other grain. 

In short, taking this plant altogether, it is one of the finest 
 and richest productions I ever saw ; and I am satisfied in 
 my own mind that it is the greatest acquisition to the far- 
 mers of the valley of the Mississippi, and the States adja- 
 cent, that has been introduced into this country — guano not 
 excepted — for the last thirty years. — Pat. Off. Report 1853.

A Premium Orchard and Orchard Trees. 

The Oneida Co. Agricultural Society awardod a premium 
 of $15 to Jona. Talcott of Rome, for his orchard of 385 
 trees, the largest of which were planted in 1849, and are 
 now sixteen inches in circumference. The following state- 
 ment is from the report of the Society : — The land on which 
 Mr. Talcott's orchard is planted, is mostly a sandy or grav- 
 elly loam with a clay subsoil. Previous to planting, it was 
 plowed in back furrows, and the holes were dug along the 
 ridges, thirty feet apart, three feet in width, and eighteen 
 inches deep. In each hole was put a large wheelbarrow 
 load of compost, made of stable-manure, lime, ashes and 
 muck, under cover the year before. In planting the trees, 
 surface soil was placed about the roots. The orchard ground 
 has been cultivated to hoed crops. Once a year the trees 
 have been pruned, and washed with strong soap-suds, a 
 woolen cloth being used for this purpose. This washing 
 has given the stems a clean, healthy look, and has tended 
 to keep away the insects. At the approach of winter the 
 soil has been heaped up about a foot around the trees. This 
 kept away the mice." 

Pure Air. 
 During extreme cold weather, every effort is usually made 
 to keep out the cold, and sometimes so successfully as to 
 render the atmosphero in stove rooms and chambers abso- 
 lutely hurtful. Pure air, winter or summer, is necessary to 
 insure health. A cool bed room is better than a debilitated 
 body.
