sovereign. But Science comes to rescue the powerless king 
 from his misery and degradation. Gradually he learns from 
 her the laws of his empire, and the means hy which his re- 
 bel subjects may be conquered. From age to age he accu- 
 mulates the knowledge that clothes him with power, and 
 fills his heart with courage. Step after step he mounts up- 
 ward to the throne which God commissioned him to do ho- 
 mage. The subjugated elements own him for their lord, 
 yield him their fealty, and become the servants of his will. 
 The mine surrenders its treasures; the wilderness blooms 
 around him like a new Eden; tho rivers and sea bear his 
 wealth upon their bosom; the winds waft his navies round 
 the globe; steam, the joint product of fire and water, be- 
 comes his obedient and powerful slave; the sunbeams are 
 trained to do his painting; the lightning leaps away to 
 carry his messages; and the earth works with ceaseless ac- 
 tivity to bring forth whatever can minister to his gratifi- 
 cation. 

Let your imaginations carry you back to the time when 
 agriculture was in its infancy — before the earliest dawn of 
 Greek civilization. In those days men depended principal- 
 ly upon the chase for a living. They ate the flesh, and 
 clothed themselves with the skins of wild beasts. Fruits 
 and other vegetables of spontaneous growth added to their 
 luxuries in summer. They were not long in discovering 
 one fundamental law of nature, namely: that seeds deposited 
 in the ground would grow, and produce similar seeds in 
 larger quantities. But they knew nothing of the differ- 
 ence between one soil and another. They preferred the 
 poorest, because it was easiest cleared and lying higher up 
 on the ridges, it needed no draining. Here they made 
 holes in the ground with sticks, and dropped the seeds a 
 few inchos below tho surface. The rest was left to nature. 
 If such cultivation gave them a two or three fold crop, they 
 were lucky. It happened much oftener that its growth was 
 choked with weeds, or that it met with some other evil 
 chance, by which 

•'The green corn perished e're his youth attained a beard." 
 The planting and gathering were left to women and chil- 
 dren; the men despised such work, as being inconsistent 
 with their honor and dignity. Hunting and fighting wero 
 the employments in which they found pleasure and glory, 
 as well as food and clothing. But there was one man 
 among them more thoughtful and observant than all the 
 rest. He had watched the unfolding vegetation, from the 
 sprouting of the seed to the maturity of the fruit, with a 
 keen perception of the whole marvelous and beautiful pro- 
 cess; and he devoted his attention to the roaring of use- 
 ful grains, with a pleasure, which he had never felt in the 
 excitement of the chaso. He discovered the proper season 
 for planting; he noticed that weeds were unfriendly to the 
 growth of his crops; he found that mixing certain substan- 
 ces, such as ashes and decomposed leaves, with the soil, 
 would increase its productiveness; he learned that stirring 
 the ground about the roots of a plant would make it thrive 
 more rapidly; he even got himself a kind of hoe made, by 
 some cunning worker in iron. Here was a philosopher, 
 whose intellectual stature rose high above that of his fol- 
 lows. Being a patriot also, and willing to do good for his 
 countrymen, he conceived the thought of persuading them 
 to quit hunting and win a surer living from the earth. At 
 his request, they assembled under the spreading oaks, to 
 hear his plans; and this was the first agricultural meeting — 
 I will not say the first on record, for I do not know that it is 
 recorded— but certainly the earliest you ever heard of. The 
 sage unfolded his new science to them, proving, as he went 
 along by tho facts of his own experience. The chase, ho 
 said, was a precarious business at best, while agriculture 
 would bo a sure and steadfast reliance. He told them, that 
 he himself, with the moderate labor of his own hands, had 
 gained in a single season, what would sustain life longer and 

better, than all the spoils taken, during the same time, by 
 the best ten of their hunters. This, he asserted, was true 
 of an ordinary season, but sometimes the game disappeared 
 entirely. His voice grew deeper, and its tones had a mel- 
 ancholy impressiveness, as he described the sufferings en- 
 dured by them all, when they, the strong sons of the wil- 
 derness, with their wives and children, became the prey of 
 gaunt famine and wide wasting pestilence. He concluded 
 by promising, that long lives of wealth and contentment 
 should repay them for a general devotion of their labor to 
 the cultivation of the earth. 

No cheers followed the speech, but on the contrary, hoarse 
 murmurs of disapprobation came up from the multitude, 
 swelling by degrees into loud opposition. The new measure 
 was attacked with all those shallow sophistries — these mis- 
 erable fallacies so shallow and truthless — with which conser- 
 vatism arms her ignorant votaries. That solitary defender 
 of truth was overwhelmed by the sort of arguments, which 
 are sometimes reproduoed in modern political meetings and 
 legislative bodies. Some accused him of a deep design upon 
 their liberties. Some declared that ho had opposed tho na- 
 tion in its last quarrel, and was, in fact, no better than a 
 traitor. One set know him to be unsound in his religious 
 faith, and brought all the prejudices of superstition into tho 
 field against him. Others charged dowu upon him with a 
 whole army of "illustrious ancestors," whose opinions, they 
 said, were not like his. Others still there were, who could 
 see no objection to the man or the measure, but this was not 
 tho proper occasion — the time was out of joint, A portion 
 of the crowd saw, in their much wisdom, that to quit hunting 
 would enervate their frames and make them a race of cow- 
 ards. Most powerful of all, and most profoundly wise in 
 their own conceit, was tho party who declared they would 
 never consent to the enormous sacrifice of property required 
 by such an innovation. They had invested a large capital 
 in bows, and arrows, and spears, and traps, and knives; and 
 these would all bo useless if their future occupation was to 
 consist in tilling the ground. There was one mighty man 
 there; a blacksmith, who had gained great consequence, 
 and earned innumerable skins, by making the weapons which 
 were used in killing the beasts of the forest. He thought his 
 craft was in danger, and he objected to Agriculture, for tho 
 same reason that Demetrius, the silversmith, afterwards op- 
 posed Christianity. He put an end to all discussion, by ut- 
 tering a catchword, with just enough of no meaning in it 
 to make his friends unanimous. Ho lifted up his big voice, 
 and cried out "Great is Diana tho Goddess of the bow, and 
 the Patroness of hunters." The whole assembly in full 
 chorus echoed the cry — and there was a great uproar. 
 They would have stoned their prophet; for the sight of his 
 meek countenance and tho recollection of his blameless life 
 exasperated their wrath; but no one proposed it, and he 
 was suffered to escape. 

The primitive apostle of agricultural science was defeated. 
 He died in tho melancholy belief, that his people were des- 
 tined to remain forever in barbarism. But not so. A truth 
 had been spoken; and truth can never die. It had gone 
 down in the shock of the first encounter with falsehood, but 
 it was not crushed. Agriculture found an efficient champion 
 where such a thing could least have been expected. At 
 the great meeting under the trees, there was a littlo girl, 
 whose parents had both died of starvation, and her two 
 brothers had perished in the pestilence, which followed the 
 famine. Hunger and its concomitants had carried away 
 every relative she ever had. She was gifted by nature with 
 a quick intellect and a kind heart; and her lonely condition 
 had made her thoughtful and wise above her years. She 
 listened to the words of the sage with beaming eye, and 
 flushed cheek, and lips parted in breathless interest. When 
 she heard a proposal to furnish bread in abundance — broad 
 at all times — bread which would always stay the ravages of 
 famine, whether game was plenty or scarce — it roused every
