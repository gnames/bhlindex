THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[January 

new under the sun." Let the worthy farmer and mechanic 
 be stimulated at what ho sees around us; let him bo emula- 
 ted thereby and endeavor to advance his calling. The Hon- 
 orable jud^e, the lawyer, the doctor and the divine, all take 
 an interest in our welfare; the Government itself begins to 
 shake off its lethargic stupor, and seems willing to grant a 
 email pittanee to the aid of the scientific and practical farmer. 

Cheap Kindlings. 
 The Genesee Farmer gives the following directions for 

making a cheap and serviceable kindling for wood firos : 

Take a quart of tar and three pounds of rosin, melt them, 
 bring to a cooling temperature, mix with as much saw-dust, 
 with a little charcoal added, as can be worked in ; spread 
 out while hot upon a board ; when cold, break up into lumps 
 of the size of a large hickory nut, and you have at a small 
 expense, kindling material enough for a household for one 
 year. They will easily ignite from a match, and burn with 
 a strong blaze, long enough to start any wood that is fit to 
 burn. 

THOROUGH BRED DURHAM BULL 1ST LORD BARRINGTON. 

This animal was bred by Thomas P. Remington, Esq., 
 of Philadelphia, and is now owned by Dennis Kelly, 
 Esq., of Delaware county. Lord Barrington 1st took 
 the first premium at the late Pennsylvania State Exhi- 
 bition for the best bull between two and three years old. 
 He is one of the best animals in the State, and closely 
 descended, as will be perceived, from the celebrated 
 Duchess blood, now so much sought for. In length and 
 depth of carcass, great width of loin and back, and es- 
 pecially in being well filled up behind the shoulders, he 
 is superior to most others. His stock from the right 
 kind of cows, we should suppose, would be much sought 
 for. He is highly creditable to his breeder and. present 
 owner. 

He was calved January 18th, 1852; color, red and 
 white; dam. Lady Barrington 4th by Bates Bull Meteor: 
 sire, Fortune by Bates Bull Symmetry: gr. dam, Lady 
 Ban-ingtcn 3d by Duchess Bull Cleveland Lad, No. 3407,

Meteor was by imported Duke of Wellington, bred by 
 the late Thomas Bates, Esq., of Kirkleavington, England; 
 got by Duchess Bull Short-Tail, 2621, E. H. B.; dam, Ox- 
 ford. Oxford obtained the first prize for the best Short- 
 Horned cow, open to all England, in July, 1839, at the 
 Royal Agricultural Society's Exhibition. The dam of 
 Meteor was imported Duchess, also bred by the late 
 Thomas Bates, Esq. 

Ruby, the dam of Fortune, was awarded the first prize 
 in 1850 by the New York State Agricultural Society in 
 class of milch cows, being a thorough bred improved
