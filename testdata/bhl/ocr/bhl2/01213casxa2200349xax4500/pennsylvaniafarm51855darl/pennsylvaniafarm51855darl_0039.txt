Plowing in Guano. 

A correspondent of the Country Gentleman, in reply to 
 an inquiry as to the best method of applying guano on 
 clay land says: 

I have tried it on clay land that had been in grass for 
 five years. On one half the field I plowed it to the depth 
 of seven inches, and on the other half harrowed it in, and 
 planted it all to corn, and staked off an equal number of 
 hills from each part. It all came up equally well, but 
 by the early part of summer there was a marked diffe- 
 rence in the two parts of the field, which continued 
 throughout the season ; and upon husking, that which 
 had been plowed in [and staked off upon planting,] pro- 
 duced nine bushels, while that which had been harrowed 
 in, produced but five bushels, showing the advantage of 
 plowing it in, even in heavy clay soil. The soil was a 
 slate and the amount used about two hundred lbs. to the 
 acre. 

Standard Weight of Grain and Seeds. 
 For the convenience of our readers, and in answer to 
 numerous enquiries, we annex below the standard weight 
 of numerous articles of Farm produce, which in the in- 
 tercourse of trade, it is of importance to have well under- 
 stood both by buyers and sellers.

Work for the Month. 

Farm: — Stock demands the careful attention of farm- 
 ers at this season. They should be kept thriving — not 
 barely living. They should have shelter to protect them 
 from the inclemency of the weather. Cows should be 
 kept housed at night in warm, well ventilated stables. 
 All stables should be frequently cleaned, daily if possi- 
 ble. The curry-comb and card should be used freely. 
 Milch cows, (and other cattle when practicable) should 
 have a daily supply of succulent food such as roots, cab- 
 bage, fee., with a little meal. Do not allow any stock to 
 suffer for want of food or water. Keep a lump of rock 
 salt where they can lick it at pleasure. 

Do what hauling circumstances will permit now, and 
 you will have so much less to do in the busy season, 
 such as lime and other fertilizers, wood, stone. &c. It is 

better to work the teams in pleasant weather than to 
 permit them to stand idle all winter. Sheep should have 
 shedding not stables to run under to protect them from 
 the rains, and should be fed a little oats or corn daily, 
 and when necessary hay. When the ground is free from 
 snow they generally are able to gain most of their nour- 
 ishment from the pasture field. Swine should have good 
 shelter, but not too "closely housed." Poultry should 
 have access to a warm house, with some refuse meat, sand, 
 ashes and lime always at hand. They make a rich re- 
 turn for this little attention. 

Fruit Orchard: — Remove all long grass and rubbish 
 from trees, which attract mice. Bank up earth as be- 
 fore recommended. Arrange plan of orchard and fruit 
 garden for spring planting; select at this leisure season, 
 from fruit books and other sources, what varieties will 
 probably be wanted; provide fencing materials, and have 
 them ready for early use; cut down worn out and decayed 
 apple trfees ; provide stakes and tallies for trees ; plant 
 the orchard on paper in winter, at leisure, and thus ex- 
 pedite business in the spring; spread lime over old or- 
 chards; moderate pruning may be attended. in this month; 
 dig in guano or short manure, to promote vigorous 
 growth. 

Vegetable Garden: — Attend to directions of last 
 month ; keep a close watch on frames, so as not to force 
 into growth or injure by exposure; attend to composts and 
 procure materials for forcing beds in spring; repair sash, 
 and make mats of straw for covering in cold nights; 
 provide a full supply of bean poles, pea sticks, &c; pro- 
 cure what gardening tools may be wanted, and antici- 
 pate the working season. 

Flower Garden:— If the hints given out the previous 
 month have been attended to, there will be little to do 
 this month in the flower garden. Protection should be 
 given at once to all tender roses and shrubs requiring it. 
 Plants in windows should be carefully watched, and 
 avoid too frequent watering. A good watering when ne- 
 cessary is much better than constant wetting. That 
 pest, the Green Fly, can be kept under by occasionally 
 syringing or immersing in tobacco water made by steep- 
 ing tobacco stems in water for twenty four hours, or what 
 is better of water of aloes. 

Orange and Lemon trees in cellar, should have fresh 
 air admitted when weather is open; water only when 
 dry. Plants in cold frame should have air every fine 
 day. They are very liable to be injured by excess of 
 moisture. 

Too Much Land. 

Mr. Darlington:' — There are few farmers, I appre- 
 hend, who will agree with me when I say that in nine 
 cases out of ten, they have too much land. A farm of 
 one hundred or one hundred and fifty acres is considered 
 of a moderate size, and so comparatively it is; but there 
 are few tracts of these dimensions, unless in the grazing 
 districts, that are thoroughly cultivated. By thorough- 
 ly cultivated, I mean, made to produce their maximum 
 quantity of profitable produce. 

Thirty years ago-, farms were generally on an average 
 double the size of these in our day; and thirty years ago 
 fifty bushels of corn per acre, was considered a large 
 yield. Now, either the farm or the farming is indifferent
