Just Principles of Breeding. 

Mr. Darlington : — With the exception of a few profess- 
 ional breeders, but little attention is paid, in this county 
 to breeding. Its plainest principles are almost entirely dis- 
 regarded. Breeding ''in and in" as it is called or from"near 
 relations" is so common with some kind of stock, as to be 
 almost universal; while old, broken down animals, which 
 are lit for nothing else (and most of all unfit for this) are 
 kept for no other purpose. Has a farmer an old, limping, 
 wheezing mare, too rickety to work, he takes care to get two 
 or three colts from her before sending her to the tanners; 
 has he a herd of cows, the male progeny of one or more of 
 these is yearly raised, to serve, among other, his own daugh- 
 ter, and perhaps granddaughter; has he a flock of sheep, 
 five or six years is generally sufficient to render it worthless; 
 has he a lot of hogs, they are probably the unmixed descen- 
 dants of a pair ho had ten years before. All this most of 
 theui know, or should know is wrong. It is against the 
 laws of nature for an old, broken down mare, to produce a 
 healthy offspring; nor can the continuous offspring of noar 
 connections bo expected to be robust and strong. The size 
 an 1 beauty will be diminished while the liability to disease 
 will be increased. These facts are so well established that 
 it would be folly to cite cases in their proof. 

To every farmer who has occasion to raise a colt, a calf, 
 a lamb or a pig, or indeed any animal, I would say, first; 
 see that the intended parents are hoalthy, and neither very 
 young nor in the decline of life, second; that they arc not 
 near relations, third; that the intended dam be "well used" 
 after conception. These are the first requisites. 

The careful farmer will also be anxious to breed so as to 
 obtain secular points iu his stock. This he can generally 
 attain, by tho selection of stock to breed from. He can at 
 teats approximate to the size or figure sought and may at- 
 tain it in time by careful breeding. J. G. CROSS.

Wanted — Seeds of Plants. 

ulr. J. L. Darlington: — Having for some time been try- 
 in ;• without success to obtain seeds of the following named 
 ph ..;;. which, though' some of them may not be new are 
 i:"- i u'uh-ated in this section of country so far as I am 
 am • to learn. I have therefore been induced to ask, if 
 either yourselves or any of your numerous exchanges or 
 subsdribefs could inform me of the whereabouts they can be 
 obtained* if so I shall feel myself much obliged for their in- 
 formation. HORTICOLA. 

/.',•' infills S«l<lariffa; This plant is largely cultivated in 
 the West Indies and some parts of Europe, under the name 
 of French Sorrel, where the calyx and large capsules are 
 used for making a cooling and aciduous beverage, and pre- 
 pared with sugar they are said to rival the cranberry in 
 taste. The plant is nearly related to Okra (Hibiscus escu- 
 leni i and may be cultivated in the same way. 

Oxali* vrnmta ■ Kenrick says this is a perrennial, or- 
 namental plant discovered by Douglas in Chili. The roots 
 »r tuber's are produced in clusters, their taste when boiled 
 what resembles a chesnut. They are raised from the 

tnliers and being extraordinary productive, they are as 
 easily cultivated as the potatoe, but decidedly superior in 
 flavor; they require a rich soil and like the potatoe may bo 
 stored during the winter in cellars. 

Oregon Pea ; I do not know the botanical name of this 
 plant, but probably it is not a Pisum, as it is said to be a 
 stiff, upright, branching plant, and very prolific when thinly 
 planted, which it should be when seeds are the object, which, 
 when green aro said to be an excellent table vegetable,, and 
 when dry are valuable for horses, swine, and poultry, which 
 last would be something in these shanghai days of ours 
 When thickly sown it makes a good fodder plant: 

Cicer arietipiun, Chick Pea ; This is the garbanza of tho 
 Spaniards and Poischicho of the Fronch. Evjebson says, 
 it grows well in the Middle states. In the West Indies and 
 in every part of America which is settled by the Spaniards, 
 they have always made the culture of the garbanza a pri- 
 mary object; it is singular it has not become better known 
 and appreciated in the United States. Trials made with il 
 in the vicinity of Dover, Delaware, proved very successful. 
 It is considered the most delicious vegetable of its class evei 
 placed on the table when served in tho manner of green 
 peas. It does not Yield so abundantly as the eommon pea 
 but it is decidedly superior both in richness and flavor; 
 and not being the prey of insects they will keep sound and 
 sweet for years. They grow best in a rich sandy loam, and 
 not being a trailing vine, requires no sticks, the plant grow- 
 ing only about 18 or 20 inches high and very branching. 

Homespun Gossipping. 
 To the Printer of the Farm Journal :— Don't be alarmed, 
 Mr. Printer, at the formidable appearance of along gossiping 
 letter from a hard-working old farmer. If you can't puzzle 
 out my rheumatic looking quill-tracks, why you may light your 
 pipo with the paper, or you can send it to the printer of tho 
 Examiner at Lancaster, he will spell them out for you without 
 missing a word. Years ago I used to have many a long chat 
 with the Examiner, but my rheumatic old fingers got rebell- 
 ious at last and put a stop to my gossipings with him, and I 
 have had so little to do with pen and ink ever since, that I 
 calculate it will bother you to cypher out my seratchings, 
 even with the help of all the dictionaries about your estab- 
 lishment. But, Mr. Printer, I have intended for a long time 
 to have a talk with you Farm Journal folks, so this morning 
 I said to my good old wife, (I never do anything without 
 first consulting my wife, for after forty years experience I 
 have discovered that if a man wants to keep a clear consci- 
 ence and get ahead in the world he must make it a matter 
 of business to consult his wife,) so says I, "Becky, I believe 
 I will write a letter to the printer of the Fa>-m Journal." 
 "Bless my heart, Homespun, (Becky always calls me by my 
 last name) bless my heart," says she, "what has put that no- 
 tion in your head ?" "Why I must send him my dollar for 
 the next volume," I replied, "and I may as well tell him what 
 we think of his Journal at Homespun Hall." "Well," says 
 Becky, "You used to tell the printer of tho Examiner so many 
 things about housekeeping and our way of managing here, 
 that I really felt ashamed to call at his office for our paper 
 when I went to market, and now, if you are going to gossip 
 about us.to the printer of the Farm Journal, I shall never 
 show my face in West Chester, and you know very well you 
 promised to take me over there next spring to replenish my 
 stock of plants and roses at Morris's nursery." ■ "Well, my 
 good old wife," I replied, "I scare ly ever pick up a newspaper 
 in which somebody is not boasting of his fine stock, his 
 large crops, or some such thing; and as it is my good for- 
 tune to have a model of a wife, I don't see why I can't keep 
 myself iu a good humor with the world by lttting the world
