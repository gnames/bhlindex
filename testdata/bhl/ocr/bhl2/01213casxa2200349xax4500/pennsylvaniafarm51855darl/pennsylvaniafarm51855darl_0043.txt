and eloquent appeals ever made to that body in the form of 
 a memorial, exhorted them in the name of Washington, in 
 the name of agriculture, in the name of the American people, 
 to purchase the hallowed and consecrated ground of Mount 
 Vernon, and dedicate it to the cause of the diffusion of agri- 
 cultural knowledge. And yet Congress pauses. Five mil- 
 lions of agriculturists appeal in vain for so small a boon ! 
 Represented through their societies, organized throughout al- 
 most every county of the Union, with State associations, and 
 a national association, their annual gatherings already con- 
 stituting the great national gala days of the country, with an 
 agricultural press already read by half a million voters 
 paying the taxes of the country, constituting three-fourths 
 of the people of the country, and Congress gives to agricul- 
 ture no bureau, no department, no institution of learning; 
 they know us but to tax us. In the moral world a just retri- 
 bution is visited upon acts of omission, as well as upon acts 
 of commission. The agriculturists have but to combine to 
 punish such slighting of their claims, such overslaughing of 
 of themselves and their interests, and insure more faithful 
 work. The day of reckoning may bo at hand. 

It must be said, however, in reference to the memorial 
 presented by Mr. Blair and others, for the purchase of Mount 
 Vernon, and the establishment of an agricultural school and 
 model farm, in connection with the Smithsonian Institution, 
 that General Morton, of the Sonate's Committee on the sub- 
 ject, made a very able and satisfactory report, and it is to be 
 hoped the measure will be promptly acted on at the ap- 
 proaching session of Congress. 

And what a course of training this would afford to the 
 youth of the country! The farmers of my own little State 
 came forward recently to make up a balance of a fund of 
 $50,000 for the establishment of an agricultural department 
 in connection with Delaware College, at Newark. The re- 
 sult is, that on the first day of this month forty-three young 
 gentlemen entered that institution, being twice the average 
 number for the last several years, coming from Georgia, 
 South Carolina, Maine, representing in all ten States. 

Maryland, also, moved thereto by one who is always first 
 to move, and the most efficient to move in every good cause 
 connected with agriculture, Charles B. Calvert, Esq., is ta- 
 king steps towards the establishment of an agricultural col- 
 lege. 

Enter, then, your sons. Sound in their ears the exhorta- 
 tion of the father of Daniel Webster to his son, as they 
 were resting from their labors on a hay-cock in the meadow; 
 "Get learning, my son, got learning!" and the father was 
 ready to make any sacrifice to this end. 

"I remember," says Webster, "the very hill which wo 
 were ascending, through deep snows in a New England 
 sleigh, when my father first made known his purpose of sen- 
 ding me to college. I could not speak. How could he, I 
 thought, with so large a family and in such narrow circum- 
 stances, think of incurring so groat an expense for me. A 
 warm glow run all over me, and I laid upon my father's 
 shoulder and wept." 

Our children will remember the sacrifices we make for 
 them, and bless our memories for it; nay, they will, as they 
 relate such sacrifices, let our voices be heard above our 
 graves. 

For the training of our sons, so far as their physical for- 
 mation is concerned, how favorable are our country homes, 
 and the sports, laoors, and exercise they induce ! Nor is the 
 acene less favorable to their moral culture, where, remote 
 from temptation, they behold in everything that surrounds 
 them the works of nature, 

"And look through nature up to nature's God." 
 Their intellect, then, must be addressad through the schools 

and the collegos, while everywhere they must learn the pre- 
 cepts of our blessod religion, and seek to excel in the prac- 
 tice of every Christian virtue. Train, then, you mothers. 
 Train in the name of Washington! Begin with the anec- 
 dote of his childhood, when the father said to the child six 
 years old, after questioning all his servants, "George, did 
 you cut the pear tree in the garden? The reply was, 
 "Father, I can't tell a lie ; it was I that did it.

Wheat Trade. 

The estimated extra breadth sown in the United Kingaora 
 last season is one-tenth above the average, equal to 1,600,000 
 quarters. On the other hand, there is an excess of produce 
 above the average of from one-sixth to one-eighth. Taking 
 the mean of one-seventh, our account of the presont crop 
 and stock stands as follows : 

Quarters. 

Average produce, 16,000,000 

Excess in breadth one-tenth, 1,600,000 

17,600,000 
 Excess of produce ono-seventh, 2,514,285 

Quarters, 20,114,285 

If to this we add one million and a half of foreign grain, 
 we have an aggregate of 21,614,285 quarters to meet the 
 consumption of the year, which is estimated at 21,000,000. 
 There will still, however, be the usual stock of the country 
 — now minus 5,000,000 quarters — to be made up. For it 
 would bo monstrous to suppose that in a country like this, 
 there should be no stock on hand to fall back upon in an 
 emergency. We shall, therefore, require an importation this 
 year of from four to five million quarters, to place us in the 
 average condition we have hitherto found ourselves in, in 
 regard to tho stock of wheat. 

We shall next take a look round, and seek how this supply 
 is to be obtained. As we have just stated, any calculations 
 for the future, founded upon the experience of tho past, are 
 not to be depended on. With present appearances, it is not 
 at all likely that we shall obtain the usual supply from the 
 Black Sea ports, even if the Danube is free to navigation, 
 and the Crimea anl Odessa were in tho possession of the 
 allies — as I hope will soon be the case. Tho consumption 
 and waste of such large armaments, and the disarrangement 
 of commerce and agriculture under tho iron rule of war, to 
 say nothing of the probable prohibition of the Czar to his 
 subjects from supplying the allies, or conducting commeroe 
 with thorn from the interior— all these circumstances lead 
 me to think that the quantity of wheat we shall obtain from 
 Southern Russia this season will be small. And with re- 
 spect to the Danubian Principalities, they have been for 
 twelve months tho seat of war, and are still occupied with 
 vast armaments. Under the Russian coercive domination, 
 neither agriculture nor commerce could be conducted with 
 any regularity ; and it is probable that not only was a large 
 portion of the land left unsown last autumn, but that much 
 of tho growing crop has been destroyed by military opera- 
 tions, and in furnishing the Russian cavalry with green food; 
 for no economic considerations would, by any possibility, en- 
 ter the mind of a Russian officer. We shall, therefore, have 
 much less grain than usual from the Danubian and other 
 Turkish Black Sea ports, if we get any at all, which is very 
 doubtful. 

Frc:n the Mediterranean ports, with the exception of 
 Egypt and Syria, we shall obtain but little wheat. France 
 and Italy are, for the present, closed against exportation by 
 prohibitory laws. The former country, and the United King- 
 dom, has exhausted her stocks of old native wheat, and is
