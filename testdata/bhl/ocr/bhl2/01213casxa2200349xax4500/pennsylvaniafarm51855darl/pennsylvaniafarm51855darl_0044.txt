THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[January 

compelled to fall at once upon the new crop, which, however 
 good, will not be enough to meet the consumption, and pro- 
 vide tin' usual reserve stock. It is probable that France and 
 England will continue, as last year, to trade mutually with 
 each other in wheat, according as the market fluctuates. If 
 the price falls here below that in France, the latter will be 
 buyers in our market, and vice versa. 

With regard to the Baltic and northern countries, with the 
 exception of Russia, the stocks of old wheat are exhausted. 
 Not only had the merchants the stimulus of high prices to 
 induce them to ship to the utmost, but the insecurity, and 
 the uncertainty as to what course the war would take, in- 
 duced them to export to the last quarter to England and 
 France, as the only countries where it would both be safe, 
 and obtain remunerating prices. The crops in those coun- 
 tries are good, and we shall probably get an average quan- 
 tity from thence, if no untoward events cause a blockade of 
 the Baltic ports 

We now come to the United States of America ; and if the 
 accounts of the maize crop — and wheat, also, in some parts 
 of the Union — be correct, their prices will probably be too 
 high this season to allow of their shipping more at any rate 
 than tho usual quantity this season. It is stated in the 
 American papers, that the corn crop(maize) is at least one- 
 fourth deficient, which amounts to 125,000,000 bushels, or 
 15,625,000 quarters. And, with regard to wheat, in some of 
 the Western States, where the largest quantity is raised, the 
 crop is very deficient — in many cases amounting to a total 
 failure. To what extent this may be the case, it is impossi- 
 ble to say; but, taking the deficiency in both crops into ac- 
 count, it will materially affect the export of wheat from the 
 States, and also, probably, draw off a considerable portion of 
 the supplies from Canada, where the crop is represented to 
 be excellent. 

Under these circumstances, I e stimate supplies for the 
 next year as follows : 

Quarters. 

The Northern ports, 1,750,000 

Mediterranean, 500,000 

Black Sea do, 300,000 

United States, 800,000 

Canada, 400,000 

3.750,000 
 This may probably be made up to four millions from tho 
 quarters that do not come under the sections above given ; 
 but I cannot, by any possibility, see where we can increase 
 that quantity, unless "a sudden transition from war to 
 pence" should restore our northern trade to its accustomed 
 channels. However, with this quantity added to the abun- 
 dant crop, wo shall be able to reinstate the country in nearly 
 the same condition as to stock, that it has usually held; and 
 we need not fear that prices will materially fluctuate through- 
 out the season. — Mark Lane Express. 

Wheat vs. Cheat. 
 Mr. Darlingtox: — I stated in my last communication 
 upon this subject, that I did not doubt a word which Mr. 
 Miller had given as fact; nor do I now feel disposed in the 
 least, to charge him with "being aware" of propagating an 
 erroneous principal. I only ask permission to lay aside his 
 "conclusion" until a more thorough investigation shall have 
 been made of a subject of so much importance to agn^iil 
 ture; and I think the readers of [he Farm Journal will agree 
 with mo, that tho danger of lulling tho minds of many into 
 the belief that it is useless to clean their seed, while Nature 
 is so treacherous as annually to produce vast quantities of 
 "cheat wheat" from the seed of good honest wheat, will jus- 

tify this demand ; it is to repeat and urge this demand that 
 "I again take so much trouble" 

An error propagated with the kindest intentions, and even 
 by the most gentlo hand, is nevertheless an error, and even 
 the more dangerous. Mr. Miller contends that "chess is 
 nothing more nor less than stinted, shriveled, or dwarfish 
 wheat" — and would account for its change from good wheat 
 in the same way that he accounts for "diversity" in the hu- 
 man countenance, or human form." Does he mean that it 
 is a malformation? if so, we need only refer him to what 
 has been said about monsters; the same law of nature holds 
 good in both cases. If not, does he bear in mind that wheat 
 taken as a family (honest wheat I mean, without including 
 "cheat-wheat") comprises perhaps nearly as much variety of 
 "feature, form and complexion" as the human family, and 
 that with all these varieties (spring wheat excepted) under 
 various climates, in various atmospheres, and on various 
 soils, cheat wheat grows and flourishes with but very little 
 variation of "feature, form and complexion." I would ask the 
 Philosopher, does cheat spring from one kind of wheat only? 
 does each kind produce its "stinted, shrivelled' dwarfish" 
 grains and its large flourishing, branching heads of the same 
 shape, form, feature, and complexion ? or have the different 
 varieties annually conspired to produce an outcast so vile, 
 and yet so faithful and able-bodied as to stand by each indi- 
 vidual branch of the family through good and evil, with so 
 little variation of form, &o. 

As for cheat being u sui generis," I never undertook to 
 prove it by botanical rules.* The columns of the Farm Jour- 
 nal, I believe, are not open to discussions on botany. It is 
 "facts from experience" tho Editor asks of practical farmers. 
 As this is not the season for pratical investigation in botany, 
 I must bog leave to answer Mr. Miller in the words of 
 Gay's Shepherd : 

"The little knowledge I have gained 
 Was all troni simple nature drained." 

I have for a number of years been cultivating wheat and 
 cheat side by side for experiment, but have not been able to 
 find any traces of consanguinity, nor, as yet, to induce them 
 to show any affinity, whatever, for each other; nor does it 
 appear at all probable that they can be induced to mix 
 without an absolute outrage upon the laws of nature, produ- 
 cing a monster which will not continue. Such seems to 
 have been the case in "wheat and oats," while the forming of 
 wheat and oats upon tho same stalk was certainly the work 
 of nature ; the cause theroof seems just as certainly to have 
 been an outrage upon the laws of nature, and whether com- 
 mitted by bee or butterfly, or some other innocent trans- 
 gressor, the rareness of the occurrence seems to justify the 
 idea that it was done by violence, and that the penalty at- 
 tached is "Thy seed shall perish and not continue." 

We have no desire to "substitute conjecture for analogy," 
 nor do we think the public will be willing in all cases to take 
 assertion for proof. "Tho fact that cheat is seldom found 
 oxcept when growing among wheat," is a mere assertion. 
 If Mr. M. will come to this neighborhood wo will show it 
 to him growing in the fields, meadows and woods; thus pro- 
 ducing strong circumstantial evidence that it is indigenous 
 in our soil, and like other native weeds, continually creeping 
 into our fields where it is not wanted. If he is a farmer ho 
 certainly knows that it grows with rye, with this difference 
 only, that rye producing a larger and stronger plant than 
 wheat is more able both to keep it dow^ <tnu 10 nide it ; the 
 reason why it does not grow among spring crops is too ob- 
 vious to need any comment 

Mr. M. admits that I asked the question, "who has ever 
 seen a single stalk of wheat turn to cheat," but in reply 
 evades a direct answer by saying, "every person who has 
 seen a stalk of cheat wheat has seen that which has turned
