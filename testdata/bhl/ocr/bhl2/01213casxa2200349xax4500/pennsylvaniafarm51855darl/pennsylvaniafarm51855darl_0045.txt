from wheat." By this prevarication he putsine to the ne- 
 cessity of asking when this change has taken place. If he 
 would prove his position by "analogy" by referring us to the 
 time when Father Adam's rib changed into a woman, I have 
 nothing more to say. But if he means to signify that the 
 cheat which I have been carefully cultivating in my garden, 
 and closely watching, has within the last seven years sprung 
 from good wheat, I must demand stronger proof of an opti- 
 cal illusion than his theory of analogy has yet produced. 

I did not state in the June number of the Farm Journal, 
 that I had found oats growing out of a sheaf of wheat. It 
 -.v:is out of a head of wheat, and I thought all would under- 
 stand that I related the circumstance on account of the anal- 
 ogy existing between that and the "cheat and wheat," said 
 to have been produced upon the same stalk by Prof. Mapes. 
 As I did not make my ideas as plain as I ought to have 
 done, I am obliged to Mr. M. for carrying them a little 
 farther ; but why does he not continue unto "something con- 
 clusive," thiit as wheat does not turn to oats neither is their 
 much danger "by analogy" of it turning to cheat. "Mr. S. 
 has not yet been called upon to execute a deed for his farm 
 in accordance with his own proposition." The "wager of a 
 farm" was no wager at all. I stated that a neighbor had 
 undertaken to change some wheat which I had growing in 
 my garden into cheat, for which service I promised to give 
 him nay farm and stock when the job was completed ; but 
 finding himself too weak in faith in his own doctrine he 
 never attended to it. I did, however, carefully follow his 
 directions, but could not produce a grain of cheat from 
 plants of wheat. That neighbor was S. P. Bromley, of this 
 town, and can be addressed by mail. My object with Mr. 
 'Bromley was to bring a fair experiment before my neigh- 
 ,:. ay of whom are believers in Mr. Miller's science. 
 As 1 have failed in that, I would like Mr. M. or any body 
 else tu inform me how I may certainly change good wheat 
 into "cheat wheat," alias cheat or chess. All admit that 
 nature is governed by certain laws, (or does Mr. M. contend 
 we are in a world of chance,) and if there is a law, or an 
 "extraneous cause," for producing this change, somebody 
 ought to be acquainted with it; and if there is a law for 
 changing cheat to wheat, (its present stock, as they contend,) 
 that is, of all laws, the one under which we would most like 
 to pettifog. 

While waiting for this information permit me to relate, 
 for the benefit of those who choose to road them, a few ex- 
 periments which I have been trying. One says "late sow- 
 ing produces cheat." On the 20th of October, 1853, I 
 planted in my garden, carefully staked, and registered on 
 my book, a row of wheat and a row of cheat, side by side, 
 and treated precisely alike. By the first of April every 
 plant of the wheat had perished, while the cheat flourished 
 and ripened a heavy crop. I planted side by side, and wat- 
 ered in cold weather, for the purpose to winter kill. The 
 wheat all perished, but the cheat grew and ripened finely. 
 Mr. M. says "drought or some other cause." On the first of 
 August, 1854, 1 planted wheat and cheat. All vegetated and 
 came up, but from the excessive "drought," or "some other 
 cause," unknown to me, every plant of the wheat has per- 
 ished, while the cheat is in a flourishing condition and pro- 
 mises a fine harvest. Those who will can try the above sim- 
 ple experiments, but the one we would most seriously recom- 
 mend to all is our old favorite, "clean seed upon clean soil."

The Cultivation of Colza, or Rape Seed. 

BY F. N. NAUTTS. 

As a good thing, like the Lord's Prayer, cannot be repeat- 
 ed too often, I again venture to urge on the planting interest 
 of this country, and this section of the United Stales in par- 
 ticular, the expediency of turning their serious attention to 
 the raising of such crops as will prove not only more profit- 
 able to them individually than the common crops raised now 
 but likewise of vast importance in a national point of 
 view. I moan the raising of such crops that are used in the 
 arts and manufactures, and are imported to the amount of 
 several millions per annum, for the north Atlantic States 
 only, and which can be as easily raised here. This will in 
 time become more incumbent and imperative on farmers and 
 planters of the Eastern and South Eastern States to learn 
 and try to raise, as every successive year shows conclusively 
 that these States cannot compete to raise as successfully tho 
 cereals or grains with the North Western, Western, and South 
 Western States. I will then repeat, not my prayer, but my 
 admonitions which I begun in 1853-4 pass in review which 
 crops can be cultivated with most success and profit, although 
 a well wisher to his country will not do amiss to offer up his 
 prayers at the same time that my suggestions may be adopt- 
 ed. I will bpgin, then, by the oleaginous or oil bearing 
 plants, at the head of which stands preeminent the 
 BRASSICA OLERAC.EA CAMPESTRIS. 

Rape Seed is not only an object of the greatest importance 
 and value, wherever it is raised, for the sake of the seed, 
 but is likewise extremely valuable as green food for cattle 
 and sheep, in the fall or spring, or cured for hay for winter. 

The Colza or Rape is a plant which requires by preference 
 a strong soil, although it will come well on good sand or 
 gravelly loams, with careful cultivation. 

In Belgium, and the northern parts of France, where it is 
 raised in great abundance, it enters into the regular rotation 
 on all good heavy loams, and is thought to be one of the best 
 preparations for wheat, owing to the tillage of the soil, tho 
 manure applied for it, and the care taken to keep it clear of 
 weeds; it also comes best after wheat, provided this grain 
 crop has been properly manured, in which case rape seed 
 can be sown without manuring again, and will yield a good 
 crop. 

The ground should be ploughed in tho fall or spring, and 
 again a short time before sowing, and well manured. Then 
 the Seed should be sown very thin in drills, and harrowed in 
 in June or July. As the plants come up, they should be 
 weeded and thined out, a foot apart. A superior mode is to 
 sow tho seed broadcast, on a good rich seed bed, prepared on 
 purpose. When the stubble of any grain crop has been 
 cleared oft" by the harrow, the land well manured and 
 ploughed to a good depth, the plants are brought out, and 
 set out as cabbage plants are. This can be done six or eight 
 weeks after sowing, or the latter end of September, or in 
 October, either by the dibble or by hand, setting them out iu 
 every respect like the plants of cabbage, in rows two to two 
 and a half feet wide, and one foot in the row; or to save much 
 time, labor and trouble, they can be put in furrows one foot 
 apart, after the plough, taking care to put them up right in 
 the furrow, and to cover them by the return of the plough, 
 leaving the leaves above ground and after the piece is fin- 
 ished, going over it to dress all plants that might be covered 
 too deep, which can be done by a man walking along the fur- 
 rows and pressing his foot against the plant, or with the hoe. 
 Tho intervals between the rows should get a hoeing, or the 
 cultivator run in, or a small plow sent through, to give them 
 an earthing up, killing th« weeds at the same time, which 
 should be done as late in the fall as the weather will permit,
