Removal. 

After mature consideration, we have determined to re- 
 move our publication office to the city of Philadelphia ; 
 and in furtherance of this purpose, we have rented the 
 large room at No. 33£ North Seventh street. The editor 
 will reside, as heretofore, at West Chester, but to avoid 
 confusion, all letters and communications may hereafter 
 be addressed as above, instead of to West Chester as 
 formerly. 

To those who may desire to learn the reason of this 
 change we will say, that the inconvenience in having our 
 forms stereotyped, the difficulties recently experienced in 
 having our press work properly executed, and the almost 
 impossibility of having our folding, stiching and covering- 
 done in season, are in themselves sufficient to warrant it. 
 We may add, that at least nineteen-twentieths of all the 
 letters we receive come by way of Philadelphia, and a 
 like proportion of those we mail, as well as a like pro- 
 portion of the Farm Journals, pass through that city on 
 their way to their destinations. The great mass of our 
 letters are a day longer in reaching us, and our replies 
 and Journals are a day longer in reaching those for whom 
 they are intended, than if our business office was in the 
 city. Here we are in the centre of a district of unsur- 
 passed fertility and productiveness, there we will be in 
 the centre of trade and travel from Pennsylvania, New 
 Jersey and Delaware; — here we occasionally meet our 
 friends from different parts of this county, there we may 
 more frequently meet them from all parts of this and ad- 
 joining States; — a location here is most congenial to our 
 tastes, a situation there best calculated to promote our 
 interests. 

It is not, we confess, without feelings of deep regret 
 that we are constrained to leave a pleasant residence in 
 the beautiful borough of West Chester, and remove from 
 among a large circle of valued friends; but our interests 
 too clearly indicate our course, to prevent personal com- 
 forts, associations, and predilections to govern it. 

Ere this number reaches our patrons we hope to be 
 fairly installed at No. 33 J North Seventh street, where 
 we shall be happy to meet them one and all.

The Best Washing Machine. 
 A subscriber inquires of us "which is the best wash- 
 ing machine," but as we are unacquainted with the re- 
 spective merits of the different articles, we trust that 
 some of our readers who are will give us their opinion 
 on this matter.

The Field Pea as a Renovator of the Soil.— No. 2. 

BY J. S. HOUGHTON, M. D. 

In a recent number of the Farm Journal, I presented 
 a general view of the merits of the Field Pea, or Cow 
 Pea, which is much employed in the South as a means 
 of improving exhausted soils, particularly those of a 
 sandy character. Since writing that article, I have 
 spent some weeks in Virginia, (where I now write tho 
 present one,) and have had some further opportunity of 
 studying the usefulness of the crop, the methods of cul- 
 tivating, &c. With this increased knowledge on the 
 subject, I am more than ever impressed with its value in 
 respect to its product in grain, as green or dry fodder, 
 or as a manuring crop to be turned under like clover, 
 before corn or wheat. The black-eyed white Field Pea, 
 which is somewhat grown in New Jersey, is much used 
 in Virginia and the more Southern States upon the ta- 
 ble, stewed with pork, or as pea soup, in the winter, and 
 is much relished by many persons. The brown pea is 
 used in this way in Georgia upon the tables of the best 
 hotels ; but to my taste, the flavor of it is not very 
 agreeable. These peas are sold in the markets at the 
 South at about $1 25 to $1 50 per bushel. The ave- 
 rage yield of seed per acre, with the careless cultivation 
 of negro labor, is about sixteen to twenty bushels. The 
 vines are also valuable as win ter fodder for all kinds of , 
 stock. 

I find the Field Pea planted in a great variety of ways, 
 viz : as a separate crop, in drills or broadcast ; between 
 the hills with corn, at the same time corn is planted ; in 
 drills between the rows of corn ; broadcast between th« 
 rows of corn, at the last working of the corn; and after 
 grain, broadcast, to be ploughed under in the fall. 

All the methods of planting this pea have their pecu- 
 liar advantages according to the various circumstances 
 under which they are resorted to. To obtain the best 
 crop of seed and vines, no method can surpass the 
 planting in drills as a separate crop, and cultivating as we 
 do the table pea at the North. The drills are here made 
 from four to five feet apart, and the peas aro dropped 
 from two to three feet distant in the rows, like corn, 
 from ten to fifteen peas in a hill. The vines will spread 
 so as to cover the entire surface of the ground with a 
 heavy mass of vegetable matter, two or three feet deep, 
 of a rich dark green color, throughout the longest and 
 dryest season. This pea, like the clover, (to which class 
 of plants it belongs,) is very deeply rooted, and thus by 
 means of its numerous leaves and 3ong roots, abstracts
