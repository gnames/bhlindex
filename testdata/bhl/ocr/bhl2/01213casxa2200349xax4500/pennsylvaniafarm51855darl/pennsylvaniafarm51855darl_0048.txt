from the earth and the ah- a vast amount of nutriment, 
 (especially carbonic acid, -water and ammonia,) the three 
 great elements of vegetable growth, and thus rather 
 ;idds to the riches of the farm than impoverishes it. 

My own opinion is, formed after a very slight and im- 
 perfect trial of the pea last season, that it would be bet- 
 ter to plant the pea in drills as they do the English gar- 
 den pea on the truck farms in New Jersey, sowing them 
 along the drill, instead of planting ten or fifteen in a 
 hill. Experiment, however, will decide the question. 
 The seed may be gathered by hand, and then the vines 
 may be cut up with a hoe or scythe, and cured for fod- 
 ■ler ; or the vines may be mowed and cured, and the 
 peas may be threshed out like any other grain. 

As a separate crop for seed, the sowing of these peas 
 broadcast is not generally thought to bring so good a 
 crop, or to be so easy to gather. It is also more apt to 
 leave the land foul. It has only one advantage over the 
 culture in drills, namely : it requires less labor in culti- 
 vation. 

The sowing of this pea between the hills of corn, at 
 the same time the corn is planted, strikes me as a very 
 j mkI plan, although I have not much information as to 
 the value of the crop thus obtained. The writers in the 
 Southern agricultural papers say it is rather an uncer- 
 tain crop when thus planted, as the corn is apt to shade 
 j t too much. Corn is here (in Virginia) planted very much 
 in drills, a single stalk in a hill, and not three stalks as 
 you have more generally in Pennsylvania. This, I sup- 
 pose, is because the land is light, and will not mature 
 three stalks in the hill. On fair land, or that which has 
 been properly manured, the farmers tell me they get a 
 rood crop of peas, when planted with corn as above de- 
 scribed. 

Planting in drills between the rows of corn, or sowing 
 1 rcadcast between the rows of corn at the last working, 
 1 have not seen practically in any field that I have visit- 
 cd. As far North as Pennsylvania or New Jersey it 
 would not answer, if a seed crop was desired, as the 
 peed would scarcely ripen well if sowed so late as the 
 last working of corn. 

As a broadcast crop after grain, in the South, to be 
 turned under in the fall, or as a broadcast crop in Penn- 
 sylvania and New Jersey, to be turned under as manure, 
 or fed to stock in the field, it is one of great value. The 
 ' m is too short with you, I think, to get a good crop 
 of vines after wheat or oats, the same season. But in 
 Virginia and farther South, this is done with great ad- 
 vantage. I saw a field near Richmond, a few days ago, 
 on which wheat had been raised with a large increase of 
 grain every year for three years in succession, and now 
 in wheat again for the fourth year, with a fine show of 
 young blades ; and this was in some degree attributable 
 io the fact that as soon as the wheat was removed, peas 
 ■■.vere sown broadcast and produced, the same season, a 
 rich and heavy crop of vines partly seeded, which were 
 then turned under when preparing the ground for the 
 next sowing of wheat. To be sure the owner of the field 
 is a wealthy man, and manures heavily with ashes and 
 house offal from the city, and probably also with guano, 
 bone dust, or other concentrated manures ; but beyond 
 aU question, much of the material which goes to form 
 the wheat crop is really created on the field by the pea, 

and would have to be furnished in the form of loam, or 
 peat, or some other carbonaceous matter, if not so cre- 
 ated by the pea. The pea vine and the pea are also rich 
 in nitrogen, or the element of ammonia. 

Now, in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, you may not 
 be able to grow the pea vines successfully the same sea- 
 son after wheat ; but it struck me that, if the land way 
 in fair heart, a farmer might, by judicious manuring, 
 grow wheat every other year on the same field alternate- 
 ly with peas, broadcast, to be turned under as a green 
 crop; or if the land was stiff, the peas might be allowed 
 to ripen enough for seed, and then be turned under to 
 open and loosen the soil. I suppose nearly all plain, 
 practical farmers would prefer a more general rotation 
 of crops to such a course as this ; but while wheat is so 
 valuable, it may be worth while to consider if we can 
 supply the constituents of that crop economically, and 
 keep the land good, while we still grow it year after 
 year, or every other year, upon the same field. My own 
 opinion is, that gradually increasing crops might be ob- 
 tained, in alternation with peas turned under, by a suf- 
 ficient manuring with stable manure, or better still with 
 guano, bone dust, and ashes or potash, properly applied. 
 The proper mixture and proper method of applying 
 these materials, I cannot discuss in this article. As a 
 preparation for corn, oats, or other grain, the field pea 
 is equally as valuable a fertilizer as for wheat. 

In Virginia and the South genei'ally, hogs are largely 
 fed upon the field pea, by being turned directly into the 
 field. Cows and sheep are also fed in the same way. It 
 is not the practice in the South to gather much hay or 
 fodder of any kind for stock. They are fed and fatted 
 in the open field, and must take care of themselves to a 
 very great extent. It has been said that the pea, grown 
 upon rich black soil, and in wet weather, has killed hogp 
 and other stock. But this effect is now pretty generally 
 attributed by the most intelligent farmers to two causes : 
 first, feeding stock too freely on dry peas, when hungry, 
 the peas afterwards swelling in the stomach, and caus- 
 ing colic and death ; and secondly, permitting stock to 
 eat rotten peas and decaying vines in wet weather. 
 Eating sound peas, in moderation, does no injury to any 
 kind of stock, but they are found to be exceedingly nu- 
 tritious and even fattening. 

The Field Pea, as I have stated in a previous article, 
 delights in sandy soil, and will grow where clover will 
 not, affording a vast amount of foliage and shading the 
 land completely, on even the poorest soil, without any 
 other manure than a little charcoal or well rotted muck 
 or peat. Lime, as it is well known, is essential to the 
 growth of the pea, as well as the clover, and plaster of 
 Paris is a very appropriate dressing where a crop of 
 peas is desired. Guano would, of course, increase the 
 luxuriance of the vines, but without plaster, especially 
 on rich ground, might fail to make peas. 

I trust that my suggestions on this subject may lead 
 some farmers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to give 
 this pea a trial, and that they will favor us with the re- 
 sults.
