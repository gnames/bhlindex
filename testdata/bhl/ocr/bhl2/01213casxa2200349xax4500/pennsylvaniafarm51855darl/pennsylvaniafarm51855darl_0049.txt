probably impair the color of the silk. Brown or blue 
 paper is better ; the yellowish, smooth, Indian paper is 
 best of all. Silk intended for dress should not be kept 
 long in the house before it is made up, as lying in the 
 folds will have a tendency to impair its durability by 
 causing it to cut or split, particularly if the silk has 
 been thickened by gum. 

Thread lace veils are very easily cut ; satin and velvet 
 being soft are not easily cut, but dresses of velvet should 
 not be laid by with any weight above them. If the 
 knap of thin velvet is laid down, it is not possible to 
 raise it up again. Hard silk should never be wrinkled, 
 because the thread is easily broken in the crease, and it 
 never can be rectified. The way to take the wrinkles 
 out of silk scarfs or handkerchiefs is to moisten the sur- 
 face evenly with a sponge and some weak glue, and then 
 pin the silk with some toilet pins around the shelves on 
 a mattrass or feather bed, taking pains to draw out the 
 silk as tight as possible. When dry the wrinkles will 
 have disappeared. The reason of this is obvious to ev- 
 ery person. It is a nice job to dress light colored silk, 
 and few should try it, Some silk articles should be 
 moistened with weak glue or gum-water, and the wrin- 
 kles ironed out by a hot flat-iron on the wrong side. —

Soil Analysis. 

Letter from Prof. Haldcman to C. P. Holcomb, Esq., 

Neivcastle, Del. 

Dear Sir: — In a letter to the Editor of the Delaware 
 Gazette, Dr. D. Stewart expresses the opinion that the 
 Agricultural Department of Delaware College should 
 compete for the $100 premium of the Maryland Agri- 
 cultural Society, for the best formula for soil analysis, 
 and he enlarges upon the importance of such a for- 
 mula. 

It appears that in 1850 he wished Professor Henry to 
 have a premium offered by the Smithsonian Institution 
 for the best formula. Professor Henry replied truly, 
 that "it would be impossible to get any three chemists 
 to unite in preferring any formula for soil analysis." 
 Nor would such a formula be adhered to. Analysis in- 
 volves so many elements, that no general rule, or rather 
 system of rules, can be given. The operations can be 
 greatly varied, and still a reliable result obtained. 
 Much depends upon the apparatus, and the purity and 
 number of the chemicals used. 

If a chemist cannot depend upon one of his re-agents 
 he can often take another, and if he has not some ex- 
 pensive piece of apparatus, he can vary his mode of 
 procedure, and, in fact, he ought to do so to verify his 
 results. He may use a "dry mode," or a "wet mode," 
 or follow Woehler on one point and Rose on another. 

One mode of determination may be used if the chem- 
 ist collects his own specimens, and another if they are 
 sent to him ; because, in the former case, geology will 
 inform him what to expect. One person may analyse 
 the entire mass, another reject the granular matter 
 which could not for many years form a fertilizing por- 
 tion of the soil ; and one will perform successive steps 
 with fresh portions of his material, whilst another will 
 make extensive use of his residuum. One mode may be 
 pursued if twenty analyses are progressing together, and 

another if there is but one on hand ; whilst an economi- 
 cal chemist will often use a mode because it does not in- 
 volve the use of expensive chemicals, as chloride of pla- 
 tinum. 

The argument for a formula, drawn from the use of a 
 uniform Pharmacopoea, has no bearing here. The phy- 
 sician' must know the composition and strength of the 
 tinctures, extracts and compounds, furnished by the 
 apothecary, and hence the necessity of uniformity. 
 But should it become necessary to analyse a compound 
 like the Cherry Pectoral of the forger Ayer, (I say for- 
 ger because he forged the name of Prof. Silliman to help 
 his nostrum,) each chemist will take his own mode in 
 detecting the prussic acid in it. If the analytical chem- 
 ist is to submit to formulas without using his own judg- 
 ment, he becomes a mere apothecary, and his profession 
 sinks to a trade. 

Whilst I have no doubt of the value of the mode;? 
 adopted by Dr. Stewart, (and their employment in Dr. 
 Higgins' labratory is good evidence in their favor,) 1 
 think I have said enough to justify the course of Prof. 
 Henry. 

Boussingault has found thatcarbonic acid is quite abun- 
 dant in the soil, and as it has au important part to per- 
 form, directly and indirectly, in vegetation, besides the 
 composition, the mechanical structure, consistency, and 
 depth of the soil and subsoil must be known, (as well as 
 the amount of carbonic acid and ammonia,) which can- 
 not be well ascertained in specimens not carefully col- 
 lected and preserved. It is probable that a soil will be 
 richest in ammonia in the month of March. A separate 
 analysis of the subsoil is not usually made as it should 
 be, when it exists in a distinct state within the reach of 
 cultivation. 

Have we not room to believe that much of the dissa- 
 tisfaction with agricultural practice founded upon soil 
 analysis has arisen from neglecting the agency of car- 
 bonic acid, which is not mentioned in many analyses, al- 
 though, from its great power as a solvent, it must exer- 
 cise much influence upon the other ingredients present.

Grapes in Consumption. 

The use of grapes as an article of food is much recom- 
 mended in cases of consumption. They contain a largr* 
 quantity of grape sugar, the kind which most nearly re 
 sembles milk sugar in its character and composition, 
 which also is very useful for consumptives, it having a 
 great attraction for oxygen, and, therefore, readily af- 
 fording materials for respiration.

Domestic Guano. 

If ten millions of dollars are paid out of the United 
 States annually for imported guano, is it not time for 
 farmers to commence the manufacture of domestic gu- 
 ano, if, as is said, every family of four persons may 
 make a ton, by saving -what is now thrown away ? 

During the winter, the earlier the better, examine 
 your wagons, carts, tools and implements, repair all that 
 require it, give them a coat of cheap paint, and put all 
 not required for use away under cover.
