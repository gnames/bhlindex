they intend for seed, so as to be able to select only the 
 pure varieties from it, and otherwise dispose of the re- 
 mainder. There is a constant tendency in vegetables to 
 deteriorate, or run back to their original wild state. 
 The intelligent and experienced seed grower readily de- 
 tects this tendency at a glance in the peculiar curl of 
 the leaf, habit of growth, and some, to him, striking pe- 
 culiarity, entirely unobserved by others. This is cause 
 of constant watchfulness and anxiety. 

Next to the drug business, where mistakes from care- 
 lessness or ignorance endanger life, I think the seed 
 business requires the greatest integrity, carefulness and 
 minute attention. The cultivator, whether farmer or 
 gardener, must rely upon the assurances of the seeds- 
 man when he plants his crop, and the latter is responsi- 
 ble to the community to leave no stone unturned, either 
 by growing them himself, or having them grown under 
 his supervision by others, to ensure correctness and re- 
 liability. Yours, A VICTIM TO BAD SEEDS.

Mercer County Agricultural Society 

Mr. Editor: — In the November number of the Farm 
 Journal, you desired to have the proceedings of the 
 Mercer County Agricultural Fair. Enclosed I send you 
 a list of the premiums awarded at the third annual exhi- 
 bition of the society held at Mercer on the nineteenth 
 and twentieth days of September. 

The first day was appropriated to receiving, entering, 
 and arranging articles for exhibition. Second, was devo- 
 ted to the exhibition of articles and animals, which were 
 entered on the secretary's books the first day, and the 
 awarding of premiums, &c. 

Owing to the severe drouth which visited our county 
 during the greater part of the summer, many persons 
 predicted our fair would be a failure; but when the time 
 arrived all fears of this kind were cast from our minds. 
 At an early hour horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs, came 
 in droves, and by ten o'clock A. M. our grounds were 
 one moving mass of animals and human beings. The 
 day being beautiful the number of people- in attendance 
 was greater than at any previous exhibition. The show 
 of stock was superior in both quantity and quality to 
 any previous fair. 

Over one hundred horses and colts were on exhibition 
 many of them fine and beautiful. A number of fine cat- 
 tle were exhibited mostly of the Durham breed, as 
 they are most generally prefered by our stock growers, 
 to any other breeds. The sheep and hog depart- 
 ment was well represented. In the mechanical depart- 
 ment there was a slight falling off from last year, and as 
 a matter of course (owing to the drouth) the display of 
 vegetables was not so good. From the number of spec- 
 tators who gathered around the horse ring, and the loud 
 peals of laughter and shouts of joy told that this part of 
 the exhibition attracted a due share of attention. 

You will learn from our list of premiums, that we 
 award no premiums for lady riding &c. It is the object 
 of our society to encourage and promote the interest of 
 the farmers and mechanics, also domestic economy and 
 industry &c,. and not like some- of our sister counties 
 make a grand equesterian show and pay ten times more 

for the best lady rider than they do for the best horse or 
 bull or thirty times the amount paid for the best quilt, 
 or any specimen of domestic manufacture. The interest 
 manifested by our farmers iu stock shows that they are 
 determined to keep pace with their brethern elswhere in 
 growing the largest, best and most of it, and from the 
 amount of blooded stock purchased and brought into our 
 county within a few months, and the adaption of our soil 
 to stock growing, we expect soon to be able to compete 
 with older counties that have been engaged iu this busi- 
 ness for years. 

The society met on the thirteenth of October and elec- 
 ted the following officers for the ensuing year. President 
 William Waugh, Recording Secretary J. II. Robison, Cor- 
 responding Secretary Seth Hoagland, Treasurer A. J. 
 Greer, and one Vice President in each township; a com- 
 mittee of five persons was also appointed to erect on the 
 fair grounds a floral and Mechanics Hall. 

Our grounds contain about five acres enclosed with a 
 tight board fence beautifully shaded by the native oaks, 
 and situated on a beautiful eminence, within one mile 
 and in full view of the borough of Mercer, the society 
 has at great expense brought water from a neighboring 
 spring by means of pipes into the fair ground which will 
 make the supply of this very necessary article inexhaus- 
 tible, and with the improvements of the above mentions d 
 buildings we hope to make it the resort of all the enter- 
 prising inhabitants of our county at least once every 
 year, to compare their products and aave an interchange 
 of sentiments on the great questi >u of successfully till- 
 ing the soil &c. 

In all premiums of two dollars and upwards our socie- 
 ty has awarded the Pennsylvania Farm Journal, in lieu 
 of one dollar for one year. Yours respectfully,

 Please admit a few questions into your columns, or 
 answer them editorially, and oblige many. Why docs 
 wheat grow and yield better on clover sod plowed three 
 months before sowing than on that plowed but a few 
 days or weeks ? Why do committees award premiums 
 on machinery and implements that are good for nothing 
 and that they know nothing about ? Will sheep sustain 
 any injury from hen lice ? T. W.

 In the winter of 1852-3, we fed seven cows on good 
 English hay, cut and mixed with one quart of oil-meal 
 and two quarts of cob-meal, per day, for each cow. In 
 the winter of 1853-4, the same cows, coming in about 
 the same time, fed on hay cut upon the same ground as 
 that of the previous year, and with the addition of four 
 bushels of ruta bagas per day, but not a spoonful of 
 grain of any kind, gave just double the gallons of milk 
 that they did when fed on grain ! The circumstances 
 under which the cows existed, both winters, were alike, 
 with the exception of temperature — the weather being 
 much the coldest when they gave the most milk. The 
 barn, however, in which they were kept is a very warm 
 one, so that in the coldest weather they were all com- 
 fortable.— N. E. Farmer.
