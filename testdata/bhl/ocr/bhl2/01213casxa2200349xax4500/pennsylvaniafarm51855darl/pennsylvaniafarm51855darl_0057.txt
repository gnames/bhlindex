admiring gaze of the multitude. Quite a large quantity 
 of house plants were exhibited, which did great credit 
 to the taste of the owners. 

The display of horsemanship was by far the most 
 exciting and interesting part of the Fair. The ladies' 
 horsemanship was the grand feature of the day, and was 
 witnessed by 7000 or 8000 people. The contest was 
 long and doubtful, but was finally decided in favor of 
 Miss Lawrence amid the cheers of the immense crowd." 

Hop Culture. 
 [concluded from page 18.] 

"Fifty pounds of hops, when dried, is the largest 
 quantity that should be dried at one time, on a kiln of 
 this size ; and unless absolutely necessary to put on that 
 quantity, a less would dry better. The green hops 
 should be spread as evenly and as light as possible over 
 the kiln. The -fire at first should be moderate, but it 
 may be increased as the hops dry and the steam is eva- 
 porated. 

" Hops should not remain long in the bin or bag after 
 they are picked, as they will very soon heat and become 
 insipid. The hops should not be stirred on the kiln un- 
 til they are completely and fully dried. Then they 
 should be removed from the kiln into a dry room, and 
 laid in a heap, and there remain, unmoved and unsth'r- 
 ed, until bagged, which is done with a screw, having a 
 box made of plank, the size the box is wished, into 
 which the cloth is laid, and the hops screwed into the 
 box, which is so constructed that the sides may be re- 
 moved, and the bag sewed together while in the press. 

"The hops, after laying a few days, will gather a 
 partial moisture, called a sweat. The sweat will proba- 
 bly begin to subside in about eight days, at which time, 
 and before the sweat is off, they ought to be bagged in 
 clear dry weather. As the exact time when the hops 
 will begin to sweat, and when the sweat will begin to 
 subside or dry off, [the proper time to bag them,] will 
 vary with the state of the atmosphere, it will be neces- 
 sary to examine the hops from day to day, which is 
 easily done by taking some of them from the centre of 
 the heap with your hand. If on examination you find 
 the hops to be very damp, and their color altering, 
 which will be the case if they were not completely dried 
 on the kiln, and not otherwise, you must overhaul them 
 and dry them in the air. 

"The most convenient size for a bag of hops, to han- 
 dle and transport, is about five feet in length, and to 
 contain about two hundred and fifty pounds. The best 
 bagging is coarse, strong tow cloth, of our domestic 
 manufacturing ; next to that, Russian hemp bagging. 
 The East India sugar and gunny bags, so called, ought 
 never to be used. The sugar bags are of an unreasona- 
 ble weight, and both they and the gunny bags are of no 
 value to the brewer ; whereas the other bags are worth 
 prime cost. 

"It is now common for those who have entered con- 
 siderably into the cultivation of hops, to build houses 
 over their kilns, which, in wet weather, are very conve- 
 nient; otherwise, a kiln in the open air would be prefer- 
 able. It is necessary to have these buildings well venti- 
 lated with doors and windows ; and to have them kept 
 open night and day, except in wet weather, and then 

shut those only which are necessary to keep out the rain. 
 If a ventilator was put in the roof of the building, di- 
 rectly over the centre of the kiln, about six feet square, 
 built like those in breweries and distilleries, they would 
 be found very advantageous. I have seen many lots of 
 hops much injured both in color and flavor by being 
 dried in close buildings. 

"Where the houses over the kilns are built large, for 
 the purpose of storing the hops as they are dried, which 
 is a great saving of labor, a close partition should be 
 made between the kilns and the room in which the hops 
 are stored, to prevent the damp steam from the kilns 
 coming to them, as it will color them, and injure their 
 flavor-and quality very much. 

"I expect that many of our farmers will objeet to the 
 mode of manuring hops which I have recommended, 
 their common practice being to put the manure in the 
 hills when they plant the hops, and afterwards to apply 
 the manure on the hills at the first and second hoeings. 
 I find the hop -roots are very liable to be injured by the 
 worms, and to decay. My opinion is, that the manure 
 in the hill has a tendency to produce the worms, and its 
 fermentation at their roots to cause their decay; and 
 that the crop is not more, if as abundant, as when ma- 
 nured in the manner I have recommended ; and, farther, 
 that a hop-yard manured in this manner will continue in 
 a healthy state for many years. 

"I also expect the quantity of manure I have recom- 
 mended will be objected to by many, it being the com- 
 monly received opinion, that hops should have little or 
 no manure. I find it a general complaint amongst the 
 farmers where hops have been cultivated many years, 
 that the quantity raised per acre does not exceed the 
 one-half raised by their ancestors on the same land; in- 
 ferring that the 'hops are running out,' as it is termed, 
 and cannot now be cultivated to advantage. Hops, in 
 common with all sorts of grain and vegetables, flourish 
 best and produce the finest crops when cultivate:! on new 
 lands, which require little or no manure ; and such were 
 the lands which their ancestors cultivated. The same 
 complaint, I presume, would be made against all sorts of 
 grain and vegetables, if raised with little or no manure, 
 on lands that have long been cultivated." 

Practical Hints about Poultry. 
 Whether the large sized varieties of fowls which "are 
 all the rage" now amongst fancy breeders and dealers, 
 are really preferable to the old-fashioned barn-yard 
 fowls, is a subject of which there are two opinions 
 among those who have tried both. To say nothing of 
 the enormous prices which they occasionally command, 
 they weigh heavily in the market scales, or fill a large 
 platter on the dinner table. But on the other hand, 
 they are great gormandizers themselves, and are gen- 
 erally considered difficult to raise. Roosters should be 
 changed as often as once in two years, if not annually; 
 and pains should be taken, in replacing them, to pro- 
 cure strong, healthy and perfect birds; the hen will lay 
 better, and hatch more chickens. Only a small number 
 of hens should be kept in one house, or together. We 
 have known repeated instances in which keepers of 
 poultry have become disgusted at their failure to lay, 
 and have determined to kill them off. They have com-
