THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[February 

menced reducing the number, which was perhaps forty 
 or fifty, and when they got down to half a dozen, were 
 surprised to find every one of the hens laying, and the 
 supplies of eggs for the family better than the whole 
 number furnished. As to profit, we doubt whether, if 
 all their food be bought, the eggs and chickens produced 
 by any breed, and sold at the regular market prices, for 
 the table, will pay the expense of keeping, but it by no 
 means follows from this, that hens are not a source of 
 profit on a farm. They eat much of what would other- 
 wise be entirely lost and wasted ; and a small patch of 
 buckwheat, sown at a trifling cost, and left on the 
 ground where they can stroll over it and feed at their 
 pleasure, will keep them as fat as butter. The main 
 point is, the great value of the manure of poultry. The 
 hen-roost is the place where most farmers should go for 
 their guano. If obtained there, it will invariably prove 
 of good quality. There need be no fear for those who 
 get their guano from this source, that it will turn out to 
 be spurious or inferior. 

We doubt whether even intelligent farmers would es- 
 timate at more than one-hundredth part of its amount 
 the quantity of excellent manure, which can be made in 
 this way in the course of a year. The hen-roost, duck- 
 roost and turkey-roost should be supplied with several 
 loads of peat, swamp muck, or both, spread evenly over 
 the surface of the floor, and on this there should be 
 scattered a thin layer of sand or gravel. On rainy 
 days, when the work can be done as well as not — and as 
 often as practicable — this should be all shoveled over, 
 and the manures thus mixed with the other ingredients. 
 The compost soon becomes strong, when it can be re- 
 moved, and fresh supply of suitable material thrown in. 
 The house is kept sweet, clean and healthy for the fowls; 
 and if any farmer will adopt this plan, and practice it 
 faithfully for five years, and keep an accurate account 
 of the crops raised directly from the compost made with 
 the poultry manure, and from the manure made by feed- 
 ing those crops out in their turn, he will be amazed at 
 the amount of each which he will have realized, and at 
 the permanent improvement of his farm. — Londonderry

Orchards, Apples, and the Market. 

"David, I am going to quit the nursery business. In 
 twenty-one years fruit will be a drug in New York city. 
 Why, every body is setting out orchards. Just look 
 around this neighborhood ! There is deacon Jones has 
 just set out 500 trees ; Tom Smith 400, and his brother 
 Jim will have 1000 next spring, and so on at that rate 
 all over the country — grafted fruit, too, none of it for 
 cider. Now what do you suppose is to become of all 
 these apples ? I tell you what it is, David, we must 
 wind up the nursery business or we shall break flat. 
 Every body is going crazy about fruit. Every body will 
 grow it, but no body buy it, a few years hence." 

This prognostication was made more than twenty 
 years ago by a sensible man engaged in propagating 
 choice fruits for sale in Central New York, and no doubt 
 the speaker honestly believed the days of the nursery- 
 man were well nigh numbered. Brother David, howev- 
 er, was of a different opinion. He did not believe it 
 was so easy to overstock the market with such fruit as 

no other than American soil and climate can produce. 
 He did not believe 'ere twenty years' time would elapse 
 every body would have an orchard, the products of 
 which would be so unsaleable, and the business so un- 
 profitable, the owner could have no desire to plant more 
 or better, or newer varieties of trees ; consequently he 
 urged that the business should be perseveringly contin- 
 ued until the dawning of the evil day was more visible 
 in the horizon. 

What has been the result ? A sale of 40,000 apple 
 trees and 7,000 of other fruits during the planting sea- 
 son of last year, and the prospect for the next equally 
 good. The very men who had planted 500, have in- 
 creased 1000, and some of them have doubled that ten- 
 fold ; and yet the market is now better than it ever was 
 before for all the choice varieties of the product of or- 
 chard, vineyard, or garden. The market is not yet glut- 
 ted, nor can it be while millions of mouths continually 
 water for the luscious fruits which contrast so advan- 
 tageously with the sour crabs, "five to a pint/' which 
 filled the market twenty years ago. The market cannot 
 be glutted with such fruit as the Newtown pippins, Rox-' 
 bury russets, Rhode Island greenings, Baldwins, Belle- 
 fleur, Swaar, Domine, and a great variety of other ex- 
 cellent winter keeping apples ; while the luxury-loving 
 mouths of old England are within two weeks (we have 
 done counting distance by miles,) of the fruit bearing 
 hills of New England. Nay, not only New England and 
 New York, but the ever bearing trees of the rich plains 
 of that once far away western wild, known in our boy- 
 hood as New Connecticut. But still the market is not 
 glutted, nor will it be, though all Ohio, Michigan, Indi- 
 ana, Illinois, and Wisconsin, shall pour in their golden 
 treasures of golden pippins from their unbounded plains 
 of the richest fruit bearing land the world ever saw, 
 while that same world full of people possess the taste 
 they now do for choice, delicious fruits. 

Our advice, therefore, is, as it has always been, to ev- 
 ery man who owns an acre of land — plant trees. Don't 
 be afraid of overstocking the market with any kind of 
 fruit, except such as your fathers used to grow, and 
 some of you still perpetuate ; because the refined and 
 improved tastes of the world demand, and will have, if 
 it is procurable, the best that can be grown. — Osiccgo

Wintering Young Cattle. 
 If you wish to raise well sized, full developed animals, 
 you must give the young creatures plenty of food. 
 When we say plenty, we do not mean that you should 
 keep them fat like show beeves, for that would be an 
 unhealthy condition ; but we mean that you should keep 
 them in good growing condition — that you should so 
 feed them as that they shall have wherewithal to build 
 up their frames. 

Cure for Ringbone. 
 I noticed in the Cultivator for May 15th, an inquiiy 
 for the cure of a ringbone in a colt, and answer, take 
 high wines of cider brandy, add saltpetre as much as 
 will dissolve, and wash the ringbone two or three times 
 a day. One of my neighbors cured one of three or four 
 years' standing, by the application of this a few times. —
