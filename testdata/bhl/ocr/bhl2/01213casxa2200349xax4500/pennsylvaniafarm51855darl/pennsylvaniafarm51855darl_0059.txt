Work for the Month. 

Farm. — February is usually the last month of leisure 
 previous to commencing active operations on the farm; 
 but it frequently happens that there are several weeks 
 of open weather, which enables those who have not had 
 their corn ground plowed to do it now. It is necessary, 
 however, to guard against plowing when the ground is 
 too wet. Teams that have stood idle for some time 
 should be gradually inured to work. We have fre- 
 quently known horses, kept stabled during the winter, 
 and when spring opened put to constant work, lose 
 much of their flesh, and not pick up again before harvest. 
 A little foresight now may prevent the necessity of 
 hurry and over exertion a few months hence, — such as 
 having a full supply of wood for the entire season cut 
 up, fences repaired, implements put in proper order, 
 stones picked from mowing lands when necessary, drains 
 opened, &c, &c. In a word any thing that can be done 
 to advantage; but which necessarily need not be done for 
 two or three months, however, should not be put off. 
 This is a period of comparative leisure; that of compar- 
 tive labor. 

Fruit Orchard. — Take off cuttings of gooseberries 
 nnd currants, and bury them two thirds of their length 
 iu the earth, until wanted for planting out; also quince 
 cuttings, grafts of apple, pear, plum, cherries, and pea- 
 ches, may now be taken and preserved in damp saw-dust, 
 or earth till wanted. The two last must be cut before 
 any swelling of the buds has taken place. Grafting the 
 cherry will not succeed unless performed very early. 
 Budded peach trees which have missed may be success- 
 i 'ally side grafted if the buds have not swollen. Mulch 
 during this month of comparative leisure, all young fruit 
 Trees. Pruning may now be attended to. Head down 
 all apple and other trees of worthless varieties which 
 are for grafting and forming new tops . Leave some of 
 the lower branches for removal another season. If the 
 limbs are too large for grafting, the young shoots which 
 will be thrown out, may be budded the following fall, or 
 reserved for grafting the following spring. Two seasons, 
 at least, should be occupied in changing the heads of 
 large trees. A pole pruning-saw, pole-chisel, and pole- 
 pruning-shears, are necessary to perform this operation 
 thoroughly. Cut out all inside shoots and branches, 
 which crowd the head, and are useless. Those limbs 
 which have free access to sun and air are the fruit-bear- 
 ing and productive ones. Branches should radiate from 
 the trunk, something after the fashion of an umbrella. 
 When large limbs are removed, coat the surface of the 
 wound with shellac dissolved in alcohol, to about the 
 consistency of paint. Go round every peach tree and 
 shorten in the last year's growth about one-third, with 
 the pole pruning-shears. This has been very fully proven 
 to result in larger and finer fruit, and may be applied to 
 other trees beside the peach. Apply the wash, before 
 recommended, to the trunk and large limbs. Grape 
 vines should be pruned without delay. Trim gooseber- 
 ries and currants, by cutting out old wood and branches 
 uear the ground, so as to give somewhat of the tree 
 shape. Cut off at the ground old raspberry wood of last 
 year's bearing, and shorten in the new growth one-third. 
 Leave only four or five stalks to each plant. Raspber- 
 ries must be well manured to be productive, and moved 

to a new place at least once in five years. If frost 
 should be out of the ground by the last of the month, 
 strawberry beds may be raked over, and short manure 
 dug in between the rows. A good coat of ashes should 
 be spread over the whole bed. 

Flower Garden. — See directions for previous month. 

Vegetable Garden. — Manures should now be com- 
 posted and prepared for frames. Turn over occasionally 
 to allow the hot steam to pass off. From the middle to 
 the last of this month, frames may be set up, and some 
 cabbage, lettuce, radish, tomatoes, egg-plant and pep- 
 per seed sown for early planting. The two last require 
 rather more heat than the others, and should have a 
 separate frame, and never allowed to become chilled. 
 Select a sheltered place for hot beds on the south side of 
 a building or a tight fence. After seed is sown constant 
 attention is required. Cover with straw mats in nights 
 and in cold weather, and give air occasionally on fine 
 days. Should it be necessary to let off steam, cover 
 with something to keep out the cold, and prevent a 
 check to the bed or plants Radish and beet seed, early 
 vaieties, may be sown on a rich warm border" in open 
 ground, for early use, as soon as the frost is out of the 
 ground. Cover with straw in severe weather. By the 
 latter part of the month, extra early peas may be plant- 
 ed in rows for early crop, and also pota toes. Rhubarb 
 may be forced by covering the plants with a barrel and 
 filling up with manure. Continue to give air on fine days 
 to plants of last year's sowing, in cold and forcing 
 frames. By the last of the month, if the weather is 
 open, fork in manure on asparagus beds, give a plentiful 
 dressing of salt. 

Fine Devons in Pennsylvania. 

We are gratified in being able to announce the arrival 
 our State of some superior thorough bred Devon 
 stock, recently purchased by George F. Curwen, Esq., 
 of Montgomery county, from the select herd of the 
 Messrs. Wainwright, Dutchess county, New York. They 
 consist of a very superior bull, bred by Mr. George 
 Turner, of Englarfd, and three cows, Cherry, Rose and 
 Ida. Cherry is nine years old, from an imported bull 
 and cow, and has milked twenty quarts per day. Her 
 calf last spring was sold for $175. Rose, five years old, 
 out of Cherry, by the celebrated prize bull Major, will 
 calve in next July. Ida, two years old, out of Rose, was 
 gotten by Mayboy, the bull imported by the Messrs. 
 Wainwright. 

We congratulate the farmers of our State upon the 
 introduction of this superior stock. There is very little 
 of pure Devon stock in Pennsylvania, and it is a breed of 
 great value in several particulars. The high price of 
 stock cattle from the west, which our grazers are in the 
 habit of buying from the drovers, in order to give them 
 a coat of fat in Pennsylvania, and prepare them for the 
 butcher, makes it profitable and economical for us to 
 turn our attention to introducing improved breeds, and 
 raising our own. 

Let any one examine the history and expense of rear- 
 ing and feeding the magnificent oxen of George Brinton, 
 Esq., engraved in the last number of the Farm Journal, 
 and it will be seen that less feed will make more weight, 
 and of a better quality, and commanding from the
