Cultivation of Colza, or Rape Seed. 
 by f. n. nautts. 

[concluded from pace 32.] 
 If the land, as I suppose it is, is good, i. e. has been 
 properly manured for the previous crops, wheat, oats, &c, 
 there will be no occasion to manure it now, but if not, have 
 your manure laid in heaps, and throw a little at the root of 
 every plant, a handful will be sufficient , or, which is pre- 
 ferable, by throwing a handful of guano, previously well 
 mixed with four times its bulk of earth, or a good handful 
 of any good chemical fertilizer, at the foot of every plant, 
 the produce will be large, and the seed of good quality ; in 
 transplanting it will tell all the better in the crop, to roll the 
 roots of the plants in plaster of Paris, or ashes, or both 
 mixed. 

When the Rape is reaped, then sow turnips; thus three 
 profitable crops can be got out in two years from the same 
 piece of land, and the last two will improve your land. 

As observed above, Rape on land makes one of the best 
 preparations for wheat, but in this latter instance, I prescribe 
 a crop of turnips after it, it following probably wheat, or at 
 least a grain crop. 

The above is the management of Winter Rape; there is 
 another variety, called Spring or March Rape — this is culti- 
 vated and handled in every respect as the former, with this 
 difference, that it is sown early in the Spring, March or 
 April; hence its name, Spring or March Rape or Colza. 

It does not yield quite so large a produce as the Winter 
 Rapo, nor does the seed yield as much oil, but as it can be 
 sown in the Spring, and harvested at the latter end of Sum- 
 mer, or early Fall of the same year, it thus has great claims 
 to our attention and care. It requires the same quantity of 
 seed as the Winter Rape. 

The Rape plant is not only of great value in the economy 
 of the farm, as one of the best plants for fodder, as after 
 Quashing the seeds out, the plant is valuable, and yields a 
 ]*rge qnantity of nutritious fodder, relished by all kinds of 
 stock, but it is as invaluable as a plant yielding one of the 
 best and most prolific of all oleaginous seeds, that is the main 
 point to be considered and employed, and must attract our 
 most earnest and dilligent attention, besides the cultivation 
 >f it being, as observed above, a good preparation of the 
 land for cereal or grain crops. 

Tho Rape is likewise extremely valuable for the residue or 
 cake left after expressing oil from the seed, which is used 
 extensively for feeding and fattening cattle. It forms like- 
 wise one of the most powerful manures, being extensively 
 used in Europe, and tho effects of it are as immediate and 
 powerful as the best and most concentrated manures hither- 
 to known. It is as immediate and powerful as guano, with 
 i his difference, that it benefits after crops more than guano 
 does. As a feed for cattle, it cannot be surpassed in its fat- 
 oaing qualities; pound for pound it has a greater effect than 
 the fresh seed itself. 

It is in the manufacture of oil from its seeds, that it de- 
 serves to have a distinguished place among the profitable 
 crops, profitable not only from pecuniary advantages, derived 
 directly from its cultivation, for in supposing that only a 
 minimum crop of twenty bushels should be raised, still, as 
 the price is generally nearer and sometimes over $4, than 
 $3J; such a low crop even at $70 gross per acre, is certain- 
 ly no despicable figure, when taken into account that the 
 value of this fodder will go nearly to pay the expense of its 
 cultivation, but the manufacture of its seeds into one of the 
 lest and most valuable oils, gives it a claim to great preemi- 
 nence, by the great services it thus renders to agriculture, 
 «nd to manufactures. 

The Rape Oil is one of the most valuable oils known in 
 the arts and manufactures; at once serviceable for burning, 
 eating, fulling, for the tanner, for the soap boiler, for ma- 
 chinery, &c, &c. 

This oil used for machinery, properly prepared, does not 
 gum as other oils do. 

Already is the attention of government directed to it, to 
 supply our light-houses on the coast, with a good burning 
 oil, as fish oil is constantly raising in price, and whale and 
 sperm fish getting scarcer every year, and particularly should 
 it happen, in the natural course of events, that tho price of 
 fish oils gets affected by the political changes which often 
 (against all calculations) are of such a nature as very materi- 
 ally to affect and enhance the price of all articles and pro- 
 duce which we derive through our navigation, and which 
 would particularly affect the price of oils, and raise them. 

In the article of oils, the prices would rise iinmeasureably. 
 not having as yet established the cultivation of plants, to 
 supply us with this, an article of the first necessity. 

We may then, and at a profit of manifest advantage, es- 
 tablish among us the cultivation of a most valuable plant, 
 for which the soil and climate of this country are favorable. 

Any one desirious to make a trial with one acre or more, 
 can obtain the seeds, either of the Spring or Winter Rape, 
 from C. B. Rogers, 29 Market street, or Paschall Morris & 
 Co., 269 Market street, Philadelphia, at 25 cents per pound; 
 at either of which places I may be addressed. 

As has been shown, the raising of Rapo Seed is very profit- 
 able when carefully attended to; the maunfacturing the seed 
 into oil is no less so, so that to a certain degree, combining 
 tho two together, can not fail to be highly remunerative, and 
 as worthy the attention of the capitalist as any agricultural 
 product with which we are acquainted. 

The solicitude with which the United States Government 
 are trying to introduce the cultivation of Colza or Rape 
 Seed, makes it desirable that some one or other should be 
 spirited enough to attempt its cultivation. The impotent 
 plea hitherto set up that it will not succeed in this country. 
 is frivolous and not attested by facts; the contrary I can 
 prove by any one paying me a visit, in Atlantic county, New 
 Jersey, where I have a small field growing beautifully. In 
 my reproduced article, cited above, I prove what can be 
 expected, as true returns in cash. Therefore I exhort all 
 who love their own interest, if nothing else, to make at least 
 a trial. 

I will continue to describe monthly, if possible, all the 
 oleaginous seeds that can be raised successfully here, aDd 
 any information about these matters I will cheerfully com- 
 municate. 

Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 
 The stated meeting of this society was held in the sa- 
 loon of the Assembly Buildings on Tuesday evening last, 
 tho President in the chair. The severity of the weather 
 precluded all attempt at a display of greenhouse plants. 
 A couple of interesting specimens were brought by Mr. 
 Cope's gardener — the Angroscvm Bilobum, an air plant, and 
 Nymphea Caerulea, and for the first time seen on the ta- 
 bles of the Society. The same contributor had a beautiful 
 basket of cut flowers and a pair of hand boquets. Mr. 
 Knorr's gardener,exhibited three hand boquets not in com- 
 petition. Of fruits— Mr. Vickroy had a fine display of Ap- 
 ples ; Mr. Baxter a collection of Pears, and Mr. Pettit a dish 
 of the Niles pear. Mr. Felton— a display of Vegetables. 
 Mr. Baldwin's gardener, some fine forced Lettuce, Redishos 
 and Cucumbers ; and Mr. Tucker's a brace of Cucumbers. 
 A small package of interesting cereal grains of California, 
 from Messrs. Cummings & Co., of San Francisco, were on
