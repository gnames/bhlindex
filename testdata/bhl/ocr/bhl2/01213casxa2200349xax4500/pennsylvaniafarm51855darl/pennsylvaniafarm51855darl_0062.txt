Rich's Cast Iron Beam Plow. 

The following letter from W. C. Rives, to the manu- 
 facturer of Rich's Iron Plow we copy from the Country 
 Gentleman. We have heard similar testimony here from 
 our farmers who have used it the past season. It opens 
 a furrow both wide and deep, with a very light draught 
 nnd can be recommended both for its strength and sim- 
 plicity. One particular advantage it has, is in an ar- 
 rangement, by which one beam is made to answer for 
 two or three sizes of mould boards, which can be taken 
 "ff or transfered, so as to answer for light or heavy 
 plowing. 

They are maufactured in this section of country by 
 Messers Pennock, of Kennet Square, and are for sale, at 
 their manufactory, at their warehouse Wilmington Del., 
 at D. W. Entrinken's Agricultural warehouse West Ches- 

ter, and in Philadeleliia, at P. Morris & Co's Agricultu- 
 ral warehouse corner Seventh and Market street, agents 
 for their machinery. 

My Dear Sir. — I take pleasure in recording here my 
 impressions of the performance of your plow (Rich's 
 Iron-Beam Patent) at Cobham to-day. Its work was 
 far more thorough and complete than that of any plow 
 I ever saw in operation before. The furrow opened by 
 it, was very generally 13 inches deep, and about 20 inch- 
 es wide, in hard and close land, and most effectually and 
 perfectly cleared out, none of the loosened earth falling 
 back into it. 

The trial of the plow was witnessed by many of my 
 neighbors, among whom I may mention Mr. T. K. Nel- 
 son, Mr. Jas. II. Ten-ill, Mr. J. H. Lewis, Mr. C. B. 
 Hopkins, Mr. Thos. Watson of Lousia, &c, all practical 
 men and most excellent judges of agricultural imple- 
 ments, and there is but one opinion among them as to 
 the superior and unexceptionable performance of your 
 plow. 

Wishing you equal success elsewhere in making this 
 valuable implement known to our agriaultnral brethern, 
 I am very truly and faithfully yours. W. C. Rives.
