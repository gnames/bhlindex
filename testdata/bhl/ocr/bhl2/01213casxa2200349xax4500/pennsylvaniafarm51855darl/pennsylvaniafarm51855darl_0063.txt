Tartar Sheep. 

In the report of the last State Exhibition our attention 
 has been called to an error in the statement of the com- 
 mittee respecting the Tartar or Shanghai sheep. They 
 say, "they breed twice a year, and have from four to six 
 lambs at a birth." This is of ctfurse an error. They 
 breed twice a year, but have two to four lambs at a 
 birth instead of six, never exceeding four that we have 
 heard of. The importers were Messrs, William Piatt & 
 â™¦Sons, of Philadelphia, relatives of Mr. Anthony T. New- 
 bold, also of Philadelphia, who exhibited them. 

These Tartar sheep are quite a curiosity. They are 
 represented as very hardy and weighing about the aver- 

rage of our common sheep. They were imported from 
 Shanghai in the clipper ship White Squall in the spring 
 of 1852. Dr. Emerson, who procured a pair of them, 
 informs us that the ewe brought forth three lambs last 
 February, all of which were raised, and two more lively 
 lambs last November. The wool is coarse, but adapted 
 well for blankets, carpets, &c, and the mutton has the 
 reputation of being unsurpassed by any other, for fine 
 delicate flavor, fully equal to Southdown. The faces of 
 the Tartar sheep are covered with a short, glossy hair.

IMPORTED DURHAM COW ROSE. 

The above is a very correct portrait of the beautiful 
 Durham cow, Rose, owned by Christopher Fallon, Esq., 
 of Philadelphia, and to be seen at his farm in Upper 
 Darby township, Delaware county, Pa. She was impor- 
 ted by Mr. Fallon in August last, together with three 
 other superior Durham animals, Nelly 4 years, Lilly 
 11 months, and the Bull Turk, 8 months old. 

The introduction of these fine cattle is a valuable ac- 
 quisition to this section of the country, and creditable 
 to the public spirit and enterprise of their owner. Un- 
 der the efficient management of his able and experien- 
 ced superintendent, George Drayton, we may expect 
 their progeny to fully sustain the reputation of the 
 breed.

Rose was four years old in August last, is of dappled 
 roan color, with very small horns, and neat head ,and 
 neck, indicating purity of blood ; she had a fine heifer 
 calf last November. 

She was selected expressly for Mr. Fallon, from one 
 of the best dairy districts in England, by an experien- 
 ced judge, and took the first premium of $20, at the 
 late Pennsylvania State exhibition, for the best cow im- 
 ported within 12 months. 

She also took the first premium for the best cow at 
 the Delaware County exhibition in 1854. 

Nelly, imported in the same vessel with Rose, had a 
 bull calf, last December, which we understand is for 
 sale.
