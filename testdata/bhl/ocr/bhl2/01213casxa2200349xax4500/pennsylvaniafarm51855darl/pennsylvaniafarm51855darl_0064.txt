Annual Meeting of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural 
 Society. 

The Annual Meeting of the Pennsylvania State Agricul- 
 tural Society was held on Tuesday, the 10th of January, as 
 required by its constitution, in the II all of the House of 
 Representatives at Harrisburg. In the absence of the Pres- 
 ident, Judge Watts, the Hon. John H. Ewing, one of the 
 Vice-Presidents, was called to the chair. The Recording 
 Secretary, R. C. Walker, Esq., read the Report of the Ex- 
 ecutive Committoe, which was unanimously adopted. It is 
 as follows : 

To the Members of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural So- 
 ciety : â€” 

The ending of the fourth year in the transactions of the 
 Pennsylvania State Agricultural Society, finds it in a posi- 
 tion both creditable to the State and worthy of the cause 
 intended to be benefitted. A great end has been accom- 
 plished in a short time, and a period has arrived when your 
 Society can step forth untrainelled from the pecuniary em- 
 barrassment which has retarded other State Societies, and 
 render material aid in fostering institutions for the benefit 
 of the farmer and promotion of agriculture. 

Since the memorable convention of farmers, which estab- 
 lished this Society, in 1851, the spirit then infused has con- 
 tinued with unabated fervency, and each succeeding year 
 has outstripped its predecessor in adding to the accumulated 
 benefit, until the year 1855 presents the pleasing spectacle 
 of a Society, although in its infancy, capable of assuming 
 and maintaining a rank with those of longer standing and 
 earlier birth. 

The Executive Committee, who transact all the business 
 of the Society, have regularly met during the past year, as 
 required by the constitution, and have disposed of all mat- 
 ters that were brought before them for their action. 

At their meeting of the 14th of March, 1S54, the follow- 
 ing Preamble and Resolutions were offered by James Gow- 
 on, Esq., and unanimously adopted : 

"The death of Elliott Cresson, Esq., which occurred at 
 Philadelphia on the 20th of February, 1S54, in the 58th year 
 of his age, has left a void in the ranks of philanthropy, 
 benevolence and private worth, difficult to bo supplied or 
 filled, causing a deep sensation of sorrow and regret that 
 his labors in the broad field of human rights and human 
 progress had not been vouchsafed a longer day, with a slow- 
 er setting sun, for the further development of his noble ef- 
 forts, and to mitigate the grief of his bereaved relatives and 
 friends. But they and the whole community have the con- 
 solation to reflect that however short his probation, he did 
 not live in vain ; and "though dead he yet speaketh" in the 
 memorials he has left for their example and contemplation. 
 In these regrets and in these memorials, this Society is deep- 
 ly a sympathiser and most gratefully a debtor. 

"Resolved, That this Society, at its first meeting since 
 the decease of the lamented Elliott Cresson, offers its tribute 
 of regret for the sudden and unexpected loss it and the com- 
 munity have sustained in the death of an enlightened phi- 
 lanthropist, an upright, benevolent citizen, and a public 
 spirited benefactor. 

"Resolved, That the generous bequest of five thousand 
 dollars to this Society, by the will of the late Elliott Cres- 
 son, towards the erection and support of an Agricultural 
 College demands our grateful and unfeigned thanks, and 
 commands the sympathy and respect of eveiy farmer 
 throughout the land. 

"Resolved, That the Pennsylvania State Agricultural 
 Society will and do hereby accept the bequest made to it by 
 the will of the late Elliott Cresson, Esq., and hereby pledge 

the Society to the faithful application of the same to the ob- 
 ject designated by the will of the deceased. 

"Resolved, That these proceedings be published in the 
 daily and weekly papers of Philadelphia and Harrisburg, 
 and that a copy of the same be presented to his venerable 
 lady mother, as a token of the Pennsylvania State Agricul- 
 tural Society's respect and gratitude to the memory of her 
 noble son, and of deep sympathy in her bereavement." 

In accordance with a resolution instructing the Secretary 
 to procure a medal-die, one had been furnished upon which 
 the medals for the late exhibition have been struck. Through 
 the courtesy of James Ross Snowdon, Esq., of the United 
 States Mint at Philadelphia, the medals were there struck 
 off, and the die then placed in safe keeping for the future 
 use of the Society. The artistic execution of the dio is 
 pronounced good, and was done by A. C. Morin, No. 80 
 Walnut street, Philadelphia. 

According to a similar resolution of instruction, three 
 hundred copies of the first volume of the transactions of this 
 Society, as authorized to be published by the Legislature, 
 have been procured from A. Boyd Hamilton, State Printer, 
 a part of which still remain in the Library. 

The life members of the Society now number seventy- 
 four, while the annual members exceed eight thousand. 
 The amount thus received from life members is compara- 
 tively small, but can by another year with a proper effort be 
 increased probably ten fold. 

The County Agricultural Societies have increased sinr-e 
 our last annual meeting until there is one in almost every 
 county in the State, the reports of which, had they all been 
 communicated to the State Society, would no doubt have 
 furnished desirable statistics from every part of the Com- 
 monwealth, which would add greatly to the information al- 
 ready obtained from some of .hese beneficial auxilliaries. 

The Fourth Annual Exhibition was held in the twenty - 
 fourth ward of the City of Philadelphia, on the 26th, 27tl , 
 28th and 29th days of September last. The grounds used 
 for the occasion were those known as the Powelton ami 
 Bingham estates, the use of which was gratuitously tender- 
 ed the ooci^y by the Board of Directors of the Pennsylva- 
 nia Railroad Company, and were in every way peculiarly 
 adapted to the uses of such an exhibition. The fair was 
 one of unusual attraction, and in amount of numbers in at - 
 tendance, it exceeded any other exhibition probably ever 
 held in the United States. The entry of articles and ani- 
 mals for exhibition on the books of the r . _iety outnumbers 
 by far the entry of any preceding year, and the whole fail- 
 in every department, like the Society itself, attained a great- 
 ness far beyond the anticipations of its most sanguino 
 friends. 

The premium list, as published for the exhibition, and in- 
 cluding phxto offered, and the premium list of the Pennsyl- 
 vania Horticultural Society, which was adopted in addition, 
 amounted to over eight thousand dollars, and the premiums 
 themselves in every class were considerably larger than 
 those of the preceding ^ear. Fifty-four silver medals and 
 one hundred and twenty diplomas wore awarded and deliv- 
 ered. 

It was expected that tMe Hon. Wm. M. Meredith, who hail 
 been invited foi the occasion, would have delivered the cus- 
 tomary annual address, but from indisposition he was un 
 able to add to the exhibition this attractive feature. 

Dr. Bryan, a gentleman of considerable experience in 
 veterinary science, delivered a lecture on the fair ground 
 upon this subject, the manuscript of which has been obtain- 
 ed for the Society.
