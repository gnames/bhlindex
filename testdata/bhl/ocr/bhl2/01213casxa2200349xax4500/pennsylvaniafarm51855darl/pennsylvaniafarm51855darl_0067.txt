of cultivating the soil ; and inasmuch as the "act to incor- 
 porate the Farmers' High School of Pennsylvania," passed 
 at the last session of the Legislature was, unfortunately, so 
 defective as to prevent an organization under it, the present 
 Legislature is earnestly invoked to modify said act in such 
 manner as to secure the establishment of this most invalua- 
 ble institution at the earliest practicable period. 

On motion of Mr. Stavely, it was resolved that when the 
 meeting adjourns it adjourns to meet at half past seven 
 o'clock this evening. 

Previous to the adjournment, Mr. Ewing, observing the 
 President in the Hall, signified a wish to vacate the Chair, 
 and after a few forcible and eloquent remarks gave place to 
 Mr. Gowen, who upon taking the chair spoke as follows : 

Gentlemen: — I return you my sincere thanks for the 
 honor you have done me in electing me President of this 
 Society for the current year. With the profound sense of 
 the obligation conferred, I must also acknowledge the ap- 
 prehensions I feel that the time I can devote, as well as the 
 ability I possess, will be inadequate to the proper discharge 
 of the duties of the office to which you have elected me. 
 But one thing I can promise, in all confidence, and that is, 
 that whatever I can do to promote the interests of the So- 
 ciety shall be done zealously and faithfully. It becomes me 
 likewise to say that I consider it an honor to have been 
 chosen to fill the place vacated by my predecessor, the Hon. 
 Frederick Watts, who so ably presided over the Society since 
 its organization. 

A resolution of thanks was tendered to the Hon. John H. 
 Ewing, for the able manner in which he had presided at the 
 meeting. 

Adjourned till half past seven o'clock. 

EVENING SESSION. 

A. L. Kennedy offered the following amendment to the 
 fourth section of the constitution, which was not agreed to. 
 Strike out last clause and insert : 

"At the time and place of the annual exhibition, there 
 shall be held, under the auspices of this Society, a Conven- 
 tion of Delegates appointed for the purpose by the County 
 Agricultural Societies, which convention shall elect its own 
 officers, and be, in all respects, auxilliary to this Society." 

On motion of William Stavely, the first section of the 
 constitution was amended so as to read : 

"The Society shall consist of all such persons as shall pay 
 to the Treasurer not less than one dollar, and annually 
 thereafter not less than one dollar ; the names of the mem- 
 bers to be recorded by the Secretary." 

On motion, it was resolved that the thanks of this Society 
 be tendered to the members of the House of Representatives 
 for the use of their Hall. 

On motion the Society adjourned. 

Classification of Manures. 

BY JOHN P. NORTON. 

Of Animal Manures. — We will now take up the second 
 class, the animal manures. These comprise the blood, flesh, 
 hair, horns, bones and excrements of animals. Manures of 
 this class are more powerful by far than the vegetable ma- 
 nures, because they contain so much more nitrogen. I now 
 simply state this fact ; the reason why nitrogen is so effica- 
 cious will be given in a subsequent chapter. Blood and 
 flesh are among the most valuable of all ; wherever they can 
 be obtained, they should be secured at once, and either 
 buried or made into compost. All of the offal from slaugh- 
 ter houses is of much value. Though in this country it is 
 often entirely wasted. 

It is not uncommon, in many districts, to see horses or 

cattle that die from disease drawn out to some secluded spot, 
 and there left to decay on the surface. These are known to 
 be some of the most powerful manures that the farmer could 
 obtain ; equal to guano, poudrette, or any other more costly 
 fertilizers. Every animal that dies should be made into 
 compost, or buried in pieces at once. The best plan is to 
 separate the flesh, which decomposes readily and produces 
 an immediate effect, and make use of the bones according to 
 some of the methods to be hereafter described. 

The hair of animals is an exceedingly rich material ; for 
 this reason woollen rags, and the waste from woollen mills, 
 are both considered valuable in England ; they are sold 
 there at from $20 to $40 per ton, and are eagerly sought 
 after at these prices, as not only very fertilizing, but also 
 very lasting in the soil. All of the hair obtained from tho 
 furs of animals is there scrupulously saved, and sold at a 
 high price. Twenty or thirty bushels per aero produce an 
 excellent effect. 

All these parts of tho animal leave an ash corresponding 
 with that of plants in the substances which it contains, with 
 the single exception of silica ; this does not seem to enter 
 into the composition of the animal. We are then now able 
 to point out distinctions between the inorganic matter in the 
 soil, in the plant, and in the animal. They all contain the 
 same substances, if we omit silica and alumina. 

Of Bones. — There is one important part of the animal 
 yet unnoticed, that is, the bones. Their composition is, 
 when dry, earthy matter about 60 lbs. in 100 lbs., and organ- 
 ic matter, that burns away, about 34 lbs. 

The earthy matter consists for the most part of phosphate 
 of lime, that is, lime in combination with phosphoric acid ; 
 these, as already shown, are two most valuable substances 
 for application to any soil. 

The organic part is called gelatin, or glue; this is boiled 
 out by the glue-makers ; it is extremely rich in nitrogen, 
 and is therefore an excellent manure. We thus see at once 
 how important a source of nourishment for our land is to be 
 found in bones. They unite from the above statement, some 
 of the most efficacious and desirable organic and inorganic 
 manures. Both of these parts are fitted to minister power- 
 fully to the growth of the plant. 

When the bones are applied whole, the effect is not very 
 marked at first, because they decay slowly in the soil ; it is 
 also necessary to put on a large quantity per acre. The 
 best way is to have them crushed to powder, or to fine frag- 
 ments in mills. Ten bushels of dust will produce a more 
 immediate and abundant result than 80 or 100 bushels of 
 whole bones, although of course the effect will be sooner 
 over. An advantageous way of using them is to put on 8 
 or 10 bushels of dust per acre, and half the usual quantity 
 of farm-yard manure. 

Boiled bones that have been used by the glue-makers are 
 still quite valuable ; they have lost the greater part of their 
 gelatine, but the phosphates remain, and the. bones are so 
 softened by the long boiling that they have undergone, as 
 to decompose quickly, and afford an immediate supply of 
 food to plants. 

Another most important form of applying bones is in a 
 state of solution by sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol). This is a 
 cheap substance, costing by the carboy not more than 2£ to 
 3 cents per lb. To every 100 lbs. of bones, about 50 or 60 of 
 acid are taken; if bone dust is used 25 to 45 lbs. of acid ere 
 sufficient. The acid must be mixed with two or three times 
 its bulk of water, because if applied strong it would only 
 burn and blacken the bones without dissolving them. 

The bones are placed in a tub, and a portion of the pre- 
 viously diluted acid poured upon them. After standing a 
 day, another portion of acid may be poured on; and finally
