the last on the third day, if they are not already dissolved. 
 The mass should be often stirred. 

Another good way is to place the bones in a hoap upon 
 any convenient floor, and pour a portion of the acid upon 
 them. After standing half a day, the heap should be thor- 
 oughly mixed, and a little more acid added; this to be con- 
 tinued as long as necessary. It is a method which I have 
 known to prove very successful. 

In either ease the bones will ultimately soften and dis- 
 solve to a kind of paste; this may be mixed with twenty or' 
 thirty times its bulk of water, and applied by means of an 
 ordinary water cart; used in this way, it produces a won- 
 derful effect upon nearly all crops. 

A more convenient method in most cases is to thoroughly 
 mix the pasty mass of dissolved bones with a large quantity 
 of ashes, peat earth, saw-dust, or charcoal dust. It can then 
 be sown by hand, or dropped from a drilling machine. Two 
 or three bushels of these dissolved bones, with half the 
 quantity of yard manure, are sufficient for an acre. This is, 
 therefore, an exceedingly powerful fertilizer. One reason 
 for its remarkable effect is, that the bones are, by dissolving, 
 brought into a 6tate of such minute division that they are at 
 <mce available for the plant. A peculiar phosphate of lime 
 is formed, called by chemists a superphosphate, which is very 
 xoluble ; and in addition to this, we have the sulphuric acid, 
 of itself an excellent application to most soils. 

Bones are useful in nearly every district, and are peculiar- 
 ly adapted to all, or at least to most of those situations where 
 the land, without heavy manuring, no longer bears good 
 wheat, or Indian corn, or other grains. In a great majority 
 of cases where the land is run down by grain cropping, the 
 use of bones, in some of the forms above mentioned, is of 
 all things the most likely to meet the deficiency. It will be 
 remembered that the ash of grain is peculiarly rich in phos- 
 phates ; consequently, as grain is generally sold off, the 
 phosphates are most readily exhausted ; in bones, therefore, 
 we find just the manure for restoring them, and with little 
 oxpense. This has been already tried in some parts of the 
 country, and with most encouraging success. I would par- 
 ticularly recommend farmers to experiment with bones dis- 
 solved in sulphuric acid. The dissolving them is a simple 
 business. The cheapness of this manure is a groat recom- 
 mendation. Two bushels of bones would not certainly cost 
 more than $1,* then say 50 lbs. of acid to dissolve them, 
 would cost by the carboy $1.50, making only $2.50 for a 
 quantity quite sufficient for an acre, with half the usual 
 <!ressing of farm-yard manure. It would be worth almost 
 ?.s much as this to cart the common manure from the yard, 
 to say nothing of its value. There are few c farrns on which 
 '■ones enough might not bo collected in the course of a year 
 to help out in this way the manuring of several acres. 

Bones may not only be applied to the ordinary cultivated 
 t rops, but also to meadows and pastures. In some of the 
 wider dairy districts, a few bushels of bone dust per acre 
 will at once restoro worn out pastures. The reason is, that 
 the milk and cheese which are in one form or another sold 
 and carried away, contain considerable quantities of phos- 
 phates in their ash. These are restored to the land by bones. 
 It is calculated by Professor Johnson that a cow giving 20 
 quarts of milk per lay, takes from the soil about 2 lbs. of 
 phosphate of lime or bone earth in each week. There 
 would thus be required three or four pounds of bones to 
 make good this loss. If it is not made good in some way, 
 the rich grasses after a time cease to flourish ; being suc- 
 ceeded by those which require less phosphate of lime, and 
 therefore do not furnish when eaten by the cow so rich or so 
 abundant milk. 

*The present price here is SI 20. 

All of these uses of bones which have been described are 
 understood and appreciated in England; so much so, that 
 the bones are all collected with the most scrupulous care, and 
 are even imported from every other country where they can 
 be advantageously obtained. It is to be hoped that the 
 great waste of them in this country will soon cease, and that 
 they will be eagerly sought after by American farmers.

Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture, stated 
 meeting at the Society rooms, Masonic Hall, South Third 
 Street, on Monday morning, January 3rd, 1855. 

President, Dr. Alfred L. Elwyn, in the chair. 

The minutes of the proceeding meeting were read and 
 approved. The following gentleman proposed at the pre- 
 vious meeting were elected resident members: — Thomas 
 Drake, Edgar Black, William G. Warder and Henry Grambo, 
 of Philadelphia, and James Sloan, of Montgomery county. 
 Mr. Davis S. Brown presented to the Society for distribu- 
 tion a number of copies in pamphlet form of the letter 
 of Mr. Davis M. Stone, of the New York Journal of Com- 
 merce, to the Wool-growers; also copies of the New York 
 Evening Post containing an article on the same subject. 

Mr. Brown accompanies the donation with an interesting 
 account of the manufacture of woollens in the United States; 
 in the course of which he states that the discriminating duty 
 on wool, which had been designed to benefit the manufactur- 
 ers has actually proved so injurious that the mills, for finer 
 labors were nearly all closed. He referred especially to the 
 manufacture of broadcloths. In such goods the warp was 
 formed of American wool, for which purpose such wool was 
 eminently adapted; but for the woof, filling and face of fine 
 cloths, foreign wool was found indispensable. This wool the 
 present tariff almost excluded from our market, and one by 
 one, the broadcloth mills had stopped until the last, that of 
 Mr. Slater, of Rhode Island, (whose father was one of the 
 first to introduce the making of broadcloths into this coun- 
 try) had ceased its operations. Mr. Brown did not vouch 
 for the correctness of the view entertained by workmen, 
 but he knew that they asserted the superiority of Saxon 
 wool for the above purposes, to the fact that in Germany 
 they sheared their sheep twice a year. Certainly, German 
 cloths at the present rate of duty wero fast driving all others 
 out'of the market. A removal of the duty on wool altogeth- 
 er, would probably open the way for the unprecedented in- 
 crease in the manufacture of American broad cloths. No 
 bettor state of the trade was possible than that of freedom 
 from all duty. This was true both of wool and dye-stuffs ; 
 if we admit them free the price of wool in all other markets 
 would at once be raised ; for certain fabrics, our wool was 
 in demand; it was more flexible, longer, and a larger quanti- 
 ty of it was finer than the European and Australian wool. 
 Great Britian has freely opened the raw materials of the 
 world to her manufacturers. In the United States where 
 money-rates and labor are higher we cannot expect succest- 
 unless we imitate her. Our wool for the making of flannels* 
 and fancy cashmeres was equal to any other. South Amer- 
 ican wool was well adapted to the manufacture of blankets, 
 but for other purposes it required to be mixed with that of 
 our country. The French manufacturers found our wool 
 more flexible and abundantly suited to making Merinos and 
 worsted goods. 

Mr. SpAnrler reminded the members that the wool which 
 had taken the first premium at the World's Fair, London, 
 was from Tennessee.
