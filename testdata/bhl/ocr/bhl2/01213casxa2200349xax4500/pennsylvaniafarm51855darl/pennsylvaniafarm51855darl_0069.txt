inferiority of American wool arose from our merchants fail- 
 ug to discriminate qualities in the purohase. They pay too 
 much for the whole fleece without sorting. 

Mr. Aaron Clement presented the following communica- 
 tion on the "Tartar Sheep" : — The Tartar or Shanghai Sheep 
 lately introduced into this country exhibited some very pe- 
 culiar characteristics. They are of fine size with broad tails, 
 prominent noses, drooping ears and very agreeable counte- 
 nances. The fleece is light and only suited for blanketings 
 sad other coarse woollen fabrics. The mutton is highly es- 
 teemed, being free from all rank or woolly flavor. Perhaps 
 the most distinguished characteristic of the Tartar sheep is 
 their numerous offspring, the ewes having lambs every spring 
 •nid fall, and from two to four at a time. Dr. Emerson, of 
 Philadelphia, who obtained a pair of the original stock, states 
 that one of his ewes had three lambs last February, all of 
 which have been raised ; about the middle of November 
 •die had two more, whilst at the same time, two of her Feb- 
 ruary lambs had each a lamb, making her a grandmother 
 within nine months, and her progeny within that time no 
 less than seven. The Doctor crossed the Shanghai stock 
 with an excellent breed of the country, by which the carcase 
 lias been increased, and the fleece much improved. Proba- 
 bly this will be moderated to a point which may render them 
 more acceptable to many, than the full bloods. I have a 
 buck and ewe of these half bloods, now with mo, which are 
 certainly very fine stock, and well worth the attention of all 
 persons who take an interest in sheep, especially those who 
 look to profit more from the lambs and mutton than from 
 the fleece." 

Dr. Emerson requested Mr. Newbold to relate his ex- 
 perience with the Tartar sheep. 

Mr. Newbold had two ewes seven months old, one of 
 which has had two and the other three lambs. The old ewe 
 has had seven lambs within twelve months; the usual num- 
 ber at a birth Was three, but his friend Dr. Emerson had 
 a ewe which died from an injury received a few days before 
 her "term", in which in dissection four fetus were found. 
 Tho wool was not fine, it would neither full nor felt and 
 was unshrinkable. 

Mr. 0. Sheridan doubted if any ewe could furnish milk 
 ftnough to support, two or three lambs. His South-Downs 
 Kartainly could not. Dr. Emerson remarked that the ca- 
 pacity to furnish milk has been proven by his owes, two of 
 which had raised their lambs without any assistance. 

Mr. Sheridan moved "that the Executive committee be 
 requested to report at next meeting on the expediency of 
 the Society having an exhibition next autumn," which mo- 
 tion was postponed until after the election of officers. 

On motion that the annual election be now held, which 
 was so resolved ; and Messrs. H. Ingersoll and W. Harrison 
 were appointed Tellers 

Dr. Elwyn stated that having served the Society as Pres- 
 ident for two terms, he was according to XIX By-laws, al- 
 though nominated for re-election, no longer eligible ; he 
 must therefore decline being a candidate. 

The election being held resulted as follows i — President, 
 D. Landreth; Vice President, A. T. Newbold and Aaron 
 Clement; Corresponding Secretary, S. G. Fisher; Recording 
 Secretary, Alfred L. Kennedy; Assistant Secretarg, P. R. 
 Freas ; Executive Committee, Dennis Kelly, A. S. Roberts, 
 A. T. Newbold, Saml. Williams, John Lardner and Jehu 
 McGowan. 

Dr. Kennedy offered the following Resolution which was 
 unanimously adopted. Resolved, that tho thanks of the Soci- 
 ety be, and they are hereby tended to Dr. A. L. Elw3 T n for 
 the courteous and impartial manner in which he has per- 
 formed the duties of President during the last two years. 

Dr. Elwyn reminded the Society that they had frequently, 
 during the past ten years, entertained the proposition to es- 
 tablish an Agricultural Reading Room, to be opened on Tues- 
 day and Friday evening and through tho day. He deemed 
 the present an eligible time to carry out the plan, inasmuch 
 as the Society would ere long be compelled to find new ac- 
 commodations. 

Mr. Spangler approved highly of the views expressed 
 by the last speaker. 

Dr. Eewyn announced that the next session of the 
 State Society would be held at Harrisburg on the 16th inst. 

Tho Chair deemed the occasion of that meeting a proper 
 one on which to represent to the Legislature tho great 
 wrong done to the Society and the cause of Agriculture, 
 in this section of the State, by the withdrawal of our annual 
 appropriation, which had been continued uninterruptedly for 
 so many years. On motion of Mr. Spangler, those of our 
 members who attend the session of the State Society were 
 appointed a committee to present our claims to the Legis- 
 lature. On motion adjourned. 

Price of Land. 
 J. L. Darlington, Esq: — In compliance with a para- 
 graph of an editorial in the last number of your valuable 
 Journal, headed, "Price of Land," I will give you a short 
 sketch of the prices of land and produco, as well as the mar- 
 ket facilities of Schuylkill County. Farms distant from 
 four to ten and twelve miles from tho great Coal Region, of 
 this great Coal county, are really more valuable, than in 
 generally supposed, by persons who live out of it, or ; have 
 not visted the county, except by a hasty flight on the nume- 
 rous Railroads that connect like a network, giving life and 
 bustle wherever they lead, which are mostly located where 
 very little farming is done. Nor can a person form a cor- 
 rect idea of the extent of the Agricultural portions of the 
 county, Unless he leaves the railroad at Orwigsburg, at least, 
 and travel through the valleys, leading from the eastern 
 parts of the county, in a south-west course, beyond Pine- 
 Grove. Farms susceptible of being made profitable, by a 
 judicious course of farming and improvement, in the valley? 
 south of the Sharp Mountain, now but poorly managed, for 
 want of better farmers, can be bought from twenty to fifty 
 dollars per acre; others, under better management, owned 
 or cultivated by the best farmers in the county, will bring 
 from fifty to seventy-five, and some as high as ono hundred 
 dollars per acre, much depending on the quality of tho soil 
 and location. Tho advantages of a near and good market, 
 in the numerous towns in the Coal Region, for every thing 
 the farmer can produce, are incalculable. A load of hay 
 can be packed in the morning, taken to Pottsvillo, or any 
 other place in the region, you choose, sold from twenty to 
 twenty-five, and even as high as thirty dollars a ton, when 
 you can return with a load of manure, in time to take sup- 
 per with the family circle. Every thing readily sells at 
 proportionably high prices. Wo have farmers among uc 
 coming from near Philadelphia, who say that the truck and 
 dairy business pays them better prices at Pottsvillo, than at 
 Philadelphia, which is evident from tho fact, that thousands 
 of dollars worth of vegetables, and small fruit, are annually 
 bought in Philadelphia, and sent by the Reading Railroad 
 to Pottsville, and in fact to all parts of the densely inhabited 
 Coal Region, to supply the wants of the thousands of opera- 
 tives and other classes The same holds true to all the 
 coarser produce, such as hay, grain, flour, potatoes, <tc. 
 Melons, peaches, pears, apples and other fruit suitablo to tin- 
 climate, can be produced here, of as good quality as in anj 
 part of Pennsylvania; which fact I can vouch for, from hit 
 own experience. I should be happy to welcome some of
