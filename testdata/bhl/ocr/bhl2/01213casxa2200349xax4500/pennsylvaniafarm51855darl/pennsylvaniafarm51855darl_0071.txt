READING'S PATENT HORSE POWER CORN SHELLER AND CLEANER. 

Robert Sinclair, Jr. & Co. of Baltimore, have pur- 
 chased the right to make and sell Reading's celebrated 
 Corn Sheller and Cleaner, as represented by the figure 
 which is admirably adapted for large corn planters, and 
 the best Horse Power Machine known. It is estimated 
 to shell, cob, and clean, in perfect order, 1,500 to 2,000 
 bushels of Corn per day. 

The works are remarkably simple, the machine being 
 made without springs, or cog gearing, and in every res- 
 pect a machine particularly desirable for shelling large 
 crops. Price including Fan Attachment, as represen- 
 ted by the Figure, - - - $60 00 
 Same Machine without the Fan, (see Figure in 

last Number.) "... 45 qq 

VOSE'S OX YOKE, PATENTED AUGUST 10TH, 1853. 

"Muzzle not the Ox that treadeth out the Corn." 
 In all history, the ox is associated with man as his 
 faithful servant. The horse has been rather man's com- 
 panion ; and, therefore, caressed and apostrophised. 
 And when it has been found necessary to take him from 
 the chariot to the wagon, every care has been taken, 
 both in an anatomical and mechanical point of view, to 
 have his harness constructed soft and flexile and on the 
 best principles. None, or but little of this care has 
 been taken in connexion with the ox. It is true he has 
 been worshipped as a God, and sacrificed to the gods, 
 but he has never been caressed — has never, when he 
 has been whipped and cudgelled, had any of those good 
 natnred apologies made to him that, after ill treatment, 
 are usually made to a horse. If his harness, by its 
 malformation and rudeness, pained and lacerated his 
 flesh, it made no matter — he was only an ox. And yet 
 in man's sober moments — perhaps we should say in h s 
 lazy moments, when he had nothing to do but pity — 
 this consideration and treatment of this truly useful an- 

imal, has been mourned over and condemned. It now 
 must give to all men real pleasure to see what th is pity 
 gives us, as in this last view of the case, we know it 
 has at last mercifully worked itself into form — into real 
 practical alleviation. It is but a few years since a 
 yoke was invented, by which the oxen can walk closer 
 or more apart as the inequalities or other circumstances 
 of the ground, may make it desirable. And now, we 
 have another and more important improvement in this 
 second new yoke, of which the above is a cut. If the 
 first, or sliding yoke, is a convenience to the oxen, this 
 yoke embraces a principle of mercy as well as of me- 
 chanical improvement, as in it the oxen's shoulders 
 cannot possibly be chafed or mangled, as they too fre- 
 quently are in the old or common yoke. 

In this yofe« tbe neck blocks are separate from the 
 beam, and attached to it by strong bolts passing from 
 an iron thimble or socket in the block up through the 
 centre of the beam, as represented at the letter B. Tins 
 iron thimble or socket, is an improvement upon which
