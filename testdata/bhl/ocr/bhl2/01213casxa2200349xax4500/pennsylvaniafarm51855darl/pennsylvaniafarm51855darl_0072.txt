application for a patent is now being made by Mr. Ded- 
 oii'ck. This yoke has five decided advantages over all 
 others : First. By the neck block accommodating it- 
 self to whatever movement of the ox, it is impossible 
 for his shoulders ever to become sore or broken. Second. 
 It does away with the evil arising from one ox stepping 
 in advance of the other : as, by the moving of the 
 blocks, the weight must under all possible circumstances 
 fall equally on both oxen — except, (which is the Third 
 advantage,) when desiring to favor one you may move 
 him one or more holes farther from the centre than his 
 fellow. Fourth. By moving the neck blocks into either 
 of the five holes, (represented by dots in the beam be- 
 low,) it can be changed at pleasure into a yoke of any 
 width required for ploughing, carting, sleighing or haul- 
 ing ; which advantage of itself makes its value equal to 
 two or three of the common yoke. Fifth. Bows in tins 
 yoke will last much longer than in any other, because 
 the tugging or jerking of the ox does not fall on the 
 bow, but directly on the centre bolt. The bows are se- 
 cured by keys passing through the bows and neck 
 blocks represented at A'. A. — there-being in each block 
 two or more holes, so that the r bow can be raised or low- 
 ered at pleasure. 

These yokes are manufactured by Deering & Dickson, 
 of the premium works at Albany; and we believe are for 
 sale by Paschall "Morris & Co., of this city. "We believe 
 its price (patent right included,) is seven dollars; and 
 we feel that we should not conclude this article without 
 Faying, that when the great ease and advantage it gives 
 to the oxen is considered, no intelligent or humane far- 
 mer should allow the two or three dollars difference in 
 price between it and the ordinary yoke, to make him 
 hesitate a moment in its purchase. 

Curculio Remedy. 

The appointed several Horticultural Societies, to test 
 the merit of the alleged discovery by Mr. Mathews, of 
 Ohio, of an effectual remedy against the curculio, have 
 reported their success the past season, but wish to give it 
 fill trial another season also, before pronouncing a final 
 <pinion. No intimation is given of the nature of the 
 remedy, but so far as tried, there is some reason to hope 
 this hitherto insuperable obstacle to the successful cul- 
 tire of a most delightful fruit may be obviated. 

The trial of another year will be looked for with the 
 r reatest interest. 

Farmers' Creed. 

I believe in small farms and thorough cultivation. 

I believe that the soil loves to eat, as well as its own- 
 er, and ought, therefore, to be manured. 

I believe in large crops, which leaves the land better 
 than they found it, making both the farmer and the farm 
 rich at once. 

I believe in going to the bottom of things, and, there- 
 fore, in deep plowing, and enough of it, all the better if 
 with a subsoil plow. 

I believe that every farmer should own a good farm. 

I believe that the best fertilizer of any soil is a spirit 
 o' industry, enterprise and intelligence. AVithout this, 
 iime and gypsum, bones and green manure, marl and 
 guano, will be of little use. 

I believe in good fences, good barns, good farm hous- 

es, good stock, good orchards, and children enough to 
 gather the fruit. 

I believe in a clean kitchen, a neat wife in it, a spin- 
 ning piano, a clean cupboard, a clean dairy and a clear 
 conscience. 

I disbelieve in farmers that will not improve their 
 farms, that grow poorer every year, starving cattle, far- ( 
 mers' boys turned into clerks and merchants, and far- 
 mers' daughters unwilling to work ; and in all farmer? 
 that are ashamed of their vocation, or who drink whis- 
 key till all honest men are ashamed of them. 

I will also add — I believe in supporting our County 
 and State Agricultural Societies. 

I believe in having a well filled agricultural library. 

I believe in supporting the agricultural papers of our 
 State, paying for them, reading them, and circulating 
 them among my neighbors. — Ohio Cultivator. 

Smithfield Club Cattle Show. 

AVe have full reports of this justly celebrated exhibi- 
 tion of fat cattle, sheep, pigs, &c, but our space this 
 week forbids an extended notice. The Gold Medal for 
 the best steer or ox of any breed or class was awarded 
 to the Duke of Portland, for a Short-horn, 4 years and 4 
 months old. He was "probably never excelled for qual- 
 ity ; very fat but evenly so ; extraordinary thick in the 
 twist and rump, and very fully covered on all the most 
 valuable parts. , The Gold Medal for the best heifer or 
 cow of any breed was given to a Short-horn cow, 6 years 
 and 8 months old, belonging to Charles Townley, of 
 Burnley. The Short-Horns have now for three years in 
 succession carried off these prizes. The Gold Medal for 
 the best pen of long wooled sheep of any breed or class 
 was awarded to three pure bred Leicester wethers, 21 
 months old, bred and fed by the Marquis of Exeter. 
 The Gold Medal for the best pen of one year old short 
 wooled sheep of any breed or class was awarded to three 
 South Down wethers, bred by the Duke of Richmond. 
 The Gold Medal for the best pen of pigs of any breed or 
 class was awarded to J. V. Williams, Bridgewater, 
 Somerset, for three improved Leicesters 17 weeks old, 
 color black, with very thin hair. 

The special correspondent of the 3Iark Lane Express, 
 says "the classes of Short-horns quite bear the palm at 
 this meeting, and as a whole fully equal, if not surpass, 
 the average of past years." The Agricultural Gazette 
 says "the elegant forms of the Devon and the Down, the 
 most beautiful of breeds in cattle and sheep respectively, 
 never appeared either in equal perfection or in such 
 numbers." The first prize Devon ox under three years 
 old was bred by Prince Albert, and is said to be a re- 
 markably compact, well got up little thing, polished to 
 the very tips of the horns, which, by the way, are hardly 
 of a Devon charactar. The most elegant and beautiful 
 specimen of an animal in the yard, perhaps, was the first 
 prize Devon heifer,' by the Earl of Leicester, somewhat 
 lighter in color, beautifully fine in bone, horn and muz- 
 zle." The Hereford class were "hardly up in quality to 
 those of former years." The first prize was awarded to 
 Isaac Niblet, of Bristol, for a "well bred, remarkably 
 evenly fattened, ripe ox, very thick in the flesh all over 
 especially on the parts most valuable to the butcher." 
 The second prize was awarded to Prince Albert, for a
