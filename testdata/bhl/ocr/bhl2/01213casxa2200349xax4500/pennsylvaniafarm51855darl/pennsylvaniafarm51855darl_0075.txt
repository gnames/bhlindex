If your correspondent will address me at this place I

United States Agricultural Society. 

The Third Annual Meeting of the United States Agri- 
 cultural Society will be held at Washington, D. C, on 
 Wednesday, February 28, 1855. 

Business of importance will come before the meeting. 
 A new election of Officers is to be made, in which it is 
 desireable that every State and Territory should be rep- 
 resented. 

Lectures and interesting Discussions are expected on 
 subjects pertaining to objects of the Association, by dis- 
 tinguished scientific and practical Agriculturists. 

The various Agricultural Societies of the country are 
 requested to send delegates to this meeting; and all gen- 
 tlemen who are interested in the welfare of American 
 Agriculture, who would promote a more cordial spirit of 
 intercourse between the different sections of our land, 
 and who would elevate this most important pursuit to a 
 position of greater usefulness and honor, are also invited 
 to be present on this occasion.

Effectual Method for Destroying Rats. 

A correspondent of the Genesee Farmer gives the fol- 
 owing method for destroying rats. He says : 

"One day a stranger came to the house to buy some 
 barley, and hearing my father mention the difficulty he 
 had in freeing the house of these disagreeable tenants, 
 he said he could put him in the way of getting rid of 
 them with very little trouble. His directions were sim- 
 ply these : mix a quantity of arsenic with any sort of 
 grease, and plaster it pretty thick around all their holes. 
 The rats, he said, if they did not eat the poison, would 
 soil their coats in passing through the holes, and as, like 
 all furred animals, they are very cleanly, and cannot 
 endure any dirt upon their coats, to remove the offensive 
 matter they would lick their fur, and thus destroy them- 
 selves. This plan was immediately put in practice, and 
 in a month's time not a rat was to be seen about the 
 house or barn." 

Lime Water in Making Bread. 
 In bread-making, the vineous fermentation sometimes 
 passes into the acid, thus rendering the bread sour and 
 disagreeable. Leibig has lately performed a series of 
 experiments to improve the preparation of bread, from 
 which he comes to the conclusion, that the only effective 
 and innocuous means of improving the qualities of wheat 
 and rye bread, is lime water. In making dough he advi- 
 ces one pint of clear lime water to be used for every five 

pounds of flour. The lime water is first added to the 
 flour, after which a sufficient quantity of common water is 
 added to work the whole into good common dough — the 
 leaven being mixed with water can be prepared by stir- 
 ring some quick lime in a vessel containing pure cold 
 water, then allowing the sediment to settle. The clear 
 is then poured off and kept in bottles for use. No care 
 is required respecting the quantity of lime, to be stirred 
 in the water, as it will only take up a certain quantity 
 of lime, and no more. Those who use saleratus (bicar- 
 bonate of soda) in the raising of bread, are recommended 
 to cease its use, and employ pure baker's yeast and a 
 little lime water. Our bones are composed of the phos- 
 phate of lime, and those who use fine flour require for 
 their health a little more lime than is contained in the 
 food. Cream of tartar and carbonate of soda are infe- 
 rior to common yeast for making healthy bread. — Scien-

State Fair Premiums. 

A number of premiums awarded by the committees 
 at the late State Fair, remain in the hands of the treas- 
 urer of the Society. As the post office address of the 
 persons thus alluded to is unknown to the treasurer, 
 he has requested us to call attention to the subject, and 
 to request all whose premiums are yet unpaid, to inform 
 him how and where they may be sent.

Snowden Township Agricultural Society. 
 Our friend Joseph Miller, when sending us a club of 
 twenty subscribers adds. 

We have formed an Agricultural Society here. We 
 held our first Fair on the sixteenth of November last; it 
 was late in the season, but we had a very good exhibit- 
 ion. It was in some respects better than the Alleghany 
 County Fair. I am more in favor of township societies, 
 than either State or County societies. In township soci- 
 eties you can enlist the whole community, but in the 
 State or County societies you cannot.

 Wool Growers Look to Your Sheep. 
 Mr. Editor: — If wool growers would look more after 
 their sheep and see that proper bucks are kept in their 
 flocks, we would see more handsome and large sheep, 
 carrying fleeces of fine long and compact wool, in place 
 of the many long legged, misshaped sheep, carrying a 
 light, open and coarse fleece of unsaleable wool, which 
 will scarcely pay for producing it. But says one, when 
 have we proper bucks in our flocks? I will tell you 
 when you can be certain of it, and do not rest satisfied 
 until you have your arrangements made for the coming 
 fall; from now until you clip your sheep will be the last 
 good opportunity you will have for arranging them prop- 
 erly for this year. Begin by throwing out all the worst 
 formed sheep, from the flock you wish to breed from, 
 and then when you wash, you can throw out those hav- 
 ing coarse and uneven fleeces, and when you clip, you 
 can tell by the scales which are too light fleeced to retain. 
 Now make such marks on them that you will make no 
 mistakes, and next fall put a perfect buck with your flock
