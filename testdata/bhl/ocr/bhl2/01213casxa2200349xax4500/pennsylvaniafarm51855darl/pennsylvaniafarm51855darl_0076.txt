of ewes, and you will find that the offspring will more 
 than meet your most sanguine expectations. I have fol- 
 lowed this method for a number of years, and the man 
 that will follow the same method, will find that his sheep 
 will be much sought after by woolgrowers. Perhaps the 
 reader will ask what kind of sheep to breed from ? I 
 would answer Merino. For four lbs. of wool at sixty 
 cents will amount to two dollars and forty cents, which 
 is better than two at eighty cents; and fire lbs. at fifty 
 cents, which will amount to two dollars and fifty cents, 
 or six lbs. at forty cents, which will amount to two dol- 
 lars and forty cents, is better than one and a half lbs. at 
 ninety cents; and that ten lbs. at forty cents, is better 
 than four at eighty cents; yet I have exceeded any of the 
 above calculations. Yours respectfully, J. S. G.

 A Remedy. 

Some time since an inquiry was made through the 
 Farm Journal, how to prevent a horse from carrying out 
 his tongue. I will give the information, as it respects 
 one I have, when driven with a small or common bit she 
 will carry her tongue out, when I use a bit as large in 
 circumference as described in your letter or larger, she 
 does not do it. The bits above spoken of are Snafflee. 
 I perfer a snaffle bit of the size above named for common 
 use. I have used them nearly twenty years, and find 
 them the beet size for ease and comfort to the horse.

Presentation of Plate. 

The Harrisburg correspondent of the North American 
 in a recent letter says: s .. 

I witnessed yesterday evening a very interesting cere- 
 mony — the presentation to Mr. Robert C. Walker, of Al- 
 leghany county, Secretary, of the State Agricultural So- 
 ciety, of a beautiful silver tea set. The present is from 
 some of Mr. Walker's Philadelphia friends, who wit- 
 nessed with satisfaction, and were disposed thus to ac- 
 knowledge his labor at the late State exhibition in your 
 city. The set is of Philadelphia manufacture and ex- 
 exquisite finish. It consists of six pieces, all ornamen- 
 ted by figures illustrative of the objects for whose pro- 
 motion the Society was established. The presentation 
 speech was made by James Gowen, Esq., of Mt. Airy, 
 who discharged the duty in a very delicate and appro- 
 priate manner. Mr. Walker, fittingly replied, express- 
 ing his acknowledegments to the kind donors, and to Mr. 
 Gowen, for the handsome terms in which he had offered 
 this beautiful present. Mr. Walker, has been the Secre- 
 tary of the Society from its origin, iu the early part of 
 the year 1851, and has devoted all his energies to the dis- 
 ijharge of the duties of his office. He has labored zeal- 

ously, intelligently and successfully.- The Society ha- 
 grown from weakness to strength, a strength to which 
 Mr. W. has as materially contributed by his well direct - 
 ed efforts, as any connected with the management. Th<-* 
 testimonials refered to was thus justly offered, as it wa^ 
 to a worthy servant of the Society, and an efficient pro- 
 moter of its aims. 

Horace Greeley's Farm. 
 Our cousin of the Tribune, among the more Sensible 
 of his "isms," has a farm iu the neighborhood of Gothain 
 which has been leased by George E. Waring, Jr., author 
 of "Elements of Agriculture." His farm consists of 
 some sixty-four acres in all, twenty-four of which are 
 arable — the balance being rough pasture land. The 
 arable portion is a rich alluvial deposite, about half bi" 
 which contains some five miles of draining tile well laid 
 down. If our friend Waring can practice, as well as 
 he preaches in his "Elements," we may look for some; 
 valuable results from his fanning operations. AVe shall 
 be pleased if he will communicate his experience through 
 the Farm Journal. 

Dickey's Butter Worker. 
 An advertisement of this now almost indispensable 
 fixture in every well managed dairy will be found upon 
 the cover of the Journal. In confirmation of the ac- 
 companying testimonials of those who have tried thy 
 butter worker, we may add, that we had one of them 
 used in our own dairy during the past year, and speak 
 knowingly when we award it the credit of having al- 
 ready saved in labor alone its first cost, — to say nothing 
 of the superior quality of the butter over that worked 
 by hand. We have no hesitation in recommending this, 
 butter worker to dairymen, as being well worthy their 
 attention, and preferable to any thing of the kind tha*. 
 has come under our notice. 

Food for the MiUion. — Progressive Farmer. 
 A new and cheap agricultural paper has lately been 
 started in Philadelphia under the above title by our en - 
 terprising friend Col. Spangler, formerly connected with 
 the Farm Journal. It is offered at the low rate of 
 twenty-five cents per year, and consists of eight page;< 
 in the quarto form. The first number, just issued, is 
 illustrated with engravings and filled with excellent 
 original communications, as well as editorial and select- 
 ed matter, and also numerous advertisements. As thL< 
 is the first attempt in this country to bring so cheap a 
 paper before the farmers, we hope they will respond by 
 sending in subscriptions by the ten thousand to the en- 
 terprising Colonel, who has shown considerable moral 
 courage in so bold an undertaking. Five copies will be 
 sent for one dollar. His office is at the northeast corner 
 of Seventh and Market streets, Philadelphia. 

Farmer's Reading Room in Philadelphia. 
 Mr. Darlington : — The plan of establishing a Farmer's 
 Reading Room in some central location in Philadelphia 
 originated with Dr. Elwyn some few years since, and wi> 
 believe was then introduced by him to the notice of some of 
 our county societies, to be opened both day and evening, to 
 farmers visiting the city from all sections of the State, es- 
 pecially those who are in the regular habit of coming to tho
