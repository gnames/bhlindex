city with marketing, once, twice or three times a week. 

Although warmly advocated at that time by many of our 
 country friends, the project fell through. Latterly it has 
 been revived, and the suggestion made, that if the Farm 
 Journal now about being removed to the city, instead of 
 renting a room merely for its own accomodation, were to 
 procure one large enough, for the above purpose in addition, 
 and placo on the table of the reading room its agricultural 
 exchanges from all parts of the United States, for the use 
 of the farmer who might visit it ; it would be a great addi- 
 tional attraction, and prove highly useful and convenient. 
 It has been proposed, that the increased annual expense, 
 thus incurred, should be defrayed by a small contribution, 
 say $25. from each of the county societies around Philadel- 
 phia, whose members would more frequently avail them- 
 selves of the opportunity. Since the subject has been 
 revived, we have made inquiry, and have ascertained that 
 with such aid, a suitable large room can be obtained in a 
 central location within a square of Market St. We do not 
 know how far the Philadelphia Society would be disposed to 
 aid in this project, but we think it would be equally, if not 
 more advantageous to its members, than any others. Here 
 would be a room, warm and lighted, and open at all times 
 both day and evening to farmers and visitors. An arrange- 
 ment might also be made for the Philadelphia Society to 
 hold its monthly meetings there, and perhaps locate its libra- 
 ry. By making these in this way more accessible than at 
 present, its sphere of usefulness will be much extended. 

A Farmer's Heading Room in Philadelphia of the kind 
 proposed whether with or without connection with the office 
 of the Farm Journal, strikes us as being a most capital idea, 
 and beneficial to the Farming community in various respects. 
 We have no doubt, it would in time be made use of as 
 a kind of Farmers Exchange, in addition. Instead of 
 spending their evenings at the taverns, as market farmers 
 now are obliged to do, they would frequent the reading 
 room, not only to make use of the agricultural papers, but 
 also, as a kind of common central point, where they would 
 be sure of meeting their friends from various sections, in 
 the same occupation. Interchange of opinions, transaction 
 of business, and a genoral community of interest and feel- 
 ing would result, the good effects of which we think would 
 soon be felt. The Reading room, would soon be found to 
 be a place where the best information could be obtained re- 
 specting the state of the markets, the prospect of crops, the 
 introduction of new implements, improved breed of cattle, 
 and where they could be purchased, the price of land in 
 different sections, and all other matters interesting to the 
 farmer. A FARMER. 

We can inform a farmer that we have removed to Phila- 
 delphia, and occupy an office sufficiently largo to answer the 
 (aid he proposes, but we question if the sum he indicates 
 would meet tho additional expense. — Ed. 

Deep Cultivation. 
 J. Lacey Darlington, Editor of the Farm Journal :— 
 Having directed my attention somewhat to a deeper culti- 
 vation of the soil and the payable advantages arising there- 
 from, in the fall of 54 I purchased of P. Morris &, Co., a 
 Michigan Double Plow, and used it for plowing my oats 
 .stubbie, (first hauling out the manure which covered but a 
 part of the field,) and plowed it to the depth of twelve inches 
 ««• more. Covering to that depth the manure and a greater 
 part of the top soil, consequently it gave the field a different 
 .•appearance than it ever presented before. A subsoil of five 
 or six inches seemed but a poor prospect for a crop of wheat, 
 und the question was frequently asked ''What do you expect 
 to raise on that field?"' However I prepared the ground, 

(which was not more than half the labor than when plowed 
 the usual depth] and drilled in the wheat. It came up un- 
 commonly well and soon covered the ground. As to the 
 average yield per acre, I cannot say, not having threshed 
 all yet. But I am confident that on the manured part there 
 was at least 35 bushels per acre. To the remaining part of 
 the field, I applied 300 lbs. of Jourdan's Phosphate of Lime 
 per aere, which did not benefit the wheat much but had an 
 astonishing effect on the young timothy, forcing it to such 
 a growth as to materialy imjure tho wheat. The grain on 
 this part was perfect and weighed heavier than tho other, 
 but tho wheat did not shell out — hence less the yield. In 
 the spring of 54, I used the same plow for corn plowing the 
 same depth. I plowed about six acres with it, leaving one 
 acre in the middle of the field, for this I used a common 
 plow, prepared the ground and planted the corn. It came 
 up equally well all over the field, and no difference could be 
 seen for two or'threo weeks, when there was a marked diff- 
 erence to be seen in the coloring of the corn. That on the 
 subsoiled part was a pale yellow and looked rather sickly, 
 while tho other was a dark green and looked much more 
 like making a crop. This had a tendency to doubt on my 
 part as to its answering for corn. But as the season advan- 
 ced so did the corn, particularly that which grew on the 
 subsoiled part of the field, and in a few weeks there was 
 also a marked difference decidedly in favor of that which 
 was subsoiled ; and tho yield was one third more bushels per 
 acre and of a superior quality. I have also used it for vege- 
 tables and find the same beneficial results. In conclusion 1 
 will say that I have full faith in subsoiling, and believe the 
 Michigan Double Plow to be preferable to any other thnt 
 has come under my notice, and as such would recommend 
 it to others. Respectfully submitted,

Management of Poultry. 
 Mr. Editor: — I have no doubt that" many farmers would 
 find it greatly to their advantage if they would construct 
 comfortable and convenient quarters for their domestic fowls. 
 As I have tried a very good arrangement for some years and 
 find it to be fully successful in breeding and raising poul- 
 try and procuring a large quantity of eggs, at all seasons of 
 the year, therefore, by your permission I will describe my 
 fixtures, and give an account of the management of the fowls, 
 &c. My yard contains upwards of a quarter of an acre, 
 and is enclosed with a picket fence four feet' high, and is 
 divided nearly equally into, four yards by a lath fence. 
 Each of these yards contains a house,- — the first is situated 
 in the southeast of the main yard, which is at the entrance, 
 and is two stories in height, two rooms one above the other, 
 the first room is seven by seven feet, and eight feet in height, 
 plastered, with cement floor, two glass windows two by three 
 feet facing the east and west, wooden door in the south ga- 
 ble end, has three inch strips laid on two by three's ranging 
 from tho floor to the ceiling two feet apart, a few nests on 
 one side; this room is intended more particularly for a sleep- 
 ing and living department; the upper room has the same di- 
 mensions except the height which is but five feet, overshoot 
 roof with ornamental work around; double glass door cover- 
 ing nearly the whole south gable. This room is intended 
 for a sotting room and contains thirty nests for that purpose. 
 Tho next house is situated in the north part of the main 
 yard, and is similar to the first mentioned, except its having 
 double glass doors covering nearly the whole south gable. 
 This house is intended for a living room, though they both 
 answer admirably, for the hens to lay in. The other two
