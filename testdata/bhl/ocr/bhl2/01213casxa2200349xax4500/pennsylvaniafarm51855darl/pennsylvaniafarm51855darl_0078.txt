houses are situated in the north western and south western 
 eorners of the yard and face the east, glass fronts and laying 
 room attached. The hens pass out of these houses through 
 a small hole with a slide door, deposit their eggs quietly, 
 leave their nest, take a range around about their enclosure, 
 partake of a variety of food which is prepared and set before 
 them at all times. The food consists of corn, oats, buck- 
 wheat, mush, boiled potatoes, occasionly pounded oyster 
 shells, old plaster, and some meat which is absolutely neces- 
 sary. In the early part of the fall the" fowls are selected and 
 placed in the last named houses for fall and winter laying, 
 provided as above. In the course of a very few weeks, they 
 all commence laying and continue for a long time. Should 
 they have a tendency to set, they are removed to the first 
 named houses and yards and are kept there until cured, 
 which is in two weeks or ten days; they are then returned to 
 where taken from and soon resume laying again. In this 
 routine they are kept until the middle of February and fore 
 part of spring, which time we select our eggs for hatching. 
 The hens become very much .inclined to set after laying so 
 very long, and stick closely to their laying rooms. At night 
 we remove them to their sleeping room, place them on nests 
 containing eggs, provide them with feed and water constant- 
 ly, never leaving them out until the eggs are hatched. Un- 
 der this treatment we invariably get a large number of fine 
 large, plump, healthy chickens, seldom losing more than one 
 out of twenty-five until maturity. When the chicks are 
 hatched the hen and chicks are put into a packing box with 
 lath nailed on the one side, wide enough for the chicks to 
 pass through. Occasionally the old bird is allowed to range 
 with them. The chicks are fed on Indian meal moistened 
 with a little water, and fresh water which is absolutely ne- 
 cessary, as water docs not cause sickness as soni-» persons sup- 
 pose; and in fact, we find that it is bad management that 
 principally creates sickness. The houses and fences are 
 white-washed three or four times a year and kept cleanly. 
 As to profit wo find them to be pretty nearly all clear gain 
 on a farm. I will simply add that the fowls, which my yard 
 is stocked with, were bred from a cock and two hens which 
 came in the ill fated steamer City of Glasgow, March twen- 
 ty-second, 1853, and are Chochin China, cinamon and buff 
 variety; they had a rough voyage, causing one of the hens 
 to become very sick, consequently I lost all of her eggs the 
 first season. The other hen and cock were in fine health; 
 she produced me some fifty fine strong well formed fowls of 
 a uniform color the first spring. I tried others which I pur- 
 chased from several gentleman in this country, but they 
 would not give general satisfaction; consequently I abandon- 
 ed them. I find my own importation give full satisfacton, 
 particularly abroad, as I have sent a considerable number 
 to gentlemen in different States. I am aware there is a 
 prejudice with many persons against this breed of fowls, but 
 if they should once procure the true breed I think it would 
 be speedily removed, as they posess highly superior qualities 
 being neither large consumers, ill formed, ungainly or 
 coarscd fleshed, but precisely the reverse, being in a high 
 degree richly flavored, juicy, fine grained, medium bone for 
 so largo a fowl, and easily fattened. It would be advisable, 
 however that farmers bo careful whom they purchase fowls 
 from to stock their farms with, as there are fowls offered for 
 sale as pure shanghais, which have actually bred fowls with 
 crests upon their heads. I should observe that it is not ne- 
 cessary for so large an arrangement need be constructed, as 
 one fourth of my place would bo ample to breed some two 
 hundred head. Respectfully, G. E -

Will Ashes Dissolve Bones? 

Owing to the indisposition of farmers generally to use sul- 
 phuric acid in reducing bones to pulp or powder, many 
 persons knowing the value of the bones cast away from the 
 kitchen, of every farm house as worthless, have racked their 
 brains to discover soino moans of turning them into account- 
 Some have had them broken and ground like plaster, which 
 when mixed with the soil becomes a valuable and lasting 
 manure, but not very speedy in its operation. , It has been 
 known to many that bones heaped together and covered with 
 some moist substance would heat and soften, and could thus 
 be prepared for the field; but the best account we have seen 
 is the following, given in a recent number of the Country 
 Gentleman. 

If the question be asked, will ashes dissolvo bones? the 
 answer is, no, not in the proper sense of that term, not as 
 water dissolve sugar or salt. But if it be asked whether 
 ashes will reduce bones to a condition in which they will 
 be speedily available to plants, the answer is, yes. The 
 Hon. Philip Pusey, ascertained several years ago, and, after 
 carefully experimenting upon the discovery three or four 
 years, published in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural 
 Society, that bones, if placed in a pile and coverod over with 
 wood ashes, of fossil coal, leached ashes, common soil, or 
 sand even, will heat and crumble to powder. He showed, as 
 the result of careful experiments, several times repeated, that 
 bones treated in this way become a valuable manure; and 
 upon the strength of his own experience, he recommended 
 this course to English farmers. 

A friend of ours, in whom we have entire confidence, in- 
 forms us that seven years ago ho fell into the practice of re- 
 ducing bones by means of ashes, by a sort or" a fortunate 
 blunder. Being at the head of a very large family, in which 
 fresh meat was largely consumed, he found that his Irish cook 
 was in the habit of throwing all the bones out of the back- 
 window. This drew sn.ch a bevy of dogs, with voices, bass, 
 tenor and treble, about the house, that it was impossible to 
 sleep quietly. In order to withdraw temptation from the 
 dogs, and to preserve the bones for the use of his land, to be 
 prepared in some way then unknown, he ordered the bones 
 to be carried and put into an old sugar hogshead, placed 
 in a grove at a little distance from the house, and the ashes 
 from the kitchen to be thrown on them, the hogshead to be 
 uncovered that the rain might fall into it. Whenever an of- 
 fensive smell arose from the bones, which was only in dry- 
 weather he found that a little water thrown on prevented it. 
 As soon as the first hogshead was full, another was placed by 
 it and filled, and then another. His intention was to use the 
 ashes and bones on Indian corn, supposing that by the next 
 spring the bones would be somewhat softened, so much so 
 that they might be pounded to pieces with a sledge hammer 
 on a flat stone. The hammer and the stone were actually 
 procured for the purpose. But no bones were found, except 
 near the top of the hogshead last filled. Instead of the 
 bones, were Jbund soft saponaceous masses, retaining the 
 form and size of the original bones, but none of their hard- 
 ness. The} 7 were easily cut with a shovel and mixed with 
 the ashes; and when so mixed and applied to corn at the rate 
 of a half pint to the hill, they proved an excellent manure for 
 corn.

We have on hand, but too late for present number, the 
 pedigrees in full of the superior Devon Bull, and three 
 cows lately purchased by Mr. Curwen for his farm in 
 Montgomery County, Pa. 

We shall publish them in our next.
