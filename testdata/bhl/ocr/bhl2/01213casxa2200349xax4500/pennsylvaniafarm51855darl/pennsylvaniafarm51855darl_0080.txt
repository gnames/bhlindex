Meeting of the Philadelphia Society for Promoting 
 Agriculture. 

Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture, stated 
 meeting at room, Masonic Hall, South Third street, 
 Wednesday morning, February 7, 1855. 

Mr. Landreth, President, in the chair. Minutes of 
 preceding meeting read and approved. Messrs. Paschal] 
 Morris and Andrew M. Spangler were elected life mem- 
 bers. One proposition for life membership and two for 
 resident contributing membership were received. 

The Secretary reported having distributed copies of 
 the published minutes of the Society from 1785 to 1810 
 to a number of kindred Societies. Letters from Mr. H. 
 Meigs, Secretary of New York Farmers' Club, and from 
 Mr. J. W. Degreau, Secretary of the Brooklyn Horticul- 
 tural Society, were read, returning thanks for copies. 
 A pamphlet containing the address of Mr. Degreau be- 
 fore his Society was received. 

Dr. Kennedy, in behalf of the Committee on Agricul- 
 tural Statistics of Pennsylvania, reported that the Com- 
 mittee had learned since their appointment that the 
 State Society was engaged in a similar object, and in 
 furtherance of it had already sent printed questions to 
 nearly all the county societies in the State. To some of 
 these, replies had been received and been printed in the 
 volume of the proceedings of the State Society, publish- 
 ed by authority of the last Legislature. It was true 
 that no such questions had ever reached this Society, 
 nor was any account of the Philadelphia Society con- 
 tained in the volume aforesaid ; nevertheless the general 
 subject of State statistics more properly belonged to the 
 State Society. That body had already commenced the 
 good work of collecting definite information, and as ac- 
 tion on our part might be regarded as interfering with 
 theirs, he (Dr. K.) moved that the Committee be dis- 
 charged, which was so ordered. 

Dr. A. L. Elwyn feared that the State, Society woxild 
 not succeed this year in obtaining the publication of its 
 proceedings by Legislative enactment. 

IT. Ingersoll proposed to amend 19th By-Laws, so as 
 to render the President eligible for more than two terms. 

Dr. Kennedy moved that the Executive Committee be 
 requested to report at next meeting on the expediency of 
 the Society's holding an exhibition next autumn. 

Voted, on motion of Dr. Kennedy, that delegates be 
 now elected to represent this Society at the next session 
 of the United States Agricultural Society, to be held in 
 Washington on 28th inst. 

Voted, on motion of A. S. Roberts, that the delega- 
 tion be appointed by the chair, and that they have pow- 
 er to fill vacancies ; whereupon the following gentlemen 
 were appointed : A. L. Kennedy, A. T. Newbold, A. S. 
 Roberts, H. Ingersoll, J. McGowan, C. W. Sharpless, A. 
 Clement, S. Williams, J. S. Haines, S. C. Willits, G. 
 Blight, C. W. Harrison, Gen. R. Patterson, J. Pearson, 
 and S. C. Ford. 

Dr. Elwyn laid before the Society samples of dust from 
 the flues at the foundry of Mr. Chas. S. Smith. This dust 
 collected in large quantities both from the bituminous 
 and anthracite coal fires. It has been spread on land, 
 and was believed to produce about one-half the fertili- 
 sing effect of guano. Further experiments were neces- 

sary before the exact value could be determined. These 
 he hoped members of the Society would make. For 
 such a purpose they would cheerfully be furnished with 
 a supply on applying at Mr. Smith's iron works. The 
 researches of chemists and the introduction of guano 
 had done much towards directing the attention of far- 
 mers and others to concentrated manures, and the em- 
 ployment of waste products. The samples before the 
 Society were evidences in point. Further investigation 
 would reveal many substances now mere refuse, which 
 either alone or in mixture would prove rich boons to the 
 agriculturist. Dr. E. had learned that during last sea- 
 son, guano had not proved equally beneficial to the land 
 of Chester county on which it had been used ; when 
 mixed with lime the effect had been much more mani- 
 fest. 

Mr. A. M. Spangler had had occasion to observe the 
 comparative yield of land manured with guano and with 
 superphosphate of lime, and in nearly all cases had the 
 latter proved more advantageous, and this not only on 
 wheat but on grass. Moreover grass and hay from land 
 thus manured were much better relished by cattle. 
 This fact was beginning to be well understood by far- 
 mers. He had recently been offered a lot of hay from 
 Delaware county at the full market price, and one of the 
 recommendations urged by the vendor was that it had 
 been cut from "boned" land. Such hay had been said 
 to support cattle better. He would ask for Mr. Cle- 
 ment's opinion on this point. 

Mr. A. Clement had observed no proof that such hay 
 was more nutritious. He knew that cattle were fond of 
 it, and would select it in preference to all other. 

Mr. S. C. Willits preferred guano, but having been 
 unable a few years since to find any in this market, he 
 had purchased some superphosphate of lime, and at the 
 same time a quantity of a material called "Fertilizer." 
 He had spread 47i bushels of each on equal parts of the 
 same field, leaving a portion unmanured, and from that 
 day to this he had been unable to discover any appre- 
 ciable difference in the crops. He, of course, knew 
 nothing of the purity of the articles which he had pur- 
 chased, nor could any farmer know until there was a 
 State Chemist appointed, whose duty it should be to in- 
 form us of the nature of our soils, and guard against 
 fraud in concentrated manures. Guano had been placed 
 on a field adjoining the above, and its effects three years 
 after wheat, were markedly favorable, yielding about 1Â£ 
 tons timothy to the acre. A portion of his farm of 135 
 acres had formerly belonged to Mr. Walker, once a well 
 known "book farmer" of this county, who before the 
 days of bone dust had heavily "boned" the land, put- 
 ting on the bones, for the want of suitable mills, in 
 large pieces, many of which now remained undecom- 
 posed. 

Dr. Elwyn inquired what redress the farmer had in 
 case advertised manure failed to come up to the assu- 
 rances of the vendor ? Were such manures like quack 
 medicines, sold for cash, the buyer losing both time and 
 money? He had recently seen a decision of an English 
 court on the subject, which seemed to him peculiarly 
 just, and one which he hoped would be sustained in this 
 country. A farmer had bought on credit a quantity of 
 concentrated manure, warranted to produce a certain
