Corn Fodder for Cows and Subsoiling. 
 Our friend George Walker, of Susquehanna county, one 
 of the best farmers of northern Pennsylvania, writes us 
 as follows respecting the advantages of feeding cut corn 
 fodder to his cows. 

It agrees with other experiments tried elsewhere, 
 and where the profitable results are so obvious, and 
 within the reach of all, it is only surprising that so 
 many farmers should continue in the wasteful habit of 
 feeding their fodder in sheaves, and in the open yard, 
 where not less than one half is actually lost. Stock will 
 not masticate much but the leaves and tops, unless it is 
 cut and crushed; that the stalks contain valuable nutri- 
 ment has been fully settled, and the practice of letting 
 them be trodden under foot for manure, is no more ra- 
 tional than to throw out hay for manure, without first 
 yielding its nutriment in passing through the body of 
 the animal. The letter says: 

"Last winter I kept our cows and oxen on corn fod- 
 der, which we cut with a corn stalk cutter I procured of 

Wheeler, Mellich & Co., Albany, whereby we saved at 
 least twenty tons of hay, in consequence of which we 
 are enabled to keep this winter fifty-six head of horned 
 cattle and five horses, being twice the number we were 
 able to keep under the old and wasteful mode of feeding 
 corn stalks without first being cut with a good machine. 
 The subsoil plow I purchased of P. Morris & Co., in 
 Philadelphia, last spring, answers a better purpose than 
 I had anticipated. The use of it in our land for so 1 
 will prove invaluable, draining off the surplus water in % 
 wet season, and a dry one, enabling the roots an oppor 'Â» 
 tunity to penetrate into the moist pulverized earth. 
 On two acres subsoiled and sowed with corn broadcast, 
 at the rate of three bushels to the acre we raised five 
 tons to the acre of very superior fodder, although last 
 season was the dryest ever known in this section of 
 country. Judging by comparison, without the subsoil 
 plow, we would not have raised more than three tons to 
 the acre, if so much." 

Peeling the Basket Willow. 

A correspondent of the New England Farmer says : 

I recently witnessed the trial of a machine invented 
 by George J. Colby, of Jonesville, Vt., for peeling the 
 basket willow, which is destined to become of great im- 
 portance in this country. It does the work in the most 
 perfect manner, is operated by one horse-power, and 
 with two men, will peel one ton per day. 

It has been fully proved, within a few years, that 
 the European Osier will thrive as well in this as in the 
 old country, and those cultivated here are Bought after 
 by the manufacturer in preference to the imported. 
 There are annually imported to the United States ovtr 
 Jive million dollars worth, besides the manufactured arti- 
 cle, which amount is very large, all of which might be 
 cultivated in this country to great advantage. 

The only objection to the cultivation of the willow in 
 this country, is the scarcity of labor required to peel it 
 for market, as it must be done in the spring, during the 
 short period that the bark will strip, and in many local- 
 ities the required labor cannot be had. The estimated 
 cost for peeling by hand is about $40 per ton. That ob- 
 jection is now removed by the invention of a machine for 
 the purpose. I doubt if there is any business that will 
 yield the husbandman as large a profit as the cultivation 
 of the willow, by those who have suitable soils. It will 
 thrive well on most of our soils, or any that are rich and 
 moist, or what is termed good grass land ; but that is 
 best adapted which is natural to our native -willow, and 
 will yield an average of two tons per acre. The present 
 price for the willow is G cents per pound, with an in- 
 creasing demand, and much larger than the supply. 

The best willow for cultivation of which I am acquain- 
 ted is the Salix viminalis ; it grows in this locality from 
 eight to ten feet high, is very smooth, free from knots, 
 and never branches. There are other varieties that ar 
 valuable for hedges, or live fences, which will yield ai 
 annual profit for Osiers. 

Cure for Bots in Horses. 
 J. S. Goff, of Bellefontaine, O., writes, "I herewith 
 send you a recipe for the cure of Bots in horses. It is a 
 very simple remedy, and I have never known it to fail,
