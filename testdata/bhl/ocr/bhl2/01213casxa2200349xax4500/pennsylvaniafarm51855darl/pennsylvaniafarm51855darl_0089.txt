if applied in time. With uio it has never failed. Take 
 one pint of new milk or more if you choose ; add to it 
 enough sugar or molasses to make it quite sweet — add 
 to this from two to three table-spoonsfull of hair, taken 
 either from the tail or mane of the horse, cut as fine as 
 you can clip it with scissors or shears; stir the cut hair 
 into the sweetened milk and drench the beast. Give him

The Value of Apples. 
 In some of the Eastern States, apples are extensively 
 used for feeding and fattening stock in winter; and while 
 we are setting out orchards in the west, it is worthy of 
 consideration whether we may not devote a portion of 
 our farms to this express purpose, independent of any 
 idea of selling or eating the fruit ourselves. And this 
 question acquires a greater importance since we have 
 been deprived of potatoes, and are unable to find any 
 crop, which will supply the deficiency. What every 
 farmer needs during winter is some root or fruit, con- 
 taining a large amount of water or juice, with positive 
 nutritive qualties, afforded at a low price. Apples, when 
 once planted, cost nothing but the gathering and the in- 
 terest. They keep well, with slight trouble, during win- 
 ter ; properly planted, they are a very certain crop ; the 
 only thing to be decided, therefore, is, are they suffi- 
 ciently nutritive to render them worth growing for the 
 fattening of stock? Dr. Salisbury, of Albany, N. Y., has 
 studied them with this very point in view; and we ab- 
 stract the following from his report which we recom- 
 mend to the careful study of every farmer:

By comparing the composition of the apple with that 
 of the potatoe it will be noticed. 1. That the former 

contains 3 per cent, mere of water than the latter. 2, 
 That the dextrine and sugar in the apple take the place 
 of the starch, dextrine and sugar in the potato. The 
 above principles are the main bodies in the apple and 
 potato which go to form fat. In the aggregate amount 
 of fat-producing products, the apple and potato do not 
 materially differ. It would be natural, however, to in- 
 fer that 50 lbs. of dextrine and sugar would, if taken 
 into the system, be more likely to make a greater quan- 
 tity of fat in a given time, or at least to make the same 
 amount in a shorter period, than an equal weight of 
 starch, for this reason, that the two former bodies, al- 
 though nearly the same in composition with the latter, 
 yet are physically further advanced in organization, and 
 hence, probably, approximate nearer the constitution of 
 fat. If this view be taken, then the apple may be re- 
 garded equally, if not more rich in fat-producing pro- 
 ducts than the potato. 3. The apple is richer in nitroge- 
 nous compounds than the potato. In albumen the apple 
 is richer than the potato, while in casein the reverse is 
 the case. The aggregate amount of albumen, casein 
 and gluten, in good varieties of the apple, is more than 
 double that of the same bodies in the potato ; hence the 
 apple may be regarded as richest in those substances 
 which form muscle, brain, nerve, &c, and the body. 
 The difference between sweet and sour apples appears to 
 be, that in the first the fat-producing, and in the other 
 muscle-forming compounds abound. A sweet apple is 
 superior for a fattening or milking animal; the sour apple 
 for one that is working. But, practically, the difference 
 is greater than the analysis would show; the sweet apple 
 not only contains a larger amount of unformed fat, but 
 the acid of the sour apple tends to destroy or prevent the 
 deposit of fat in an animal ; and as is well known, sour 
 apples will dry up a milch cow, while sweet ones add to 
 the milk. The money value of apples, compared with 
 potatoes, may be stated somewhat as follows: for fatten- 
 ing, 1000 lbs. of sweet apples are worth about 1050 lbs. 
 of potatoes; for feeding to growing or working stock, 
 1000 lbs. of good sour apples are equivalent to 2000 lbs. 
 of potatoes, and in practice should produce the same 
 effect. So that, in the first case, a farmer would only 
 be justified in paying 25 cents a bushel for apples; in 
 the latter, he might pay 50 cents without losing. (By 
 the word "sour" we mean any that are not positively 
 "sweet.") 

According to Dr. Salisbury's analysis no two varieties 
 are exactly alike in composition or water, the proportions 
 constantly differing. Thus, in six kinds, he found the 
 water to eary from 79 to 8G per cent; or in other woi-ds, 
 a person buying 100 lbs. of each, got 7 lbs. more pure 
 water in one lot than another; and, consequently lost to 
 that extent. It were an interesting investigation which 
 are actually the cheapest — the small and hard, or the 
 overgrown and soft apples. We suspect that there is as 
 much nourishment in three-quarters of a bushel of 
 "Rhode Island Greenings" as in a whole bushel of 
 "Monstrous Pippins." 

In conclusion, we call upon such western farmers as 
 expect to remain on their farms, to set out apples. Se- 
 lect your orchard carefully for your own use and for sale; 
 and then plant all over your farm, in fence corners and 
 every vacant spot, good sweet apples; and even put them
