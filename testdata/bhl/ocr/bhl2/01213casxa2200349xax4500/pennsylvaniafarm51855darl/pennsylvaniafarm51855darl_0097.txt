The Lolium Perenne has a fibrous root with culm, 
 normally about twenty inches high, spikelets beardless, 
 and longer than the glumes. There are at least seven 
 distinct varieties of rye grass, which have received 
 botanical designations, but their peculiar characters 
 possess more interest for the botanist than farmer, such 
 as L. P. tenue found in dry impoverished land, L. P. 
 huinile only six or seven inches high, L. P. ramosum or 
 branchy, L. P. paniculatum, multiflorum, monstrosum, 
 viviparum, &c. There are also several kinds named af- 
 ter the persons who discovered and brought them into 
 notice, varying somewhat in their characters and advan- 
 tages for particular localities, among these are Whit- 
 worth's rye grass, introduced in 1823. He had sixty 
 varieties growing for experiment Also Pacy's rye 
 grass, which Sinclair regarded as the best of all, having 
 numerous and large root-leaves, long cauline leaves, with 
 shorter spikelets and fewer seeds than most others, and 
 well adapted for pleasure grounds and permanent pas- 
 tures. Then there is also Russell's rye grass, Stick- 
 ney's, and several others. 

The Italian rye grass, Lolium Italicum, is regarded by 
 some as a wide variety, and by others as a separate spe- 
 cies of the common rye grass. It always has an awn or 
 beard on its lower paleae. English authorities say, "It 
 has eminent adaptation to the production of only one 
 year of grass, yet when cut down before flowering is of- 
 ten of several years duration. It is better being grown 
 alone than in mixture with clover, lucerne or other 
 herbage plants, growing so rapidly as to be liable to 
 choke them." 

Our own impression is, the grass we have been speak- 
 ing of, as generally grown in the United States under 
 the name of rye grass, is the Lolium Perenne, or 
 English perennial rye grass, which grows wild in the 
 grass lands of Great Britain, and not the Italian rye 
 grass, Lolium Italicum, which it is often called. The 
 latter having the striking peculiarity of being always 
 awned, would give a ready means of identification. 

Any additional information about rye grass from eith- 
 er our scientific or practical friends, will be received 
 with pleasure. 

The Pennsylvania Farm Journal. 
 "We have been in the habit of speaking of this paper 
 as one of the best in the country, but for some time past 
 it seems to have become the special champion of certain 
 gentlemen in whom we certainly have little confidence. 
 We half suspect that the Journal has connected itself with 
 some agricultural warehouse, and that this is the cause 
 of its change of tone and character. We shall be glad 
 to have these suspicions removed." 

We clip the above from the "Country Gentleman" of 
 January 18th, and should have noticed it last month 
 had not the paper failed to reach us in regular course 
 of mail. 

We are not aware of having "recently become the spe- 
 cial champion of certain gentlemen" or even the champion 
 of any gentlemen whatever; and as for becoming connec- 
 ted with some agricultural warehouse, we can inform our 
 friend Tucker that the very reverse is the case. Mr. 
 Darlington, the editor, and one of the two proprietors of 
 the Farm Journal, was formely a member of the firm 
 of Paschall Morris & Co., who, as is well known, had 

a large agricultural warehouse in this city, and another 
 in West Chester. The former is still owned by the firm 
 of Paschall Morris & Co., the latter by D. W. Entriken 
 — Mr. Darlington having no interest in either. 

We can assure our friend of the Country Gentleman 
 that neither mercenary expectations or personal spleen 
 will be permitted to control the course of the Farm Jour 
 nal. Our desire is to impart reliable information on 
 subjects of practical interest to the farmers of this and 
 adjoining States, regardless alike of the effect su:h in- 
 formation may have upon the interest of any manufac- 
 turer or vendor of any article in the market- 

A Pleasing Compliment. 
 In our last number we copied from the Harrif burg 
 correspondence of the North American, a brief notice of 
 the presentation of plate to Robert C. Walker, Esq., 
 Secretary of the Pennsylvania State Agricultural So- 
 ciety. Since then a friend and correspondent has kindly 
 furnished us with the following abstract of the proceed- 
 ings: 

Our correspondent says: "The presentation took place 
 at Harrisburg on the evening of the 15th ult., in the 
 large drawing room of Mrs. Espy's boarding house. 
 The company present on the occasion was highly re- 
 spectable, and embraced the names of several distin- 
 guished characters, among whom were the Rev. H. H. 
 Bean, Rector of the Episcopal Church, Hon. Wm. M. 
 Hiester, Speaker of the Senate, Senators Eli K. Pri^e 
 and N. B. Browne from Philadelphia, Senators Darsie 
 from Allegheny, and Flenniken from Green, and some 
 members of the House of Representative, with citizens 
 of Harrisburg, including a few members of the presv. 
 and last not least, a goodly array of ladies, whose pres- 
 ence and sparkling eyes gave additional brilliancy to thj 
 highly polished silver tea set ; for what "tea things,' 
 however artistically burnished, but would appear dull 
 and leaden without they reflected the genial light of the 
 presiding deities of the tea table. After the presenta- 
 tion the company partook of a cold collation, a blessing 
 being first invoked by the Rev. Mr. Bean. The refresh- 
 ments were prepared on short notice by Mrs, Espy, and 
 were both choice and appropriate, and in good taste, like 
 every thing that Mrs. Espy does. The evening passed 
 off delightfully, indeed profitably, and will be long re- 
 membered by every one who like myself had the pleasure 
 of sharing in its rational enjoyments." 

Remarks of Mr. James Gowejt. — Mr.. Walker: — 
 Since my arrival in Harrisburg, I have received a letter 
 from a gentleman in Philadelphia, who, at the instance of 
 several of your agricultural friends in that city, request? 
 me to present to you a Silver Tea Set, the same now before 
 me, which it appears has been sent hither for that purpose. 

I could wish, sir, that the contributors to this beautiful 
 testimonial, had deputed some one more competent than 
 myself, to represent them on the occasion. Yet, notwith- 
 standing the suddenness of the call made upon me, and un- 
 prepared as I am to acquit myself as I could desire, the 
 pleasuro I feel in being the medium between you and them 
 in a matter so interesting to me, renders the task a pleasing 
 duty — because I am so sensible of the merits of the recipi- 
 ent, and the pure and disinterested motives of the donors. 

This testimonial was not elicited through political parti- 
 zanship, nor is it offered by those, who to-day would applaud
