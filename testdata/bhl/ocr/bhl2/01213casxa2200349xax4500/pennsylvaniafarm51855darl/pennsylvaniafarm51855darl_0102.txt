DOUBLE MICHIGAN PLOW. 

In our January number, we wrote an article on deep 
 plowing, and recommending the double Michigan plow. 
 Above we give an engraving which has recently been 
 taken, and gives a very good idea of it to those not 
 acquainted with its peculiar construction. Since we 
 wrote the former article, we have heard additional and 
 very satisfactory accounts of its use, and there has been 
 also some communications respecting it in the Farm 
 Journal from our correspondents. The mould board is 
 much the shape of the old Prouty centre draught mould 
 board, now so widely known for its economy in draft, 
 considering the amount of work done. The Michigan 
 plow is strongly built. The price is $15 50.

Wire Web Fencing. 

We learn that John Nesmith, Esq., a well known 
 manufacturer of Lowell, Mass., has recently invented 
 and patented a machine for manufacturing Wire Web 
 Fencing, and that considerable quantities of it have been 
 successfully tried for enclosing highways, railroads, 
 canals, fields, gardens, cemeteries, heneries, for grape 
 and rose trellises, for ornamental garden work, etc. It 
 is varnished (black) with asphaltum varnish, or coated 
 with coal tar, painted, japanned, or galvanized, to 
 beautify and preserve it. It is rolled up in portable 
 rolls, from twenty to forty rods in length, and any ordi- 
 nary farmer can set it up for himself. No rails are 
 used ; but the netting is fastened to parts of wood, iron, 
 or stone, set from ten to fifteen feet apart, with hooks, 
 wire, nails, or staples. The only skill required in set- 
 ting it up is to keep it straight, and moderately tight. 
 This is done by hand. 

We have observed that many of the agricultural pa- 
 pers speak highly of this fence. The Plough, Loom $ 
 Anvil hails it as "a blessing to all the farmers of the 
 country." The New England Farmer says : 

"When properly set, it is strong enough to "hold" an 
 ox, and too close to be penetrated by a chicken If 
 varnished, painted or tarred, once in five or six years, it 
 is calculated to last a century or more. It offers so lit- 
 tle resistance^ wind and tide, that no gale can blow it 

down, or flood wash it away. If fastened to posts, set 
 upon feet instead of being set in the ground, this fence 
 may be laid flat on the land, or entirely removed on the 
 approach of the flood-season in districts subject to floods, 
 and set up again as good as ever, when the flood has 
 subsided. It excludes none of the rays of the sun; it har- 
 bors no weeds, or vermin ; it covers none of the soil, like 
 hedges and walls, and the peculiar mode of its texture en-
