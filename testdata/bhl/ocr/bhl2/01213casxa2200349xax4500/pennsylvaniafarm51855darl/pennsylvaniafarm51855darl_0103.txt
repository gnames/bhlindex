ternate expansion and contraction to which all metallic 
 substances are subjected by the changes of temperature 
 incident to the atmosphere. All who have examined or 
 tried it, attest that it possesses in the highest degree, 
 those seven cardinal qualities in a perfect fence or trel- 
 lis-work — sti'ength, closeness, beauty, lightness, portabil- 
 ity, cheapness and durability." 

We are happy to present some cuts to illustrate sev- 
 eral kinds of this fence. 

Figure 1 represents the best field fence of the Lowell 
 Vire Fence Company — cheap, strong, close, light, ele- 
 gant and durable ; 4 feet high ; lateral (or straight) 
 wires of No. 10 wire; body of No. 12 wire; price $1.10, 
 (or if the body be of No. 15 wire, 75 cents,) per lineal 
 rod. 

FIGURE 2. 

Figure 2 represents a still cheaper mode of wire fence 
 for fields, &c; being of the same height, with wire and 
 mesh of the same size, but without the wire rails in the 
 body of the fence. Price 95 cents per rod — some of 
 this kind, of No. 15 body wire, is only 60 cents per 
 rod. 

Figure 3 represents the wire, sheep, poultry, garden 
 or cemetery fence, with mesh of 3 inches— some 16 in- 
 ches, some 3 feet, and some 4 feet high ; outside wires 
 of No. 12 wire ; inside wires of No. 15 wire. That 4 
 feet, is $1.50 per rod ; that 3, is $1.12J ; and that 16 
 inches, 65 cents. These modes of fence may be made 
 lighter or heavier, as purchasers desire.

 States Agricultural Society, who has used some of this 
 fence, in a letter to Charles Crowley, Esq., says : 

"I have recently examined some of the netting of the 
 Lowell Wire Fence Company for fences, trellises, etc. 
 From my own experience, and that of others, I cannot 
 doubt that it is perfectly practicable as a fence for fields 
 and gardens, or that it is well adapted to all uses where 
 a strong, close, elegant, economical and durable fence is 
 required. Where stone is not abundant, or where lum- 
 ber is expensive, as in many of our States, I should 
 deem it the most practicable fence that could be pro- 
 cured. If our railroads are hereafter to be enclosed, as 
 safety and economy demand — they can scarcely be 
 fenced cheaper or better than by this mode of fence. 
 The stouter kinds of this netting are of such strength, 
 that cattle could not easily penetrate or pass it ; while 
 the closeness of the lighter kinds renders them admira- 
 bly available for garden uses, heneries, and poultry 
 fences. Fencing like this has for some years been ex- 
 tensively used in Great Britain ; and, since it can now 
 be made at a much less cost by machinery, it would 
 seem to be equally adaptative to the United States. I 
 know of no fencing so good as this, that can be procured 

figure 4. 
 for $1.50 per rod, the highest price asked for the most 
 costly kinds of this netting ; and this is, probably, the 
 only fencing of equal merit that can be bought for $1.50 
 per rod
