THE FARM JOURNAL. 

Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. 

The stated meeting of the Society occurred on the 20th ult., 
 in Concert Hall, and gave general satisfaction. For the fu- 
 ture all the monthly meetings will be held in this Saloon. 
 The President in the chair. The display was very good — 
 collections from four green houses were shown. In Mr. 
 Buist's there were several new and interesting plants — the 
 Dendrobium Wallichianum, Azeleae Iveryana and Geranium 
 Snow Ball, a beautiful Rogiera Thirsijlora, and an exquisite 
 seedling Camellia, a white tinted with rose. In Mr. Fahne- 
 stock's were a very graceful Acacia Probescens, Camellias, 
 and other choice plants. In Mr. Tucker's, several species 
 of beautifully trained Kennedyas, Azalea Pallida, [new,) 
 and a dozen handsome Cinerarias. Mr. Raabe bought a 
 seedling white Azalea and vases of Hyacinths. Mr. Mac- 
 kenzie exhibited Camellias, a new seedling of a rosy-pink 
 color, his Ellen and Peine des fleurs. Cut Camellias of the 
 finest varieties were exhibited by Mr. Buist's, Mr. Cope's, 
 and Mr. Lambert's gardeners. D. R. King's gardener pre- 
 sented a Moss Vase, bearing a fine pyramid of flowers. Six 
 beautiful baskets of cut flowers were shown by the garden- 
 ers of Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Cope, Mr. Tucker and Mr. Lam- 
 bert. A brace of Cucumbers from Mr. Tucker's, and a dish 
 of Asparagus from Mr. Cope's houses, were on the tables. 
 The following premiums were awarded by the Committee on 
 Plants and Flowers — twelve cut Camellias — for the best, to 
 Robert Buist ; for the second best to Jerome Graff, gardener 
 to C. Cope. Collection of twelve plants — for the best, to 
 Thomas Robertson, gardener to B. A. Fahnestock; for the 
 second best, to Robert Buist. Collection of six plants — for 
 the best, to Wm. Thompson, gardener to J. Tucker. Speci- 
 men plant — for the best, to Thomas Robertson, gardener to 

B. A. Fahnestock ; for the second best, to Robert Buist. 
 New plants — a premium of three dollars to Robert Buist, 
 for Dendrobium Wallichianum, Azalea Iveryana and Gera- 
 nium Show Ball. Table design — for the best, to Cornelius 
 O'Brien, gardener to D. Rodney King. Basket — for the 
 best, to Mark Hill, gardener to M. W. Baldwin ; for the 
 second best, to Jerome Graff, gardener to C. Cope. Bouquets 
 — for the best pair, to J. J. Habermehl, gardener to John 
 Lambert ; for the second best, to Jerome Graff, gardener to 

C. Cope. For a splendid seedling Camellia, the silver medal, 
 to Robert Buist. Special premiums of one dollar each, for 
 fine Baskets, were awarded to Wm. Thompson, gardener to 
 J. Tucker ; to Mark Hill, gardener to M. W. Baldwin, and 
 to J. J. Habermehl, gardener to John Lambert. The Com- 
 mittee noticed a fine seedling Camellia by P. Mackenzie; a 
 dozen beautiful seedling Cinerarias by John Tucker's gar- 
 dener, and a fine seedling Azalea and Hyacinths by Peter 
 Raabe. 

By the Committee on Vegetables — Special premiums of 
 one dollar each, to Wm. Thompson, gardener to John Tuck- 
 er, for a brace of cucumbers, and to Jerome Graff, gardener 
 to Caleb Cope, for a dish of asparagus. 

The Committee of Finance reported upon the Treasurer's 
 statement of accounts. 

A bill for printing transactions was ordered to be paid. 

An interesting letter was read from Dr. Joseph AVilson, 
 Jr., Surgeon, of the U. S. Navy, from U. S. ship Supply, on 
 Chinese horticulture. 

Dr. Brinckle resigned his office of Corresponding Secre- 
 tary. 

On motion, ordered that the Special Committee to confer 
 with City Councils on the subject of so arranging Lemon 
 Hill grounds so as to provide for the establishment of a Bo- 
 tanic Garden, be instructed to embrace also Hunting Park as 
 an arboretum, and the general improvement of any other 
 public squares. 

Seed Corn — Birds — Worms. 

For the past ton years I have succeeded in preserving 
 my corn from the depredations of birds and worms, by a 
 very simple and easy process. I throw about half a bushel 
 of seed at a time into an iron kettle, and then add about 
 three half gills of tar, stirring the mass briskly in the 
 meanwhile; then continue stirring until every grain looks as 
 if it had received a coat of varnish. To know when the pro- 
 cess is completed, throw the corn into a heap against one 
 side of the kettle, and if right it will creep slowly back 
 again, and in time regain something approaching a hard sur- 
 face. This part of the operation, which need not at any 
 time occupy ten minutes, is facilitated by doing it under a 
 hot sun. 

Next sift about a quart of dry slacked lime over the corn, 
 and then stir until every grain is coated with lime and ren- 
 dered perfectly dry. Three minntes will suffice to do this. 
 In the absence of lime, wood ashes will answer very well. 

Birds cannot or will not eat corn so treated. They may 
 pull up a stalk or two, but when they find how matters 
 stand, they leave for some other field. 

It was to guard against the depredations of birds, that I 
 adopted this device ; but I found by experience, that it not 
 only preserved corn against them, but that worms would not 
 cut stalks springing from tarred seed. Doubtless some slight 
 traces of the tar is taken up by the young plant, and being 
 as is well known, highly offensive to all animals of that 
 kind, the plant escapes from the attacks of this enemy 
 also. 

The seed germinates as quickly, and the plants come up as 
 uniformly and'vigorously, as if planted bare. Indeed, ever 
 since I adopted this method, I have had neither loss, trouble 
 nor anxiety from birds or worms ; and if I could have my 
 way, no one should kill a crow or blackbird on my premises, 
 or in my neighborhood. JOSIAH COPLEY.

An Interesting Inquiry. — Continued. 

Mr. Darlington: — In the January number of the Farm 
 Journal,under the heading of "An Interesting Inquiry," by 
 C. W. B. of Camden, N. J., on the subject of raising corn, 
 or rather, why it is that he cannot raise as much as he could 
 twenty years back, even when his land has been limed and 
 manured "liberally." 

Though our soil differs materially from that described by 
 C. W. B., being limestone gravel, mixed with sandy loam, 
 naturally good for producing corn, but of late j'ears we 
 have experienced something of the same results ; I say we, 
 for a number of my neighbors that I have spoken with have 
 experienced the same. Corn will come up and look as well 
 as usual, until the third or fourth leaf puts out, when it be- 
 gins to assumo a stunted appearance, and if a favorable sea- 
 son it may attain to the height of two and a half to three 
 and a half feet high, with striped leaves, seldom having an 
 ear on it. I have been careful to examine if it might not be 
 affected by some worm or insect, but have hitherto discover- 
 ed nothing, except the first or principal root is dead. We 
 will perhaps not find more than two or three hills in a place, 
 in another place we will find half a dozen, or more, and I 
 think I may say it is only thus affected on land that has 
 been limed some time; here we have been almost forced to 
 the conclusion that too much lime is the cause. As the corn 
 crop is an important one to the farmer, and becoming yearly 
 more so, I would like through your useful "Journal" to 
 have the opinion of others more experienced, and the anti- 
 dote, if there is one. R- H. L.
