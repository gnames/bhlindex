The New American Pastoral. 

By the politeness of the Publishers, Parry & M'Millan, 
 corner of Fourth and Chesnut streets, Philadelphia, we are in 
 receipt of a copy just published of "The New Pastoral," by 
 Thomas Buchanan Read, a native of Chester county. 

Following the example of Cowper and Thompson, the 
 design of the author appears to have been, to describe the 
 rural life of America, its associations, pleasures and familiar 
 phases, to open out to public view, both in the new and old 
 world, the very heart and pulse of our people, as illustrated 
 in their daily, familiar history. 

With how much minuteness and accuracy he has succeeded, 
 may be observed in the following extract. No American 
 can read this book without recognizing its truthfulness, 
 graphic descriptions, and truly poetical and happy illustra- 
 tions of every day life in America, It is so exceedingly 
 natural, that one educated in the country is at a loss to 
 know "how he could have written any thing else." 

The "New Pastoral" pursues a newand hitherto untrodden 
 path by any of our American Poets, supplying a vacuum, 
 long wanting. It is truly national in its spirit and tone, 
 giving utterance occasionally to lofty and patriotic senti- 
 ments, which must find a response in every heart. It will 
 be welcomed as the first truly American Poem, and we hope 
 to see the ground thus broken, speedily occupied by future 
 efforts in the same direction. 

We predict for the "new Pastoral" an immense circulation. 
 It must become one of the indispensables for the centre 
 table in America, both in the palace and the cottage. 

Day dawns, 
 And with it swells the sounds, afar and near, 
 Of lowing cattle, and the crowing cocks. 
 From farm to farm the wakening signals run, 
 And the blue smoke ascends. The sheep, released, 
 Leap the low bars and, following their bell, 
 do bleating to the pasture. And, anon, 
 The ploughman drives his team into the field, 
 And treads the furrow till the horn recalls. 
 Meanwhile the kine their generous udders yield, 
 And fill the sounding pail, till it o'erruns, 
 And drips the path with foam. Then, at the spring, 
 The snowy liquid poured in careful rows. 
 And on the watery slabs arranged to cool, 
 Gleams like a series of full moons. Afar 
 The giant forge, at labour 'midst the hills, 
 Throbs sullen thunder from its iron heart, 
 And 'neath yon poplar, bursting into bloom, 
 The lesser anvil rings. While from tho cot 
 Which on the breezy upland greets the east, 
 Tho windows blazing with the morning red, 
 The loom makes answer with its busy beat. 

Look in to-day upon the murmuring school. 
 There sits the old man at his wonted desk, 
 Round which the scholars stand in crescent rows, 
 Class after class, the oldest coming first; 
 Then, gradually descending, till the child , 

In russet slip comes tottering to his feet, 
 And finds a place upon the knte of age, 
 Where dimpled fingers point the letters wrong, 
 Or stray unchided to the master's watch-seals. 
 How like a hive, the busy school house hums! 
 Till comes the hour of recess, when in streams, 
 With laughter loud, they pour into the air, 
 And join in various games. * * * * 
 Now bloom the orchards, and the noisy bees 
 Sing like a wind among the snowy limbs. 
 The occupants of neighbouring garden hives 
 Are there, in full communities, to mine 
 The odorous Eldorado ; and the wasp 
 Dropping his long legs, like a flying crane, 
 Lights on the flower, and, with his ready sting, 
 Threats the intruder. There the humble-bee 
 Comes booming, and departs with laden thighs. 
 The yellow-jacket, small and full of spite, 
 Bedecked in livery of golden lace, 
 Comes with the fretful arrogance of one 

Who plays the master, though himself a slave; 

And over all, the tyrant of the hour, 

Tho kingbird, hovers, darting on his prey; 

And takes tho ventured argosy of sweets, 

Then boosts his conquest on the adjacent branch, 

Where, like a pirate hauled against the wind, 

He waits another sail. From limb to limb, 

The birds which here delight to build their nests- 

The blue-bird, and the robin, and the small 

Gray wood-pecker- — now flit among the flowers, 

Until the air is full of life and song, 

As it is full of perfume. Now begins 

The housewife's happiest season of the year. 

The ground already broken by the spade — 

The beds, made level by the passing rake — 

The almanac consulted, and the signs 

Conspiring favour — forth with apron full 

Of choicest seeds, the best which last year gave, 

She sallies to the garden where, all day, 

Breathing the pleasant odour of the mould, 

She bends and plants, while, to her eye of hope, 

Here springs tho early pea, and there the bean, 

The lettuce and the radish, and what else 

Her culinary providence requires. 

The Pennsylvania Farm School. 

It will be recollected that the Legislature, last winter, 
 passed an act incorporating an institution with the above 
 title ; but owing to certain defects, it was found imprac- 
 ticable to effect an organization, and the friends of the 
 measure were induced to ask the present General As- 
 sembly to pass another bill, which has been done. This 
 bill will be found on another page. At the time of send- 
 ing our forms to the stereotyper's it had not received 
 the signature of the Governor, but we learn there is no 
 doubt he will sign it in due time. 

The bill, although not perfect, is, in our humble judg- 
 ment, a great improvement on the act of last winter. 
 The most serious defect which we observe, is the ab- 
 sence of any appropriation to aid in establishing the 
 school. We had hoped from the number of enlightened 
 and liberal minded gentlemen in the Legislature, that an 
 appropriation of at least ten thousand dollars would be 
 made to aid the institution, which, if wisely managed, 
 as we have no doubt it will be, must add greatly to the 
 products, income and property of the State at large. 
 But in this we have been disappointed- 

To any one who will reflect for a moment on the ad- 
 vantages which must necessarily arise from an institu- 
 tion of this kind, the sum of ten thousand, or twenty 
 thousand dollars, appropriated towards establishing it, 
 shrinks into utter insignificance, comparable only to the 
 penny-wise and pound-foolish policy of the niggardly 
 throughout the world. 

It should be remembered, and we trust our law-makers 
 will not lose sight of the fact, that this is not a mere 
 private enterprise or speculation, intended to benefit 
 corporators or stockholders. Nor is it intended to be a 
 local concern with circumscribed limits of usefulness. 
 On the contrary, it is designed to be a State Institution, 
 drawing its students from, and spreading its light over, 
 every part of the Commonwealth. Those who are mov- 
 ing in the matter are doing it from the most disinter- 
 ested motives, desiring only the diffusion of agricultural 
 science among their fellow citizens, and the utmost im- 
 provement in their husbandry. They have no prospect 
 of gain, which is not common to every citizen of the 
 State. If the members of the Legislature, nine-tenths 
 of whom are the representatives of farming constituents,
