icana, Calycanthus, and a large number of others. We 
 consider no lawn perfect without all these we have named. 
 Their grouping and arrangement with proper taste will 
 of course increase the proper effect. 

We wish our farmers would not stint so much the 
 epace around their houses for ornamental purposes. A 
 spacious lawn and grass plot in front of the dwelling well 
 supplied with the above list of trees, we believe would 
 often be worth $5,000 to the real bone fide selling value 
 of the property. 

We have known more than once such a lawn, well set 
 with grass and tastefully planted, to be the means of 
 selling many a farm and country seat. We would rec- 
 ommend it however not as a means of selling, but as an 
 inducement for keeping a comfortable homestead, and fas- 
 tening in the hearts of inmates both young and old, those 
 endearing attractions, which should ever cluster around 
 one's home and make it more beautiful than all other 
 places. A healthful moral influence is often thus exerted, 
 particularly on the minds of children of no slight impor- 
 ance. Again we say, Plant, Plant, Plant. 

Reading's Corn Sheller. 
 In our last number we gave an illustration of this val- 
 uable machine, manufactured by Mr. Sinclair, of Balti- 
 more. We have since learned that Mr. David Landreth, 
 Sixth Street near Market in this city, has the sole own- 
 ership of the patent right for Pennsylvania, with the ex- 
 ception of four counties. 

Grass Fields. 

It is often a serious loss when fields in wheat the pre- 
 vious season, and seeded down with the view to remain 
 in grass for several years, prove on examination, that 
 the grass seed either from dry weather or other causes 
 has very imperfectly taken. 

The usual rotation, which requires each field to be 
 plowed in its turn, or as it may be required, is serious- 
 ly interfered with by such a mishap. 

In these cases, we would advise a few quarts of grass 
 seed to be sown to the acre on the surface, while the 
 frosts of spring have left it comparatively open, and 
 when the ground becomes dry enough pass over the rol- 
 ler. This will cover the seed, and very often cause it 
 to grow and vegetate beautifully, avoiding the necessity 
 of plowing up the field. 

An Englishman's Method of Feeding Stock. 

The following from an English Journal may furnish a 
 hint to American farmers: 

Mr. John Hutton, of Sowber Hill, near Northallerton, 
 England, has been taking into hand, for some years, poor, 
 wild, worn-out farms, as his tenants dropped, until he 
 has about fi fteen hundred acres or more, and has fol- 
 lowed out the system of steam-boiling linseed and meal, 
 combining this with chaff, and so feeding a large number 
 of cattle. He has thus renovated the worn-out soils, and 
 reduced the whole to a state of garden cultivation, com- 
 bined with the successful feeding of prime Short Horn 
 steers. A party of some 29 agriculturists lately inspec- 
 ted his farming operations, and the clean, healthy, and 
 happy condition of 50 well fed Short Horn steers, ready 
 for market, the sleek and almost fat condition of the 

straw fold or store cattle in his yards — many worse are 
 sold for fat — the healthy condition of his draught horses, 
 are evidencesof the value of linseed compound on which 
 they are fed — the fat cattle to the utmost limit, and the 
 store stock and horses once a day. To suit the expenses 
 of the times the following is the formula of his feed, and 
 as will be seen, the cost of feeding is at this dear season 
 not more than 6s. per week: —

The food given to the draught horse is 1 lb. of lin- 
 seed and 3 lbs. of meal, at noon, at the cost of 4c\d per 
 day. The small quantity of roots per day — taking the 
 minimum of 70 lbs. — would, in 20 weeks, amount to some 
 4-£ tons only, thus finding all the roots necessary for 
 feeding four cattle on 1 acre of a 20 ton per acre crop.

The Guano Trade. 1 
 The very extensive increase in the use of guano, as a 
 fertilizer of the earth, has caused the trade in it to be- 
 come exceedingly important. The number of vessels 
 that arrived at the port of Baltimore, the past year, 
 loaded with guano was one hundred and thirty-five, 
 mostly ships of the largest class. Assuming the freight 
 paid to those from Peru, to be an average of twenty-eight 
 dollars per ton, the freight money alone amounts to $1,- 
 025,000. The whole value of guano imported from Peru, 
 at fifty dollars per ton, is $3,150,000, and that from 
 other ports, at twenty-five dollars per ton, is over $255,- 
 000, making the value of the guano imported into Bal- 
 timore the past year, nearly three and a half millions of 
 dollars. It is to be remarked that the largest import of 
 guano has been into Baltimore, and without correct data, 
 it is assumed that the quantity imported equals that of 
 all other cities of the Union. At the close of the year, 
 the supply is very large, being computed to be about 
 forty thousand tons, or about half the whole import of 
 the year. The market in the spring will therefore open 
 with a stock sufficient to meet almost any demand, but 
 in the meantime supplies are not expected to continue 
 as freely as heretofore, as it is understood that but few 
 vessels have been chartered to proceed to the islands 
 within the past three months. We subjoin the import 
 for the past year, and for several years previous : 

Imports of Guano for 1854. — Peruvian, 58,927; Mexi- 
 can, 6,613; African, 627; Total, 66,168 tons. 

Imports of Peruvian Guano into Baltimore for six years. 
 —1849 2,700 tons; 1850, 6,800; 1851,25,000; 1852, 52,- 
 500; 1853, 32,152; 1854, 68,727. 

Good Pen of Pigs. 
 Mr. John Stepleton, of Willistown, Chester county, 
 slaughtered nine hogs about two weeks since, the weight 
 of which were as follows:— 439, 497, 431, 489, 435, 399, 
 434, 423. There have been few lots of pigs slaugtered 
 the present season that can beat the above.
