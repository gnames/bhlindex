Farm Journal Stock Register. 

Since our removal to Philadelphia, we have had nume- 
 rous calls from persons desirous of purchasing various 
 kinds of stock, as to when and where they could be sup- 
 plied. We have given all the information we possessed — 
 often but limited. In order to meet these calls more sat- 
 isfactorily, we have opened a Stock Register in our office 
 in which we propose to keep a memorandum of all stock 
 of whatever kind for sale, of which we may be informed ; 
 and also of all wants by persons desirous of purchasing. 
 Breeders and others will benefit themselves, and facilitate 
 sales, by leaving with us for entry, descriptions of ani- 
 mals they may have for sale, with price, &c, &c. No 
 charges will be made for the entry.

 Swiss Cows. 
 Of improved cattle the English races only are gener- 
 ally known in the United States. We hear only of Dur- 
 kains, Devons, Alderneys, &c, as if England only, raised 
 the best cattle in the world. With very expensive out- 
 lays, pure races are imported from Great Britain, and by 
 crossing with them and great care in keeping, the native 
 cattle are greatly improved. It passes, however, reflec- 
 tion and recollection that the English cattle have not only 
 been gradually improved by great care, but that former- 
 ly England imported good cattle from the continent of 
 Europe to improve their native breeds, as is now the 
 case here with regard to English cattle. Holland, Hol- 
 stein, Switzerland, Tyrol and Styria produced for a long 
 time races of cattle that were far superior to the En- 
 glish. And why should such cattle not be imported di- 
 rectly now with us ? When we reflect that from those 
 countries, from Switzerland, better cattle, at one-fourth 
 of the price of English cattle, can be imported, why is 
 the attention of breeders not called to that fact ? 

Some years ago a trial was made in Maryland by im- 
 porting cattle from Holstein, and we learn that at the 
 South they are about to import cattle direct from Berne, 
 Switzerland. Mr. Robert Nelson, a Dane, of Macon, in 
 Georgia, is about leaving for- Switzerland to purchase 
 about twenty head of cattle for planters in Georgia and 
 Alabama, and will execute more orders for them. He 
 contemplates leaving in June, and later commissions 
 can be sent him through the American Consuls in Basle 
 or Berne. Mr. Nelson can purchase the best cattle there 
 for $150, and land and sea transportation will cost about 
 $200 more. A gentleman from Maryland, well acquaint- 

ed with Mr. Nelson, thus speaks of him: "With regard 
 to Mr. Nelson's adaptation for the undertaking, I have 
 not the least doubt. I made his acquaintance last year 
 during a tour in Georgia. I found him a thoroughly 
 practical man, who possesses the fullest confidence of 
 the most estimable and enterprising planters in this 
 State." 

The editor of the Cotton Planter visited Mr. Nelson 
 lately at his nursery in Georgia, and expresses himself 
 as follows about the Berne race of cattle as it was im- 
 parted to him by Mr. Laman, of Macon, entirely in ac- 
 cordance with Mr. Nelson's description. Mr. Laman says: 
 "I am just returned from Europe, and in Switzerland 
 I saw the Berne cattle, and found them far preferable 
 to any of the English races with which I am acquainted. 
 The Berne cows are undoubtedly the finest in the world." 
 He says further : < 'On board the Asia, in which I re- 
 turned from Liverpool, there was a fine Durham cow to 
 be delivered at New York for £200 sterling, or $960, 
 and I have seen many a Berne cow near Berne, which 
 I would not give for two such Durham cows." Mr. La- 
 man is a gentleman well known in Georgia. 

The following is Mr. Nelson's account about this race : 

' 'I must remark that my father has carried on hus- 
 bandry and cattle raising for fifty years with the great- 
 est care, if not more extensively than any body else on 
 the continent of Europe ; further, that I have been reg- 
 ularly trained to that business, and had assisted him 
 many years, until political affairs compelled me to emi- 
 grate to the United States. 

"For many years we tried all the highly extolled En- 
 glish races, such as Durham, North Devon, Ayrshire, 
 Alderney, and others ; the result was we discarded them 
 all and tried the Swiss race. When in 1825 I travelled 
 through Europe to see and learn as much as possible of 
 all that belongs to husbandry and cattle raising, I 
 brought home to Denmark several kinds of Swiss cattle, 
 such as Switz, Fribourg and Berne. The last showed 
 itself the most preferable with regard to milk as well as 
 meat. They are large, extraordinary milkers, and very 
 gentle. As certain characters wanted to show their con- 
 ceited knowledge by finding fault with all new underta- 
 kings, many prophecies were made about their inaptness 
 for our climate, but they all proved false, for when these 
 cattle were kept on the same pastures and in the same 
 stables with our own, and had the same feed, the result 
 was entirely in their favor ; and as it is generally known 
 that individual cows, or individual races, give much bet- 
 er milk than others, the milk of the Berne cows was by
