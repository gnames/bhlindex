after my rape, when lo ! not a single plant had survived 
 the winter ! Thus my fair proportioned castle vanished 
 into nothing. 

However, I observed that poultry were very fond of 
 the plants, and probably a patch might be sown with 
 profit for turkey pasture, and as the plants late in the 
 season are profusely covered with lice, this mixture of 
 vegetable and animal food might cause Shanghais to lay, 
 and eggs are mostly high in price at that season. 

But I do not consider the result of my experiment 
 with rape seed as conclusive against the possibility of 
 raising it. Something may have been wrong either in 
 the seed or in some other way, and I would be willing 
 to try a small quantity again, but not "an acre or 
 more." 

It is singular that a crop which is cultivated with so 
 much success in Belgium, France and England, has nev- 
 er become a profitable crop in the United States. If 
 it will succeed here, surely the agriculturists of this 
 country are not so stupid as to be unable to perceive its 
 importance. 

In the September number of the Farm Journal, 1853, 
 in an article headed "Poppy," and signed F. A. Nauts, 
 it is stated that so long ago as 1822 or 1823 an English- 
 man in Salem county, N. J., sowed rape on two acres of 
 ground, and under very unfavorable circumstances real- 
 ized $156 from the oil alone obtained from forty bushels 
 of seed that his two acres produced. 

Now, I have often wondered if rape generally pro- 
 duces so well in this country, why that Englishman did 
 not continue to raise it, why his neighbors did not imi- 
 tate him, and why the cultivation of rape did not be- 
 come common throughout the country. N. L.

Domestic Recipes. 

Indian Puffs. — Boil a quart of milk ; and when it 
 has come to a boil, stir into it, gradually, eight large 
 table-spoonfuls of Indian meal ; four large table-spoon- 
 fuls of powdered sugar ; and a grated nutmeg. Stir it 
 hard ; letting it boil a quarter of an hour after all the 
 Indian meal is in. Then take it up, and set it to cool. 
 While cooling, beat eight eggs as light as possible, and 
 stir them, gradually, into the batter when it is quite 
 cold. Butter some large tea-cups ; nearly fill them with 
 the mixture ; set them into a moderate oven ; and bake 
 them well. Send them to table warm, and eat them with 
 butter and molasses ; or with butter, sugar, lemon-juice, 
 and nutmeg stirred to a cream. They must be turned 
 out of the cups. 

Sumach Ink. — The milk or gum that exudes from 
 the sumach is a good substitute for durable ink. Break 
 off the stalks that support the leaves. Squeeze them 
 into a cup, and write with the liquid. Expose it to the 
 sun and it will become a fine black. 

To Clean Looking and Plate Glasses. — Take a 
 newspaper, or a part of one, according to the size of the 
 glass. Fold it small, and dip it into a basin of clean, 
 cold water. Wben thoroughly wetted, squeeze it out in 
 your hand, as you would a sponge ; and then rub it, 
 hard, all over the face of the glass ; taking care that it 
 is not so wet that the moisture will stream down the 
 glass. After the glass has been well rubbed, with the 

damp paper, let it rest a minute. Then go over it with 
 a fresh newspaper, (folded small in your hand,) till it 
 looks clear and bright ; which it will, almost immediate- 
 ly. Finish with a fresh piece of newspaper, thoroughly 
 dry. 

This method, simple as it is, will be found, on trial, 
 the best and most expeditious way of cleaning mirrors, 
 or any plate-glass ; giving a clearness and polish, that 
 cannot be so soon produced by any other process. The 
 jpside of window-panes may be cleaned in this manner; 
 the windows having been first washed on the outside. 
 Also, the glasses of spectacles, &c. The glass globe of 
 a lamp may thus be cleaned with newspapers. 

The efficacy is attributed to the materials used in ma- 
 king the printing-ink. 

To Destroy Bed-Bugs. — Among the numerous ways 
 of destroying bugs, there is none better than to wash 
 carefully, with a solution of corrosive sublimate in spir- 
 its of wine, all the cracks and crevices of the bedstead, 
 at least once a week ; taking care to throw out directly 
 whatever may remain in the bowl or saucer, which 
 should at once be washed clean in hot water. 

Mercurial ointment, rubbed once a week into all the 
 joints and crevices of the bedstead, is an excellent de- 
 stroyer of bugs. It can best be rubbed in with the fin- 
 ger. Leave it on the bedstead without wiping off ; and 
 do not put on the bedding till evening. 

Seedling Apples. 

Mr. Editor: — Being a reader of your Journal, I fre- 
 quently see notices of fruits ; some of which are new, 
 but supposed to contain valuable properties, and conse- 
 quently worthy of cultivation to some extent, at all 
 events. 

In the following I will give you a description of two 
 varieties, one of which is cultivated to a considerable ex- 
 tent in this county, and seldom found out of it. The 
 other I found last summer growing in an orchard in this 
 vicinity ; it is a seedling, and has never been cultivated 
 anywhere, nor propagated, except by some neighbors, 
 who have engrafted it on old stocks, &c. 

The first one we call the "Ewalt," deriving its name 
 from the owner of the farm on which it originated, one 
 and a half miles from Bedford. In size one of the 
 largest weighing over one pound in good seasons; green- 
 ish yellow, with a bright red cheek in the sun ; rather 
 acid, but with a sprightly flavor, excellent for desert and 
 cooking in the spring of the year, say March and April ; 
 tree, a strong and rapid grower, forming a dense head, 
 (in fact, I cultivate none in my nursery that grow more 
 vigorous and beautiful,) with a dark green foliage; is 
 highly esteemed here by a great many good judges, es- 
 pecially in the spring, and withall bearing immense 
 crops on all soils and situations. 

The second is a yellow autumn apple, ripe in October, 
 of a very large size, and of a sugary, sweet, tender and 
 delicious flavor, very valuable for cider, apple butter or 
 drying, &c. The gentleman on whose farm it is growing 
 told me he had known it for twenty years, and the fruit 
 is always large and fair, and that the grafts set on old 
 trees grow with an uncommon rapidity. No name has 
 been given it yet.
