any service to your numerous readers, I shall be amply 
 satisfied for the little trouble it has given me, as I am 
 anxious to have brought before the public such native 
 fruits as are to be found in our county, some of which 
 will be a vrluable acquisition to our stock. Yours, &c.

Was it a Mole? Or a Shrew 1 

Editor Farm Journal: — The common mole of our 
 country, Scalops aquaticees Linn; is classed among those 
 small animals, by naturalists termed Insectivorous ; fr"oni 
 the fact of their subsisting on insect food, when it can 
 be procured. Their character is not, however, entirely 
 derived from observations made upon their habits — it is 
 also inferred from the structure of their mandibulary 
 organs. 

The teeth of some animals are furnished with broad, 
 fiat, surfaces, cut into ridges and hollotvs, and the infe- 
 rior jaw provided with a lateral motion by which arrange- 
 ment, vegetables and grains are ground, somewhat in the 
 manner of corn in the mill. They are called Herbivorous 
 animals (from herba and voro,) herb-eaters. 

In others, the teeth present a number of broad, lancet 
 shaped, projections; which with the vertical motion of 
 the lower jaw, are admirably adapted to the -purpose of 
 cutting flesh; after the fashion of a modern sausage cut- 
 ter. They are called Carnivorous animals, (from caro 
 and voro,) flesh-eaters. 

Again, we find another set of animals, whose teeth do 
 not present the grinding surfaces of the one, or the 
 trenchant edges of the other, which has been mentioned 
 but are studded over with sharp, bristly, points suited 
 for seizing, and masticating, insect food. They are call- 
 ed Insectivorous animals, (from insect and voro,) — insect- 
 eaters. 

The mole as already stated, belongs to the latter class. 
 Its habits, when carefully studied, seem well adapted to 
 this mode of subsistence. Thus, it forms numerous and 
 very extensive subterranean passages; it does not burrow 
 deep into the earth, but keeps near the surface, and 
 among roots of grass, &c, where the insects, and es- 
 pecially their larva?, most abound. Another trait of his 
 character is that he industriously traverses his roads back 
 and forward, from morning till night, and, may be during 
 the night also. Now it is not to be supposed, that his 
 sole object, in burrowing is to obtain whatever insects may 
 fall in his track. If so he would continue^io open new 
 grounds. No! led by that unerring instinS, with which 
 he has been furnished by an All-Wise Crefftor, he makes 
 his burrows thus extensive, for pitfalls, and visits them thus 
 frequent in order to secure the insects, which may have 
 fallen therein. Doubtless, he greatly prefers insect to 
 vegetable food, and were the former always abundant, 
 might reject the latter altogether ; but where the one fails 
 he is so far Omnivorous, (from omnis and voro) all-eater; 
 as to partake, without scrapie of the jother. Hence, both 
 garden and field crops, are liable to injury from his dep- 
 redations upon seeds and roots. 

I am aware that some charitably minded persons; — 
 generous to a fault; — relying upon his insectivorous 
 teeth; — deny the charge, and accuse his accusers with 
 being guilty of a gross libel upon his character. They 
 say that he is one of the husbandman's best friends; that 
 so far from injuring the crops, he merely feeds upon the 

insects which would otherwise have done them an injury. 
 The real injury, they say, is done by shrews, (Soux) and 
 c/round mice (Awicole) which avail themselves of the bur- 
 rows formed by the mole, to gain access to the under 
 ground products of the farmer, and gardener. This I 
 believe is sometimes the case, but not always. The most 
 cunning, and adroit, pilferer will sometimes be detected 
 when he feels most secure. So it was in the case which 
 I am about to relate. 

My garden is partly surrounded by woodland, and 
 partly by grass plots, and as might be expected, has 
 long been infested with moles; every year increasingly 
 so, till it became difficult to obtain a crop of almost any 
 kind. The larger seeds were eaten, as soon as planted, 
 the smaller ones destroyed while germinating, by the 
 displacement of the soil. Last season I planted peas 
 three different times, and in as many different places; — 
 they were only given to the moles, or to the shrews, or 
 to the ground mice. Which? — let me tell the reader. 
 I had by this time, lost my wonted equanimity, and re- 
 solved upon punishing the varmints. To do this I mixed 
 a few grains of arsenic with flour, and then rolled a 
 dozen soaked peas in the mixture while they were wet. 
 Thus armed I went into the garden, and made a hole 
 with my finger, into the moles track, in two places, where 
 they had long preserved a thoroughfare across the walk. 
 Into these holes I dropped my peas. 

The moles, being insectivorous, would of course, pass 
 by the poisoned bait; but the shrews, and mice, being 
 herbivorous, could not be expected to resist the tempta- 
 tion, — so read the book. The result was that from that 
 time forward, there was not the sign of a mole seen in 
 garden for four months. The moles did not open any 
 new burrows, and the shrews and mice, could not do it 
 for themselves, so my next planting of peas escaped their 
 depredations. E. M.

[The hint contained in the last paragraph is among 
 the best we have seen, for the destruction of moles. Dr. 
 Emerson, in his Encyclopedia, mentions the use of shreds 
 of lean beef, poisoned with arsenic or strychnine; but 
 unless the moles find it soon, the beef becomes tainted, 
 and seems unpleasant to the delicate taste of the mole.]

More Durham Stock for Chester County. 
 " We lately had the pleasure of examining at the stables 
 of our friend A. Clement, in South street below Ninth 
 Philadelphia, a very superior Durham Bull calf some 
 three months old ; purchased by him of L. Spencer, New 
 York, for Paschall Worth, near West Chester, Chester 
 county, Pennsylvania, and then on his way to. the farm of 
 the latter. If we know any thing about stock, we should 
 pronounce this calf, giving promise of perfection, as he 
 does, in nearly every valuable point, to be one of the best 
 animals ever brought into Pennsylvania, and should no- 
 thing happen to him, he will add greatly to the reputa- 
 tion of Chester county, as containing the best stock in 
 this state, and be of vast advantage to her breeders. 

We have obtained his pedigree and insert it below. 
 It traces from the very best blood in England. His pres- 
 ent owner has concluded to call him Duke Athol 3d. 

Duke of Athol 3d., was bred by L. Spencer, New York; 
 color red, with very little white. Dam Faraway (im- 
 ported,) by 3d duke of Oxford (9,047), g. dam Felicia, by
