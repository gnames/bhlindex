and thus convert their food into fat, instead of rambling 
 it off, and it is to this sluggish quality, I ascribe the fact 
 that I have never lost a thorough bred by dogs ; they do 
 not .jump up and run when any thing comes into the 
 field, thus tempting dogs to the chase. They are large 
 sheep ; have been brought in England, by full treatment, 
 at 3 years old, thorough bred, to nett for the butcher 
 over 300 fts. Can any other breed of sheep give from 
 $2 to $5 in fleece in the spring he is one year old, and 
 in the fall of the same year without fail $10 as a mut- 
 ton, and draw butchers hundreds of miles to get them at 
 that, as they do here every year? can cattle do so? and 
 they have no fleece. Can they give $10 even the fall 
 after one year old ? and they consume infinitely more 
 per head. Then what animal can be so profitable to the 
 farmer as the Cotswold sheep for general farming purpo- 
 ses, returning its outlay with such certainty, so speedily 
 and so unceasingly ? Josiaii Wm. Ware.

Agricultural Enthusiasts. 
 Every profession has its enthusiasts ; and agriculture 
 in all its departments has them in abundance. Of those 
 who are especially interested in cultivation we have 
 teachers of deep and of shallow culture — of tilth without 
 manure — and of manure applied in the liquid form, or 
 as top-dressings in the solid form. In other divisions 
 of the subject we have devotees of plant improvement 
 and animal improvement. Poultry has absorbed the 
 whole regard of many; and there is many an ill cultiva- 
 ted farm occupied by men celebrated as breeders of 
 stock, to prove that it also too exclusively engages all 
 the energy of the tenant. Agricultural improvement 
 owes a great deal to enthusiasts. It makes progress 
 piecemeal in the hands of those who are thus interested 
 in but pieces of its whole extent. If it had not been for 
 Bake well, and for Colling s, the one giving a lifetime 
 to the improvement of the sheep, the other to the improve- 
 ment of the Teeswater breed of cattle, not only would 
 sheep and cattle not have been what they are, but British 
 agriculture generally would not have attained its present 
 powers as food supply of more than 20 millttfffs. Ama- 
 teurs as well as farmers may therefore all feel w«Jl dis- 
 posed towards agricultural enthusiasts. — London Agri-

Diseases of Horses. 

Sleepy Staggers. — This disease is named sleepy from 
 the fact that its most characteristic sympton is that of 
 coma or somnolency. The subject may be surrounded by 
 all the noise and confusion of a city stable, yet, in the 
 midst of this, and at any time, day or night, will fall 
 fast asleep with his mouth full of fodder. On arousing 
 him, he evinces some alarm ; yet almost immediately, 
 and while standing by his side, he is off into what ap- 
 pears to be a sound nap. 

There are other features in the case that enable the 
 observer to make out a diagnosis, such as stertorous 
 breathing ; slowness of respiration ; slow, soft pulse ; 
 amaurotic eyes (generally closed); the head either droop- 
 ing or pressed forward into the crib. In most cases the 

excrement is hard and knobby ; the urine scanty. 

The disease probably originates in derangement of the 
 stomach and its associate digestive organ. It is very 
 apt to terminate fatally, either from effusion or extrava- 
 sation. 

Treatment. — Here we are at fault, not having been 
 very successful in bringing such cases to a favorable 
 termination. We remember one case, however, that 
 was considered hopeless ; and by way of experiment we 
 administered the unwarrantable dose of half a pound of 
 lobelia, expecting at the same time that it would cause 
 his death ; but, contrary to our expectations, he recov- 
 ered. The remedy was followed up by stimulating in- 
 jections and cold water bandages around the head. 

The lobelia seemed to have no other effect than to 
 produce profuse perspiration, and this suggested the 
 idea of placing such patients in a vapor bath — an idea 
 that we have not yet been able to carry out. There is 
 no doubt, however, that nauseating meiikine, in con- 
 junction with the warm bath, will do as mu^h to relieve 
 congestion in the horse as they have accomplished in 
 human medicine. 

If we had nothing but simple congestion to contend 
 with in the treatment of this malady, our success would 
 be more certain ; but ca!ses now and then occur when 
 some morbid change takes place in the structure of the 
 brain, so that our treatment avails nothing. The treat- 
 ment most likely to succeed in a curable case consists in 
 the administration of nauseating medicines. One drachm 
 of lobelia, with half the quantity of bloodroot, may be 
 given in warm water every hour. A dose of cathartic 
 medicine should be administered in the early stage of 
 the disease, followed by injections of salt and water. 
 Counter irritation may also be of service when applied 
 to the extremities. 

Cathartics and nauseants must* be our sheet anchor, 
 and should be repeated until a free evacuation has taken 
 place ; for they have a tendency to lessen the force of 
 the circulation, and consequently relieve the brain. The 
 authomis well aware of the difficulty encountered in ad- 
 ministering medicine to horses laboring under disease of 
 the brain and its investing membranes ; the danger too, 
 both as regards the person of the physician and the life 
 of the patient, must be taken into consideration; for 
 there are times when the patient is unable to swallow, 
 and if we should then insist on forcing down a drench, a 
 portion of it might enter the air passages and choke 
 him. The attendant is at times in danger of personal 
 injury from the animal's suddenly falling ; but these 
 suggestions apply more to those forms of disease known 
 as inflammation of the brain. — Dr. Dadd. 

Guano for Spring Crops. 
 As to the profit of the use of guano, several prelimi- 
 naries are to be taken into consideration. Its cost com- 
 pared with other manures, the character of the soil to 
 which it is to be applied, and the prices commanded by 
 the article to be produced, will decide this question. 
 When good barn-yard manure is readily available, an 
 amount expended in its application will probably give a 
 return more profitable than the same sum in any other 
 fertilizing substance. As to soils, the effects of guano 
 are most marked and profitable on those badly worn and
