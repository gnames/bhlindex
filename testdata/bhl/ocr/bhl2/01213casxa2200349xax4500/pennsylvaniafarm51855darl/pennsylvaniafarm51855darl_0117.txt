exhausted. This is so because the materials it supplies 
 most abundantly are there most deficient. Very poor 
 land brought at once to fertility shows a change so great 
 as readily to be noticed, while a fair medium soil, com- 
 ing up to the same point, will attract little attention. 
 As to kind of soil, those of a sandy and loamy nature, 
 and well-drained clays, show the effects of guano, as 
 well as those of all other manures, longer and more vis- 
 ibly than those of a contrary character. As to prices of 
 products — guano can be used profitably on the wheat 
 crop while that grain sells for $2 per bushel, but not 
 when it brings but $1. Corn at $1, and potatoes above 
 50 cents, will warrant its use in their production. That 
 is, the increase in the crop at these prices caused direct- 
 ly by this manure, will pay all the expense of its appli- 
 cation, and leave a profit besides. 

Quantity and manner of application are the subjects 
 of the second query. From 150 to 300 lbs. per acre 
 may be used, according to the quality of the soil. In 
 applying it broadcast, it was formerly the practice to 
 mix with it about one-quarter its weight of plaster, and, 
 pulverizing the whole finely, to sow it evenly and then 
 harrow, cultivate or plow it in, as soon as possible. 
 This should be done immediately before sowing. At 
 present it is generally recommended to pulverize and 
 sow without any mixture of plaster. The great fertili- 
 zing principles of guano are the phosphate of lime and 
 ammonia, the latter very volatile in its nature. Hence 
 the necessity of applying it unchanged to the soil, to 
 give forth to the growing plant, and not to the passing 
 winds, its valuable properties. In applying it to corn 
 and potatoes, it is generally planted with the seed, but 
 great care should be taken that it does not come in con- 
 tact, or it will destroy its vitality, otherwise it could be 
 dropped with a machine at the same time with the corn, 
 as our correspondent proposes. Ashes or lime should 
 never be mixed with guano before its application to the 
 soil. 

"Where and at what price it can be obtained?" will 
 be answered by consulting the advertising department of 
 almost any number of this paper. We believe the price 
 at present is about $55 per ton. In conclusion, allow 
 us to remark that we shall be glad to publish accounts 
 of experiments in the use of guano on any of the crops 
 mentioned above, particularly if they furnish data for 
 calculating the profits. — Rural Neio Yorker. 

Resuscitating Fruit Trees. 

A correspondent in the Germantown Telegraph gives 
 the following statement of an experiment in resuscitating 
 an old apple tree : 

"On my farm there is an apple tree of very large size, 
 standing by the side of the road, but some two rods 
 within the line of the fence, and in lands that have been 
 cultivated regularly, either in roots, grass, or grains, 
 till within a period of twelve years, when a change in 
 my field operations, induced me to turn it out to pasture. 
 Some twenty years since — and about six years before I 
 became acquainted with it — this tree rather abruptly 
 ceased bearing. Its age at the time was unknown. 
 Thinking that it might be resuscitated, I commenced the 
 undertaking by digging around the trunk to the distance 
 of the longest limbs, and to depth of one foot, inverting 

the sward, and placing it over the roots, and in im- 
 mediate contact with them. On this sward, I sowed 
 quick lime, wood ashes and gypsum — one bushel of each 
 being used — and covered it with chaffed oat straw to the 
 depth of two inches, when compressed ; fine soil was 
 then thrown on till the excavation was nearly filled ; af- 
 ter which a cart load of fine compost was dumped on 
 and evenly spread over the whole. The dead limbs were 
 next cut out, and the top reduced to one-half its former 
 size. The cavities caused by the falling off of old and 
 decayed limbs, two cases extended nearly to the centre 
 of the trunk, were filled with "Forsyth's Cement," and 
 all the limbs which could be reached, or safely got at in 
 any way, were scraped and washed with suds. This 
 work was performed in the spring of 1850. The next 
 year the tree blossomed, and produced a few apples, 
 which matured. The next season, the bearing was 
 abundant, and since then, it has not ceased to produce a 
 good crop." 

New Rochelle Blackberry. 

In an age of humbugs, when "Sarsaparilla Palaces," 
 "Barnum Biographies," and numerous other nostrums, 
 bear abundant evidence to the gullibility of our people, 
 it is really refreshing to see some nevj thing that is not a 
 humbug. Such is the New Rochelle or Lawton Black- 
 berry, the origin of which is related at page 217 of our 
 third volume. It is really a mammoth blackberry, of 
 delicious flavor, entirely distinct vai'iety, and worthy of 
 general cultivation. The high price, $6 per dozen 
 plants, at which they are at present offered, being en- 
 tirely beyond the reach of editors, we can only recom- 
 mend our friends to purchase, believing fully there is no 
 deception this time. We have never yet had the oppor- 
 tunity of tasting them, but look forward to the time with 
 no little interest when they shall be as plenty as other 
 "blackberries," when there will be a chance even for 
 editors. 

Why do not our farmers devote some attention to 
 blackberry cultivation? We believe it would be very 
 profitable. There is hardly a more useful and whole- 
 some fruit than blackberries for both summer and win- 
 ter. We have never yet known the market overstocked 
 with them. Let any farmer select an acre of good, 
 clean, mellow ground, mark it out in rows four feet 
 apart, and plant it with good strong plants from his 
 thicket, and we believe it would pay him better than any 
 acre under ordinary farm culture, if he was within reach 
 of market. The canes should be trimmed like raspber- 
 ries, and the rows kept clean by the constant passage of 
 the cultivator. The blackberries would be found to im- 
 prove greatly in size, and also in abundant bearing. We 
 hope some of our readers will try it, and send us the re- 
 sults. 

Hedges. — Osage Orange. 
 Public opinion throughout the country seems to have 
 settled down upon the Osage Orange, as the hedge plant 
 for the United States, at least south of New York. It is 
 hardy, gi*ows fast, with proper management becomes 
 thick and impenetrable to stock of every kind, does not 
 sucker, is highly ornamental, and, as we have frequent- 
 ly before urged upon our readers, possesses every requi-
