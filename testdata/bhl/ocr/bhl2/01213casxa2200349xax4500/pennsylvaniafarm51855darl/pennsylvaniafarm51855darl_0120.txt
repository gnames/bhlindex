then one of the remainder. The beet-seed was bad, so 
 that only a small portion of it vegetated. The carrots 
 came up well, and when of a suitable size, were thinned to 
 about four inches apart. The whole received fair ordi- 
 nary cultivation during the summer, with the trees. 

The produce was as follows:

$157,50 

The ground sown to carrots measured but little over 
 one-third of an acre, and that in single rows three and 
 one-half feet apart. I am satisfied that the produce is 
 equal to full 1500 bushels per acre, if planted exclusive- 
 ly to carrots in the usual way, in rows 18 inches apart. 
 The onions occupied nearly double the area of ground 
 that the carrots did, and it will be seen were almost a 
 total failure, hardly paying for the seed. What few 
 plants the worms left, however, did well. The beets, 
 what vegetated of them, did well ; some of the largest 
 blood beets weighing sixteen pounds, and mangel wurt- 
 zel, eighteen pounds by actual weight. But the carrots 
 almost exceed belief. As it is, with the onions almost a 
 total, and the beets a partial failure, the produce of the 
 whole pays the total expense of cultivation, of trees and 
 all. 

I would state that the crop upon this ground did not 
 appear to suffer at all from the unprecedented drouth of 
 last summer, while on ground of almost exactly the same 
 character, not drained with me, the crop was gi-eatly in- 
 jured by drouth. The philosophy of this, after a little 
 observation and reflection, is plain. The clayey soil, 
 and still stiffer clay subsoil, retain the water of the win- 
 ter and melting snows until a late period in the spring ; 
 so much so that such land is not fit to work until two or 
 three weeks later than more porous soil. It is thus for 
 a long period over-charged with water. Then, if a 
 drouth follows, it bakes and cracks, and is about as per- 
 meable to the roots of plants, and capable of affording 
 about as much nourishment as a sun-dried brick when 
 ready for the kiln. On the contrary, if well drained, 
 this water passes off freely, so that the soil retains no 
 more than its capillaries hold. It is in working condi- 
 tion in good season in the spring, and if well broken up 
 to a good depth, it keeps in an open, friable condition 
 from early spring till winter. This is my experience 
 with soil of this nature, and doubtless that of others. 
 In my opinion, the expense of draining stiff clay soil is 
 repaid by the fitting it for early working in the spring 
 alone. 

I should remark that on the two acres spoken of, 
 there was nothing like springy ground. The difficulty 
 with it had been simply the retention of water falling on 
 the surface. 

Some of my friends inquire if it is not over-doing the 
 thing ? If for our hot and dry summers, such thorough 
 draining will not rather injure the land by taking from 
 it its moisture, &c, and the difference between our cli- 
 mate and that of England, where draining is held in so 

high estimation, is cited cautious-wise, that injury may 
 be done, rather than benefit. My reply to this is, that 
 no land can be injured by taking from it all the water 
 that will run off. This I think will be admitted by most 
 without proof; but if proof is wanting, such cases as 
 the one I detailed would seem conclusive. 

I feel so much confidence in the improvement of the 
 soil by means of draining, that I have the last season 
 lain from four to five miles of drain on a little place two 
 miles from the city. On one swampy piece of half to 
 three-quarters of an acre, which probably had never be- 
 fore been free from water since creation, drained last fall 
 (1851) produced this year a good crop of corn; the 
 drains running water the whole summer, though no wat- 
 er passed from it previously, three or four months of 
 summer and early fall. 

I have used the tubular or sole tile, and think them 
 decidedly preferable to the horse-shoe tiles, or those 
 open at the bottom ; as the water running in them keeps 
 them clean. I have laid them mostly of the smaller 
 size, say 2 to 2J inches diameter, and 2J to 3 feet in 
 depth by 21-to 25 feet apart, in parallel lines according 
 to the character of the subsoil. The expense varies 
 with me from $-10 to $50 per acre when the whole 
 ground is drained. Very truly yours, &c,

Pratt's Ditch Digger. 

Mr. R. C. Pratt, of Canandaigua, N. Y., patented in 
 July, 1853, a machine for digging ditches, which proved 
 one of the best things exhibited at the late State Fair. 
 By its aid one man and two horses have frequently dug 
 150 rods of ditch three feet deep in one day; and from 
 50 to 150 (according to the nature of the soil) is consid- 
 ered a day's work. The machine consists substantially 
 of a scoop and revolving wheel — the scoop scraping and 
 the wheel carrying up the dirt until at a sufficient height 
 it is tumbled out upon the sides, at a little distance from 
 the ditch. Several repetitions of the operation is re- 
 quired before the ditch is sunk to a sufficient depth. 

The specimen exhibited at the late Fair was all 
 wrought iron, and weighed between 700 and 800 pounds. 
 The diameter of the main wheel was five feet, and the 
 breadth of the diggers or lifters fixed thereon, and that 
 of the scoop or curved channel in which they rise, is 
 about nine inches. Although the lifting apparatus is 
 thus narrow, it is practicable and indeed desirable, to 
 make the small plows or cutters which pare the side cuts 
 somewhat wider, so that a ditch of any width, from nine 
 to fifteen inches, may be excavated by the same machine. 

The weight of the dirt which is being lifted, the curved 
 channel, and in fact the whole machine, rests on the dig- 
 gers, which, like the floats of a paddle-wheel, project 
 from the periphery of the main wheel. As the machine 
 is drawn forward by the horses, the diggers are succes- 
 sively forced into the earth, and compel the wheel to ro- 
 tate — thus carrying up and discharging from the top all 
 earth caught by the scoop, which is in immediate contact 
 behind. On the extreme rear of the whole are adjusted 
 cutters or small plows, which pare the sides and tear tne 
 earth to a suitable distance below, ready for the next pas- 
 sage of the machine, so that after the first passage the 
 diggers are always pressed down in to the ground already
