Origin of Black Hawk. 

[The following article from the Boston Cultivator, is of 
 considerable length, but it is so conclusive, and the subject 
 so interesting to a large class of our readers, that we are in- 
 duced to copy it entire.] 

In various species, animals are now and then produced po- 
 ssessing some striking superiority, which they impress in a 
 marked degree on their offspring. It is well to preserve all 
 facts in regard to the origin of such animals, as they may 
 serve to form rules of guidance in the art of breeding. The 
 writer of this article has for several years interested himself 
 in procuring materials relating to the history of what is pop- 
 ularly known as the Morgan family of horses, including 
 the famous Black Hawk. The latter animal has justly ob- 
 tained a reputation as the sire of valuable roadsters and fast 
 trotters, which is believed never to have been equalled by 
 any other horse in this country. 

The main facts in regard to the origin of Black Hawk 
 have long been before the public. His owners have always 
 represented him as a colt of the well-known "Sherman 
 Morgan," and although this statement has been well sub- 
 stantiated, and has received general assent, there have been 
 persons, who, from what motive we will not say, have circu- 
 lated a story that he was begotten by a horse called "Pad- 
 dy." So long as this story was propagated without any re- 
 sponsible authority it could hardly be deemed of sufficient 
 consequence to require formal notice; but as it has lately 
 assumed a more tangible from through a correspondent of an 
 agricultural periodical, we have concluded to put the pub- 
 lic in possession of such information as will demonstrate its 
 utter groundlessness, and consign it to perpetual oblivion. 

The authorities to which we deem it proper to refer, will 
 be presented in the order, as to time, in which they occur. 
 The first is an extract from a letter of Benjamin Thurston, 
 of Lowell, who was for several years the owner of Black 
 Hawk, under whose training he was brought on the trotting 
 course, and by whom he was sold to Mr. Hill in 1844. Un- 
 der date of Oct. 7th, 1847, he says : 

"It gives me much pleasure to answer your letter, as I 
 feel a great interest in any thing which relates to Black 
 Hawk. I will answer your questions in the order in which 
 they are asked : 

"1st. Black Hawk was raised by Mr. Twombly, of Green- 
 land [formerly of Durham], N. II. 2d. He was begotten 
 by Sherman Morgan, owned by Mr. Bellows at that time. 
 3d. His dam was represented to be a half blood English 
 mare, raised in New Brunswick. She was finely proportion- 
 ed, and of great speed. Although never trained, I think 
 she could trot a mile in less than three minutes." 

This letter, it will be noticed, was written nearly eight 
 years ago. To show the estimation in which Black Hawk 
 and his progeny were then held by Mr. Thurston, it will not 
 be out of place to introduce another extract from the same 
 letter, as follows : 

"I bought Black Hawk when he was four years old; for 
 six years used him as my family horse, and think him, with- 
 out exception, the finest horse I ever knew. I have owned 
 a number of horses for the last twenty-five years, — varying 
 from ten to thirty-five at a time, — and have also been in the 
 habit of purchasing the finest I could find for sale; but if 
 the choicest qualities of the best horses I ever owned were 
 combined, I do not think they would produce an animal to 
 surpass Black Hawk. In the first place, he is the best road- 
 ster I ever drew rein over. I have frequently driven him 
 fifty miles in half a day, and once drove him sixty-three 
 miles in seven hours and fifteen minutes. He did it with 
 perfect ease, and indeed I never saw him appear fatigued. 
 At the time I owned him, I believe he could have trotted 
 one hundred miles in ten hours, or sixteen miles in one hour, 
 or one mile in two minutes and forty seconds. In the sec- 
 ond place, he has the best disposition of any horse I ever 
 knew, and is perfectly safe for a lady to ride or drive. 
 Thirdly, he will draw as kindly as any team-horse. His 

stock is unequalled. There is in this part of the country 
 some ten or twelve of his get, five or six years old. These 
 can trot a mile in from two minutes fifty-five seconds to two 
 minutes thirty-five seconds, and they sell at prices ranging 
 from $500 to $1,000. They are finely proportioned, good 
 sized, nice gaited, hardy, compact animals." 

We next introduce an extract from a letter written by 
 John Bellows, of Lancaster, N. II., (owner of the horse 
 Sherman Morgan,) to David Hill, of Bridport, Vt. It com- 
 prises an interesting description of the sire of Black Hawk. 
 Its date is March 24, 1S48: 

"In answer to inquiries relative to the origin of your fa- 
 mous horse Black Hawk, I state that he was foaled at Dur- 
 ham, N. H., the property of Wingate [Ezekiel] Twombly, 
 now of Greenland, N. H. She was a good sized, fast trot- 
 ting, black mare, resembling, in appearance, the Messenger 
 stock of norses. His sire, old Sherman Morgan, was truly a 
 prodigy among horses. lie was fourteen and a half hands 
 high ; his greatest weight while owned by me, 925 lbs.; of 
 chestnut color ; well strung in cord, muscular ; inaction ex- 
 hibiting wonderful strength and agility; though apparently 
 mettlesome, yst easy of control ; sagacious and patient in 
 trouble, and of matchless endurance. He had a lively coun- 
 tenance, with an amiableness of expression, captivating, in 
 effect, beyond any horse I have ever, seen. He was foaled 
 at Lyndon, Vt., in 1811, the property of James Sherman, 
 Esq., and died at my stable in January, 1835. But for this 
 animal, Morgan horses would never have had the celebrity 
 they enjoy. His dam was bought by Mr. Sherman of Dr. 
 Fiske, of Providence, R. I., and was said to have been im- 
 ported. She was of good size, and fine appearance; of a 
 chestnut color ; elegant in action, and a speedy trotter. His 
 [Sherman Morgan's] sire was the Goss [or Justin] Morgan, 
 brought to Randolph, Vt., by Col. Morgan." 

The mistake of Mr. Bellows in regard to the christian 
 name of Mr. Twombly, was corrected by him in other let- 
 ters, as will be seen. It was, however, inadvertently copied 
 in one or two printed notices of Black Hawk. The above 
 extract might be regarded as amply sufficient, so far as the 
 testimony of Mr. Bellows is required, but to show that his 
 statements have been entirely consistent on this point, — 
 whatever may have been intimated to the contrary, — we 
 give in full a letter of his to another person, written more 
 than two years after the above : 

Lancaster, N. H., Aug. 14, 1856. 

"Dear Sir : — Being absent on the arrival of your letter, 
 I now reply to your inquiry relative to the justly celebrated 
 horse 'Black Hawk,' formerly owned by Benjamin Thurston, 
 of Lnwell, Mass., and raised by E. Twombly, late of Green- 
 land, N. II. Said horse is, without doubt, a son of 'Old 
 Sherman Morgan,' — whatever may be said to the contrary 
 by persons prejudiced against the horse or his ow.ner, or from 
 enviable hostility to the inestimable breed of Morgans. I 
 stata, and can prove, that the horse called and known as 
 Old Sherman Morgan, covered the mare which produced 
 Black Hawk about eleven months previous to his being 
 foaled, and I do not believe any other horse covered her the 
 season he was begotten ; and when Black Hawk was nine 
 days old, 'Morgan Cock-of-the-Roek' covered the dam, and 
 she produced a foal the next year by said horse. I received 
 $15 for service of Old Sherman, for service rendered in 1832, 
 and $10 for service of 'Rock' in 1833, as, appears by my 
 books of those years. 

"Distinguished animals, like distinguished men, have 
 their calumniators, and the story to which you allude is 
 false, and originated from malignant hostility, rather than 
 good will to the breeders of horses. Very respectfully, 

"JOHN BELLOWS." 

The story which Mr. Bellows thus pronounces "false," 
 was that which represents "Paddy" as the sire .of Black 
 Hawk. 

Mr. Thurston, in connection with another person, bought 
 Black Hawk of A. R. Mathes. This gave rise to the erro- 
 neous idea which found its way into print, that Mr. Mathes, 
 (or Matthews as the name was printed) was the breeder of 
 the horse. Wo learned in a personal interview with Mr. 
 Mathes (now of this city), that he purchased Black Hawk of
