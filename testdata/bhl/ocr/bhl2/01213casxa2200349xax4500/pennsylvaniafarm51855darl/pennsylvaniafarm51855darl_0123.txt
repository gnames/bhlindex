a nephew of Ezekiel Twombly— the latter having died 
 shortly previous. He states that he bought him as a "Sher- 
 man Morgan colt," and heard nothing to the contrary till 
 long afterwards. He stated, also, that Benjamin Kelly, of 
 Durham, N. H., owned the dam of Black Hawk at the time 
 he was begotten, and that Mr. Kelly sold her to Mr. Twom- 
 bly after she was got in foal by Sherman Morgan— Mr. K. 
 being obligated to pay for the service of the horse. At our 
 solicitation Mr. Mathes wrote to Mr. Kelly on the subject, 
 and received a reply, dated December 21, 1854, from which 
 we take the following: 

"In the spring of 1832, Mr. Bellows came to my house 
 with the old Sherman Morgan, and stopped there one day 
 and night in each week, from May 8th to July 31st. While 
 at my stable, the old Morgan was put to the black mare, the 
 mother of Black Hawk. A few weeks before she foaled, I 
 sold the mare to Ezekiel Twombly, of Durham. The colt 
 you bought, and sold to Brown & Thurston. Mr. Bellows 
 called on mo for the pay for the service of the horse. In 
 1833, July 26th, I paid him $15, and took his receipt for the 
 use of said horse ; the same I charged to Twombly, for when 
 I let him have the mare, he agreed to pay for the use of the 
 horse. I am. certain that no other horse was put to the 
 mare while I had her." 

The foregoing documents need no explanation, or comment 
 Their explicitness leaves not a loop on which to hang a doubt 
 respecting the sire of Black Hawk. The general spread of 
 his progeny over the country, and the high estimation in 
 which it is everywhere held, is a sufficient excuse, in con- 
 nection with the circumstances before spoken of, for devo- 
 ting the space we have to this subject. 

We saw Black Hawk a few weeks since, a£ the stable of his 
 owner, David Hill, Esq., Bridport, Vt. The old horse is in 
 good health, and scarcely touched by the frost of age. The 
 charge for his service is fixed at $100 a mare for the season, 
 and Mr. Hill informed us that about thirty mares were al- 
 ready on his book for 1855.

Meeting, of the Philadelphia Society for Promoting

Philadelphia Society for promoting Agriculture. Stated 
 meeting at Hall, S. Third St., Wednesday morning, 7th inst. 

Mr. Landreth, President in the chair. After the reading 
 of the minutes the following gentlemen previously proposed 
 were elected members, viz., Messrs. Wm. Hacker, and J . T. 
 Balderston of Philadelphia, and Mr. A. Ter Hofen of 
 Frankford. 

Three propositions for resident members were received. 
 The Secretary reported having sent to additional kindred 
 Societies, copies of the published minutes of the Society. 
 Letters acknowledging the receipts of copies were read from 
 Mr. John Jay, President of Bedford Farmers' Club, West 
 Chester Co. N. 'Y., and from General J. T. Worthington, 
 Pres. of Ohio State Board of Agriculture, Chillicothe, Ohio. 
 Copies of the proceedings of the Ohio State Board and of 
 the Penn. State Agricultural Society received in exchange, 
 were presented. 

The Executive Committee recommended that action on 
 the question of holding an exhibition next autumn be post- 
 poned until next meeting. 

Mr. A. J. Roberts in behalf of the Committee on annual 
 appropriation, reported that the old county appropriation 
 would be continued this year by the present city government. 

Dr. A. L. Kennedy from the delegation of the U. States 
 Agricultural Society, reported the proceedings of that body 
 at its late session in Washington ; neither the time nor 
 place of holding the annual exhibition of that Society had 
 been determined; the question has been left with the Pres- 
 ident and Executive Cemmittee. 

Mr. Isaac Newton offered a Resolution appointing a com- 

mittee to confer with the President of the United States 
 Society on the propriety of their next Exhibition being held 
 in Philadelphia, — which, after discussion by Messrs. Rob- 
 erts, Elwyn, Biddle, Spangler, Newton, Willitts and Ingersoll 
 was amended by Mr. Roberts and passed finally in the fol- 
 owing form. 

Resolved, by the Philadelphia Society for promoting 
 Agriculture, that in their opinion an Exhibition by the U. 
 S. Agri. Society might be advantageously held at Philadel- 
 phia; and that a committee of three be appointed to confer 
 with the President of the U. S. Agri. Society, and the Ex- 
 ecutive Committee of the State Society, on the subject. 

On motion that the President be Chairman of the Com- 
 mittee and that he appoint his colleagues, which was so 
 ordered. The committee consists of Messrs. Landreth, Bid 
 die and Newton. 

H. Ingersoll Esq. called up his resolution proposed at 
 preceding meeting to strike out nineteenth By-Law, which 
 now renders the President ineligible for more than two 
 years, which resolution after much discussion was lost. 

S. H. Austin Esq., called attention to a tract of two hun- 
 dred acres above Germantown, which has been purchased 
 by a number of gentlemen with the intention of building 
 a large Hotel thereon. He believed that this Society would 
 find it advantageous to hold their annual Exhibitions there 
 in future, and doubted not that highly favorable terms might 
 be made with the proprietors. — whereupon 

Dr. J. A. M' Crea moved that a Committee of three be 
 appointed to examine the above ground, the terms on which 
 it can be used &c, and report at next meeting, which was 
 carried, and Messrs. M'Crea, Blight and Sheridan were ap- 
 pointed the Committee. 

The Chair introduced to the meeting Dr. John A. War- 
 der of Cincinnati, who delivered, a brief and interesting 
 address on the subject of hedges. He confined himself to 
 the Madura or Osage Orange, a plant which he deemed es- 
 pecially adapted to the purposes of hedging in this country. 
 The subject was one of immense importance, especially to 
 the West, where timber is scarce and land cheap, and where 
 thousands of miles of these hedges were being set. For land 
 worth more than a hundred dollars per acre, and in fields 
 of less than twenty acres, hedges were not to be recommen- 
 ded. Hedge planting in America has been a series of fail- 
 ures; not, he contended on account of the climate, for the 
 Madura was indigenous to this country, but from injurious 
 planting and treatment ; planting too close, too near to a 
 dead fence, want of cultivation and of sufficiently severe 
 pruning. These were the causes of failures, and his method 
 was designed to avoid them. He subsoiled and planted one 
 foot apart. The following spring he cut off all the vertical 
 branches three inches from the ground, barely trimming tho 
 lateral ones at their ends; the next year he repeated the 
 cutting at the same height ; the following year he cut again 
 but at the height of six inches. By this method he obtained 
 a perfect mat of branches near the ground, where they were 
 needed, five feet across and about twenty inches high, which 
 formed a complete protection in itself. Less trimming would 
 be required during -the succeeding years, but bold cutting 
 as above must be resorted to, if an impenetrable thicket 
 close to the ground would be secured. Frequently hedges 
 were found as it were upside down, thick and bushy above, 
 but wide gaps below through which a hog might creep, the 
 branches having disappeared. The Madura was of easy 
 propagation and rapid growth. It did not sucker and could 
 be plowed as near as you could coax your horses. The ver- 
 tical shoots would run up the first year to a height of from 
 four to ten feet. The plan of wattling or interweaving the 
 branches in order to produce an impenetrable wall and save
