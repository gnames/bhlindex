ground has been tried. This had been attempted four 
 years ago at the Cincinnati Cemetery, and had not succeed- 
 ed. He could now get his leg through and the hedge was 
 growing worse. The Madura hedge treated as he proposed 
 is a graud thing for Rail Roads, and could be set and kept 
 trimmed for three years at about seventy-five cents a rod ; 
 the R. R.company paying for the plowing. 

The Chair stated that an Osage Orange troe planted in 
 the vicinity of the city by his father thirty years ago was 
 still growing luxuriantly. He doubted if the plants were 
 trimmed as proposed that they would live that long. 

Dr Kennedy called attention to some beautiful and exact 
 engravings of insects injurious to vegetation, made by Mr. 
 R. D. Glover, now of Washington city. 

Dr. Elwyn requested members to examine some faithful 
 oil paintings of Horses and Cattle from life by Mr. Clarkson, 
 an excellent artist in that line in this city. These pain- 
 tings have been sent to the room for inspection. Adjourned. 

Living in the Country. 

"We have had an invitation to a party," said Mrs Spar- 
 rowgrass, "on Friday next, and I think a party is a very 
 pleasant thing in the country. There is more sociability, 
 more hospitality, warmer welcomes, less dress, and less style 
 than there is in the city." Here Mrs. Sparrowgrass handed 
 me an engraved card of rather formidable dimensions, which 
 I must confess looked any thing but rural. I took the mis- 
 sive with some misgivings, for I have a natural horror of 
 parties. "I wonder," said I, in the most playful kind of 
 bitter irony, "whether we will meet out here that young lady 
 that never sings herself, but is always so passionately fond 
 of music?" Mrs. Sparrowgrass said she thought not; she 
 said she heard she was married. 

"And that gentleman," I continued, "who was a stranger 
 tome, that always wanted to be presented to some young 
 lady that I didn't know ?" 

Mrs. Sparrowgrass said she believed he had gone to Cal- 
 ifornia. 

"And that lady who prized confectionery above good 
 breeding, and went home with her pockets well stuffed with 
 mottoes, in defiance of the eighth commandment, and the 
 laws of propriety?" 

Mrs. Sparrowgrass said she knew the lady to whom I al- 
 luded, but she assured me she was yet in New York, and 
 had not been seen about our village. 

"Then," said I, "Mrs. Sparrowgrass, we will go to the 
 party. Put my best shirt, and the white waistcoat in Mon- 
 day's wash. Never mind expense. Get me a crumb of 
 bread, and bring me my old white gloves. I am going to 
 bo gay," 

"I think," said Mrs. Sparrowgrass, "that a party in town 
 is nothing but an embarrassment." "True" said I. "Don't 
 you remember," said she, "what a fuss I used to make about 
 getting my hair fixed, and how put out I was that night 
 when you forgot the Japonica?" "Certainly." "And then, 
 when we were all dressed and ready, how we used to wait 
 for fear of getting there too early, and after we did reach 
 the house, how we always got in a corner, and made happy 
 wall-flowers of ourselves, and some old friend." "Of course 
 I do." "Where nobody took any notice of us." "Exactly." 
 "Then what difference did it make how I was dressed — 
 whether I wore Honiton lace or cotton edging ?" 

"I am afraid," said I, Mrs. Sparrowgrass, if you had made 
 a point of wearing cotton lace, you would not have been 
 invited." At this palpable douhle entendre I felt that secret 
 satisfaction which every man must feel when he has said a 
 good thing. It was lost upon Mrs. Sparrowgrass. "Here," 
 she continued, "we expect a simple, old-fashioned entertain- 

ment. Then I chimed in — "No gas-lights to make your eyes 
 ache — no patent-leather to make your feet ache — no fash- 
 ionable follies to make your heart ache — and no overheated, 
 ill ventilated rooms, boned-turkies, game, ice-cream, Char- 
 lotte Busse, pates, champaigne, and chicken-salad, to make 
 your head ache next morning." "There will be oysters and 
 ice-cream," said Mrs. Sparrowgrass, dubiously. "I wish," 
 said I, "there was a prospect of apples and cider instead. 
 The moment I get inside the doors, and breathe the mingled 
 odors of oysters and geraniums, it will carry me back to 
 town, and for one evening, at least, I shall forget that we 
 are living in the country. -" 

' I could be content 

To see no other verdure than its own; 
 To feel no other breezes than are blown 
 Through its tall woods;' 
 but we must succumb; we will go like plain, sensible peo- 
 ple, won't we?" 

"If you were mo, what would you wear?" said Mrs. 
 Sparrowgrass. 

"Something very plain, my dear." 

"Then," said Mrs. Sparrowgrass, "I have nothing very 
 plain, suitable for a party, and to-morrow I must go to town 
 and do a little shopping." 

"I am afraid," said I, (after the second day's bard shop- 
 ping in town) "your dress is going to be too plain, my dear. 
 Every hour brings a fresh boy, with a fresh bundle, and bill 
 to my office." Mrs. Sparrowgrass said, "that if I thought 
 so, perhaps she had better get something expensive when 
 she went to buy the trimming," I told her I thought her 
 dress would do without trimming. She said, "it would be 
 ridiculous without gimp or galloon ; but perhaps I would 
 prefer velvet ribbon, on account of the flounces !" I told 
 her she had better get the velvet ribbon, and omit the gimp 
 and galloon. Mrs. Sparrowgrass said "very well," and the 
 next day another boy brought another bundle, and another 
 bill, which convinced me that extras form an important item 
 in rural architecture. Then we had a dressmaker for several 
 days, and the stitching went on by sun-light and Lamp-light, 
 and on the last day Mrs. S. discovered she had nothing for 
 her head, and tho new bonnet was taken to pieces to get at 
 the feathers for a coiffure. Then when the night fell, there 
 was too a soaking rain ; and I had forgotten the carriage, so 
 I was obliged to go a mile in the mud to order one from the 
 village livery stable. Then I had to walk back, as the man 
 said "it was out;" but he promised to send it for us right 
 straight off. Then I had to dress over again. Then Mrs. S. 
 could not find her best handkerchief, and I dropped five 
 spermaceti blotches on the new silk dress looking for it. 
 Then she found the handkerchief. Then our girl said that 
 the new dog had run off with one of my boots. Then I had 
 to go out in the mud in my slippers after the dog. Then I 
 got the boot and put it on so as to make that sure. Then 
 we waited for the carriage. We were all dressed and ready, 
 but no carriage. We exercised all the patience we could 
 muster, on account of the carriage, and listened at the win- 
 dows to see if we could hear it. Two months have elapsed, 
 and it hasn't come yet. Next day we heard that the party 
 had been an elegant affair. That everybody was there, so 
 that we concluded the carriage had not been able to come 
 on account of business. 

I have bought me another dog. I bought him on account 
 of fine long ears, and beautiful silky tail. He is a pup, and 
 much caressed by the young ones. One day he went off 
 to the butcher's, and came back with no more tail than a 
 toad. The whole bunch of young Sparrowgrasses, when he 
 reached the cottage, began to bawl on account of his tail. 
 I did not know him when I came home, and he could not 
 recognize me' — he had lost his organ of recognition. He
