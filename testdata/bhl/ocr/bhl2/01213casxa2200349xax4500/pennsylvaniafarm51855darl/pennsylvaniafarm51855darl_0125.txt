reminded me of a dog I once heard of, that looked as if he 
 had been where they wanted a tail merely, and had taken 
 his, and thrown the dog away. Of course I took my stick, 
 and went to see the butcher. Butcher said "he supposed I 
 was something of a dog fancier, and would like to see my 
 dog look stylish." I said on the contrary, I had bought him 
 on account of his handsome silky tail, and that I would give 
 ten dollars to have it replaced. Then the idea of having it 
 replaced seemed so ludicrous that I could not restrain a 
 smile, and then the butcher caught the joke, and said there 
 was no way to do it except with fresh putty. I do love a 
 man that can enjoy a joke, so I took a fancy to that butcher. 
 When I got home and saw the dog, I thought less of the 
 butcher, but put a piece of black court-plaster on the dog, 
 and it improved his appearance at once. So I forgave the 
 butcher, and went to bed at peace with all mankind. 

Our neighbor has been making an improvement in his 
 house. He has had a drain made in the kitchen, with a 
 long earthen pipe ending in a cess-pool at the end of his 
 garden. The object of it is to carry off the superfluous 
 water from the house. It was a great convenience, he said, 
 "on wash days." One objection might be urged, and that 
 was after every heavy rain he found a gully in his garden 
 path, and several cart-loads of gravel in his cess-pool. Be- 
 sides, the pipe was of an equal width, and one obstruction 
 led to another ; sometimes it was a silver spoon or a child's 
 frock ; sometimes it was a scrubbing-brush, a piece of soap, 
 and a handkerchief. I said that if he had made a square 
 wooden trough, gradually widening from end to end, it 
 would have cleared itself, and then I thought it would bo a 
 good thing for me to have such a one myself. Then I had 
 a cess-pool built at the bottom of the wall, under the bank, 
 which is about one hundred and fifty feet from the kitchen, 
 and told my carpenter to make a trough of that length. 
 Carpenter asked me "how big I wanted it?" I told him 
 about eight inches in diameter at the end nearest to the 
 house, and then gradually widening all the way for the 
 whole length. As I said this, my carpenter smiled, and said 
 he never heard of such a thing. I told him no, that the 
 idea was an original one of my own. He asked me how 
 much I would like to have it widened. I replied, "about 
 half an inch to a foot." He said very well, and the next 
 week he came with two horses and an edifice in his cart that 
 looked like a truncated shot tower. I asked him what that 
 was? He said it was the big end of my pipe. When he 
 laid it on its side, I walked through it, and could not touch 
 the upper side with my hand. I asked the carpenter what 
 he meant by it, he said it was made according to directions. 
 I said not at all, that I told him to increase the diameter at 
 the rate of half an inch to the foot, and he had made it 
 about a foot to the foot, as near as I could judge. "Sparrow- 
 grass," said he, a little nettled, "jest take your pencil and 
 put down eight inches." "Well that is the diameter of the 
 small end, I believe?" I told the carpenter he was right so 
 far. Now for every foot there is an increase of half an inch 
 in the width ; that's according to directions, too, aint it ? 
 Yes. "Well, then, put down one hundred and fifty half in- 
 ches, how much does that make, altogether, in feet?" Six 
 feet eleven inches." Now," said he, "jest you take my 
 rule, and measure the big end of that ere pipe." "Carpen- 
 ter," said I, "I see it all, but the next time I build an aque- 
 duct I will be a little more careful in the figures." "Sparrow- 
 grass," said he, pointing to the pipe, "did not you tell me 
 that was an original idea of your own?" I answered that 
 I believed I did make a remark of that kind. "Well," said 
 he, with a sort of muffled laugh, "that is the first time that 
 I did see an original idea come out at the big end." 

Report on some of the Diseases and Insects Affecting 

Fruit Trees and Vines.

Swollen Branches of the Apple Tree. — On the 31st 
 of May, the Hon. M. P. Wilder, sent to me some pieces of 
 the limbs of an apple tree, which were singularly enlarged 
 in diameter to the extent of several inches. He found the 
 disease to prevail on the north side of the tree, while the 
 south side was almost entirely free from it. The specimens 
 were carefully examined by Prof. Asa Gray and myself, 
 without insects, their punctufes, or their tracks being found 
 therein. One of the branches, measuring two and a half 
 inches in circumference immediately below the swollen part, 
 was enlarged above this spot to four inches in circumfer- 
 ence, and the enlarged portion was eleven inches in length. 
 The outer bark seemed perfectly healthy, When sawn trans- 
 versely, the pith was not found in the centre of the piece, 
 but nearer to one side than the other, where the layers of 
 wood were thicker, and looser in texture. It was also evi- 
 dent that the thickpr layers followed a spiral direction a- 
 round the limb. When the bark was raised, the wood pre- 
 sented a singularly irregular surface, caused by numerous 
 depressions and furrows, which were filled by corresponding 
 elevations of the inner bark. The disease was evidently a 
 diseased formation and irregular deposit of woody matter. 
 It belongs to the province of the vegetable physiologist to 
 explain the cause of this preternatural and diseased forma- 
 tion. 

Warts or Excrescences on Plum Trees. — These havo 
 been attributed by many persons to the punctures or to the 
 presence of insects therein. I have not been able to find 
 either the one or the other in the incipien : warts or in their 
 immediate vicinity. Itwas only when these excrescences were 
 well grown and were approaching to maturity, that insects 
 were discovered in them, and not always even in this stage. 
 Some of the twigs, containing incipient warts, were enclosed 
 in a tight vessel in May, and were examined in August, 
 when they were entirely free from the vestiges of insects, 
 although the tumors when cut open, presented the porous 
 and cancellated structure peculiar to them when dry. The 
 insects to be found in the warts in the course of the summer 
 are of sundry kinds ; such as the grubs of the plum-weevil, 
 borers similar to those that attack peach and cherry trees, 
 and the worm-like caterpillars of minute moths. The last 
 seem to be the most abundant and the most common. Their 
 presence is made known by the castings or grain-like frag- 
 ments thrown out of their burrows upon the surface of .the 
 warts. These tumors also afford nourishment to certain 
 vegetable parasites, the little black grains, half immersed 
 in the surface, to which, when mature, they give a deep 
 black color. These little grains are fungi, which have been 
 described under the name of Spharia morbosa. But neither 
 to them, nor to various insects before named, is the origin 
 of the warts to be ascribed. The incipient warts can be 
 detected, before the outer bark is ruptured, by the swollen 
 appearance aud spongy feeling of the surface. They seem 
 to be the result of diseased action in the inner bark and new 
 wood, while these parts are in a state of rapid formation. 
 Upon examination, the cells of the tissues are found to be 
 surcharged with fluid, and distorted in shape and arrange- 
 ment. The plum tree has been called a gross feeder. It 
 may imbibe fluids by its roots faster than it can exhale the 
 superfluous moisture from its leaves; or the function of the 
 latter may be checked by such sudden changes in tempera- 
 ture and in the hygrometric state of the atmosphere as are 
 common in the spring. In either case, there would be likely 
 to ensue an accumulation of fluid in the branches, and par-
