One case containing a variety of plants collected in 
 Japan and in the island of the Great Loo Choo; also one 
 large Loo Choo plant not in case, and four tubs of water 
 lily. 

Two cases, one of sugar cane from Java, and the other 
 of exotic plants from St. Helena, collected by Dr. James 
 Morrow, agriculturist to the Japan expedition. 

The plants were gathered under the direction of Com- 
 modore Perry. They are in pretty good condition. A 
 few of them withered and died on their passage home. 

Captain Glasson also brought home with him a real 
 live Chinese from Hong Kong. He is a florist and gar- 
 dener, and goes to Washington, to attend to the plants. 
 He is about twenty years of age, and named Oqui. He 
 speaks English a little, which he leai-ned on the voyage, 
 and says he is now an American. He was born at Can- 
 ton, and is tolerably good looking. 

from Rome, the country seat of the Pope, where this 
 fruit has long been cultivated. This variety is stated to 
 have' been brought hither from that part of Armenia 
 which borders cm Persia, where it grows in the greatest 
 perfection and abundance. The flesh of this melon when 
 i fully matured, is delicious, and may be eaten with safety 
 without injury to the dyspeptic or those of the weakest 
 stomachs. The form of cantaleups is generally roundish 
 with a rough, warty, or netted outer rind, or skin. The 
 size of the plant is rather small, and the flesh, for the 
 most part of a yellowish color, though with some it is 
 green. â€” Patent Office Report. 

The History of the Melon. 

The history of the watermelon, so much esteemed for 
 its delicious, and cooling juice, as well as that of the 
 muskmelon or cantaleup, which is equally prized for its 
 rich aromatic pulp, may be traced back to remote anti- 
 quity. The former, which is generally considered as the 
 melon of the Jews, mentioned in various places in the 
 Bible, is believed to have originated in Egypt, or South- 
 ern India, where it has been cultivated from time immem- 
 orial. It would appear that it was unknown to the 
 ancient Greeks and Romans, as no definite information 
 respecting it can be gleaned from their authors. The 
 muskmelon, which is represented to have been a native 
 of Asia, was known to the Greek and Roman physicians, 
 and its properties and uses described by them at length. 

The kind of muskmelon most esteemed among ama- 
 teurs in various parts of Europe, and described, is the 
 "Cantaleup," so called from a place about fourteen miles 

Wheat Midge. 

The following account of this fly is abridged from the 
 second edition of Dr. Harris' treatise on insects: 

It is a very small, orange-colored gnat, with long, 
 slender, pale-yellow legs, and two transparent wings, re- 
 flecting the tints of the rainbow, and fringed with deli- 
 cate hairs. Its eyes are black and prominent. Its faco 
 and feelers are yellow. Its antennce are long and black- 
 ish. These insects vary much in size. The largest fe- 
 males do not exceed one-tenth of an inch in length ; and 
 many are found, towards the end of the season, less 
 than half this length. The males are usually rather 
 smaller than the females, and somewhat paler in color. 

The time of their appearance in the winged form, va- 
 ries according to the season and the situation, from tho 
 beginning of June to the end of August. In most parts 
 of New England, where wheat is cultivated, immense 
 swarms of these oronge-colored gnats infest fields of 
 grain towards the last of June. While the sun shines, 
 they conceal themselves among the leaves and weeds 
 near the ground. They take wing during the morning 
 and evening twilight, and also in cloudy weather, when 
 they lay their eggs in the opening flowers of the grain. 
 New swarms continue to come forth in succession, till 
 the end of July; but the principal deposit of eggs is 
 made in the first half of July, when late sown winter 
 wheat and early sown spring wheat are in the blossom 
 or milk. The flies are not confined to wheat alone, but 
 deposit in barley, rye, and oats, when these plants aro 
 in flower at the time of their appearance. I have found 
 the maggots within the seed-scales of grass, growing 
 near to wheat fields. 

The eggs hatch in about eight days after they are 
 laid, when the little yellow maggots or grain-worms may 
 be found within the chaffy scales of the grain. Being 
 hatched at various times during a period of four or five 
 weeks, they do not all arrive at maturity together. Mrs. 
 Gage informs me that they appear to come to their 
 growth in twelve or fourteen days. They do not ex- 
 ceed one-eighth of an inch in length, and many, even, 
 when fully grown, are much smaller. From two to fif- 
 teen or twenty have been found within the husk of a 
 single grain, and sometimes in every husk in the ear. 
 In warm and sheltered situations, and in parts of fields 
 protected from the wind by fences, buildings, trees or 
 bushes, the insects are said to be much more numerous 
 than in fields upon high ground or other exposed places, 
 where the grain is kept in constant motion by the wind. 
 Grain is commonly more infested by them during the 
 second than the first year, when grown on the same
