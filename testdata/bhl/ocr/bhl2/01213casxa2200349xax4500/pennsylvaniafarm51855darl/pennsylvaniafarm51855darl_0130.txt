THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[April 

ground two years in succession ; and it suffers more in 
 the immediate vicinity of old fields, than in places more 
 remote. These insects prey on the wheat in the milky state 
 and their ravages cease when the grain becomes hard. 
 They do not burrow •within the kernels, but live on the 
 pollen and on the soft matter of the grain, which they 
 probably extract from the base of the germs. It ap- 
 pears, from various statements, that very early and very 
 late wheat escape with comparatively little injury. 
 The amount of which, in other cases, depends upon the 
 condition of the grain at the time when the maggots are 
 batched. When the maggots begin their depredations 
 soon after the blossoming of the grain, they do the 
 greatest injury; for the kernels never fill out at all. 
 Pinched or partly filled kernels are the consequence of 
 their attacks when the grain is more advanced. The 
 bulls of the impoverished kernels will always be found 
 split open on the convex side, so as to expose the em- 
 bryo. This is caused by the drying and shrinking of 
 the hull, after a portion of the contents thereof has been 
 sucked out by the maggots. 

Towards the end of July, the full-grown maggots 
 leave off eating, and become sluggish and torpid, pre- 
 paratory to moulting their skins. The torpid state lasts 
 only a few days, after which the insect casts off its skin, 
 leaving the latter entire, except a little rent in one end 
 of it. Sometimes the maggots descend from the plants, 
 and moult on the surface of the ground, where they 
 leave their cast skins. Late broods are sometimes har- 
 vested with the grain, and carried into the barn without 
 having moulted. [The seasons in New England are 
 about three weeks later than in this latitude. — Ed.] 

After shedding its skin, the maggot recovers its activ- 
 ity, and writhes about as at first, but takes no food. It 
 is shorter, somewhat flattened, and more obtuse than 
 before, and is of a deeper yellow color, with an oblong 
 greenish spot in the middle of the body. Within two or 
 three days after moulting, the maggots either descend 
 of their own accord, or are shaken out of the ears by 
 the wind, and fall to the ground. They do not let them- 
 selves down by threads, for they are not able to spin. 
 Nearly all of them disappear before the middle of Au- 
 gust; and they are very rarely found in the grain at the 
 time of harvest. [New England, not Pennsylvania. Ed.] 

Having reached the ground, the maggots soon burrow 
 under the surface, sometimes to the depth of about an 
 inch, those of them that have not already moulted cast- 
 ing their skins before entering the earth. Here they 
 remain, without further change, through the following 
 winter. During the month of May, I have seen speci- 
 mens still in the larva form in the earth wherein they 
 had been kept during the winter. It is not usually till 
 June that they are transformed to pupaj. This change 
 is effected without another moulting of the skin; not the 
 slightest vestige of the larva skin being found in the 
 earth in which some of these insects had undergone 
 their transformations. Moreover, the pupa is entirely 
 naked, not being enclosed either in a cocoon or in the 
 puparium formed of this outer skin of the larva, and it 
 has its limbs and wings free or unconfined. The pupa 
 6tate lasts but a short time, a week or two at most, and 
 probably, in many cases, only a few days. Under the 
 most favorable circumstances, the pupa works its way to 

the surface, before liberating the included fly: and when 
 the insect has taken wing, its empty pupa skin will be 
 seen sticking out of the ground. In other cases, the fly 
 issues from its pupa skin in the earth, and comes to the 
 surface with flabby wings, which soon expand and dry 
 on exposure to the air. This last change occurs mostly 
 during the months of June and July, when great num- 
 bers of the flies have been seen, apparently coming from 
 the ground, in fields where grain was raised the year 
 before. 

The Remedies, or means of preventing the ravages of 
 this insect, are very similar to those recommended for the 
 Hessian fly, — there is no hope that a specific will be 
 found for either. 

Smoking them out of a field, by means of smouldering 
 fires kept burning on the windwaixl side, has been re- 
 commended, but we have never heard of its being tried, 
 and never expect to, more than once ; the same may be 
 said of fumigating the crop with sulphur, and dusting it 
 with lime, — the last has been tried, and found of no avail 
 whatever. 

Catching the flies, with a long net or seine, made of 
 ropes and fine gauze, was gravely recommended by Dr. 
 Fitch, as the plan he proposed to employ on the next 
 visitation of the insects in his vicinity; and, said he, "I 
 shall be much disappointed, if countless millions are not 
 gathered into the net." This was written ten years ago, 
 and we have not yet seen any report of the Doctor's 
 success at wholesale fly catching. We presume that if 
 "countless millions" were caught in his net, there were 
 as many billions that escaped ! 

Parasites are said to destroy a considerable portion of 
 the yellow worms or maggots, but we think that the pro- 
 portion killed in this way is much less than of the Hes- 
 sian fly. Birds, we have no doubt, consume a much 
 larger number, as these little friends of the farmer may 
 be seen busily at work all day long, picking the larvae 
 out of the wheat heads, where the crop is most affected. 

Starving the insects, by omitting to sow wheat in a 
 given district for one or two seasons, has been recom- 
 mended as a certain remedy ; but it is difficult of prac- 
 tice, as it would be necessary for the farmers of quite a 
 large district to combine for this purpose, and consent 
 to purchase their wheat or flour for a year or two, which 
 many will not willingly do. 

Early solving and good culture, so as to secure the 
 maturity of the grain before the worms have hatched, 
 or become ' old enough to injure it, is the surest of all 
 methods, we believe, and the most easily practiced. 
 Wet and cold clayey lands are especially favorable to 
 the ravages of this insect; hence we have a new argu- 
 ment in favor of thorough draining and deep plowing. 

In some of the more northern States, very late sowing 
 and the use of spring wheat has been found advanta* 
 geous, as the crop is thereby prevented from blossoming 
 until after the time for the insect to deposit its eggs baa 
 passed. 

The Peach Crop. 
 The Pomologists of the east, as is well known, assert 
 that a temperature of from fifteen to twenty degrees be- 
 low zero destroys the vitality of the fruit bud in the 
 peach and other trees, and it is feared the recent ex-
