C. P. Holcomb's Devons. 

The opposite engravings by Clarkson, represent por- 
 traits of a superior Devon Bull and lieifer, from a late 
 importation, owned by C. P. Holeomb, near New Castle, 
 Delaware. While his reputation as a skilful and suc- 
 cessful farmer, is coextensive with the country, his large 
 and beautiful herd of Devons, to which breed in the 
 commencement of his career as a farmer his attention 
 was first drawn, have attracted visitors and purchasers 
 from every section of the Union. 

Those of our readers who have been in the habit of 
 attending agricultural exhibitions in this, and the ad- 
 joining states of Delaware and Maryland, are familiar 
 with Mr. Holcomb's Devons. We believe they have 
 never missed taking premiums- Each breed of cattle, 
 Durham, Devon, Alderney, &c, have their particular 
 excellencies for different locations, and purposes, as well 
 as their warm advocates. 

While neither does, nor can, combine every advantage 
 that may be wished for, they each have peculiar merits, 
 and which differ so much that no comparison can fairly 
 be made. 

The Devons are proverbial for hardiness, and as oxen, 
 are entirely unrivalled. Good working oxen are very 
 much in demand, and are selling at high prices the pres- 
 ent se-ason. We have known within a few days, a pair 
 to sell for $200, and $150 to $175 has not been uncom- 
 mon. This is probably one reason why Devons are now 
 attracting so much inquiry and attention. They are a 
 beautiful and valuable breed. We should be pleased to 
 hear from our friend Holeomb as to the milking quali- 
 ties of his cows. 

The following is the pedigree of Plowboy and Cherry. 

Ploughboy, was calved June, 1850; sire Springfield; 
 grand sire, imported Eclipse, (191); dam Edith, (679.) 
 Ploughboy took the first prize at the Maryland Show, 
 1854. 

Cherry, calved May, 1849 ; sire, Springfield, bred by 
 George Patterson, Esq. ; grand sire, Eclipse ; dam 
 Beauty by Granby — took the first prize at the Maryland 
 Show 1853. 

Work for the Month. 

Farm. — Owing to the backwardness of the spring, 
 much of the labor usually performed in March has been 
 necessarily postponed to April. Oats should be sown 
 as soon as the ground will permit. Ground intended 
 for corn not already done, should be plowed and sub- 
 soiled as soon as possible, before it becomes dry and 
 hard. As fine pulverization is of great account, those 
 plows should be used which tend to this end. The 
 Michigan Double Plow is the best we have seen for this 
 purpose. 

Early Potatoes should be planted in a warm situation. 
 If a few rows be planted every week or two, a portion 
 of the crop is almost certain to "hit the season," and 
 yield well. Prepare the ground for root crops and for 
 sowing corn for fodder. 

Stock should now have particular attention instead of 
 being neglected as is too often the case. Ewes and 
 lambs should have a small quantity of grain and roots 
 daily, and should be allowed to run on high and dry 
 pasture land. Horses that have been standing idle sll 

winter, are liable to fall off in flesh at this season when 
 put to constant work, unless very well cared for. Have 
 salt in the reach of all animals, to lick at pleasure. 

Fruit Orchard; — Trees may still be planted this 
 month and in doing so, cut off all bruised and broken 
 roots ; make the cut from the lower part, so that 
 the cut surface may be down. Head in, by cutting off 
 the ends of branches of large trees. See that the 
 worm is not at work at Peach trees. If the earth was 
 removed from the body of the trees last fall, put a shov- 
 el full or two of wood ashes around each tree, and re- 
 turn the earth that was taken away. Quince trees 
 should be dug around and well manured ; salt scatter- 
 ed under them answers an excellent purpose in produ- 
 cing fair fruit. Gooseberries, currants and grape vines 
 two years old, from cuttings, should now be transplant- 
 ed in places ; in digging the holes, make them largo 
 and deep, filling in what was before occupied with sub- 
 soil with surface loam, leaving the subsoil on the top to 
 become improved by the contact of sun and air. These 
 should be heavily manured, as the gooseberry and cur- 
 rant are rank feeders. All transplanted trees should 
 be mulched by putting around the roots manure hay or 
 straw. Grafting apple and pear trees may still be con- 
 tinued till the leaves begin to expand, if the grafts were 
 cut in season and properly taken care of. Cherries, 
 plums and peaches should have been done last month. 
 Remove all insects from trees, and apply a wash of 
 equal parts soft soap and lye, and remember that trees 
 need cultivation. 

Vegetable Garden.-*— Finish planting out esculents 
 for seed, and at a distance from others of the same ge- 
 nus. All kinds of seeds may usually be planted this 
 month, reserving such as are tender of frost till the 
 last. Make plantations of asparagus. Plant out rhu- 
 barb, horse radish and onion setts. Sow peas, radishes, 
 and lettuce, every few days for a succession. Plant out 
 cabbages, cauliflower and lettuce from cold frames. 
 Plant Lima beans, cucumbers and melons in pots, under 
 frames or in inverted sods, to set out when the weather 
 is settled. Transplant medicinal herbs, and sow seeds 
 for more. Keep the ground hoed and stirred and free 
 from weeds. 

Flower Garden. — All such work as pimning roses, 
 and flowering shrubs, honeysuckles and creepers of all 
 kinds, laying sod, planting box edging, transplanting 
 herbaceous plants, manuring and digging the flower 
 beds, should be concluded this month. Continue to 
 plant evergreens, and all kinds of shrubbery. Wiegilia 
 Rosea, Forsythia Viridissima, Spirea Reevesii, and Pru- 
 nifolia, bloom before the earliest rose. If the weather 
 is suitable, flower seeds may be sown on a warm border 
 the latter part of the month. A good method to plant 
 them is to break the soil very fine, (if the soil is of a 
 clay nature, mix a little sand to loosen it, otherwise the 
 seeds will not be able to germinate,) then take a six 
 inch flower pot inverted, and press the soil, sow the 
 seed in the ring made by the flower pot. If the seed is 
 very fine, merely pressing it with the flower pot will be 
 found sufficient ; other kinds should have a little soil 
 strewed lightly over them. A good lesson is to be learn- 
 ed on this subject if we observe the successful germi- 
 nation of seeds dropped from the parent plant. Tulips,
