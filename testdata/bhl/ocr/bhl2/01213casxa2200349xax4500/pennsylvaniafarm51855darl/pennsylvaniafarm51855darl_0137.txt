fine symmetrical heads, not surpassed in this respect by 
 any others in the large collection. They bear fruit 
 abundantly every season. 

Oaks we all look upon as the pride of our American 
 forests, and they are so spoken of by foreigners. There 
 is a majesty and grandeur about a venerable oak, which 
 has had space to extend its massive branches, not 
 equalled by any other of our native trees, and which 
 may well be regarded with some national pride. They 
 are a fair rival to the old English elms, 60 prominent a 
 feature of their park scenery, about which they boast so 
 much and value like their patents of nobility. 

Oaks are well adapted for shade and ornament in the 
 landscape by their broad leaves, various hues, variety of 
 habit and mode of growth, and, so far as we know, are 
 yet free from insect ravages. Their hardiness is pro- 
 verbial, and we hope soon to see them more generally 
 planted. Among the different species, we would recom- 
 mend the macrocarpa, or mossy cup, desirable both for 
 its foliage and beautiful fruit, Coccinnea oscalet oak 
 very attractive for its deep crimson leaves in the fall, 
 Tirctoria or black oak, Falcata or Spanish oak, Nigra or 
 black Jack, and Alba or white oak. Q. nigra is of rath- 
 er slower growth than the others, but has very hsnd- 
 eome, large and thick, glossy leaves, five to eight inches 
 long, obscurely lobed. Quercus Phellos, or willow oak, 
 60 named from the peculiar conformation of the leaves, 
 is also a beautiful species ; and Quercus Palustris, gen- 
 erally found in wet places, but also grows finely on dry 
 eoil. It has long and often pendulous branches. Will 
 some of our readers sends us the measurement of any 
 unusually large oak trees in their respective neighbor- 
 hoods, in order to make a record of them in the Farm 
 Journal ? There is a white oak at Bartram's garden, 
 near Philadelphia, eighty feet high by thirteen feet in 
 circumference. What part of Pennsylvania can beat 
 this? 

What is the Matter? 

Mr. Batehan of the Ohio Cultivator, seems to have 
 but little love for the United States Agricultural Socie- 
 tp, if we may judge from the tone of an article in his 
 last number. Can it be that he has not yet forgiven 
 the Society for holding its exhibition at Springfield, and 
 overshadowing the Ohio Agricultural Society last season?

Mowing Machines and Lime Spreaders Again. ~ A Reply. 

Mr. J. L. Darlington:— I observe in the March num- 
 ber of the Farm Journal, an article on the above subject, 
 from your correspondent near Penningtonville, Pa. 

He appears to have had very bad luck in procuring ma- 
 chinos, or implements as he terms them ; and seems to cen- 
 eure the printers for publishing such "exaggerating ac- 
 counts of the wonderful performances of machines." 

As I know but little about his mowing machine, I will 
 not venture to say anything about it ; but have some know- 
 ledge of the Lime Spreaders "that are puffed and blowed 
 about as superior labor saving machines, and awarded pre- 
 miums by committees who never saw them perform." This 
 assertion, I beg leave with candor and respect to say, is 
 with but a single exception, not correct. As far as I am 
 concerned, in every instance save the one alluded to, I have 
 been at the expense of furnishing lime to try my ma- 
 chines in the presence of committees. 

As to our neighbor being induced to purchase one of 

those machines from seeing such "puffs and blows," pub' 
 lished in agricultural papers let us enquire: his place is 
 not over four miles from the shops whero those machines 
 are built, and he was a frequent visitor at the shop where 
 he purchased the machine, making every inquiry relative 
 to their performance, and was referred to his numerous 
 neighbors who had machines, and tried them successfully, 
 and gave certificates of satisfaction to the maker and inven- 
 tor, last spring. 

The correspondent got his machine in an unusually wet 
 season, and lime was generally like mortar. 

But suppose the weather had been dry and the lime in 
 fine order, would it have been any better in that case? I 
 doubt not, some men never can be suited, or if they are, 
 they either don't know it, or will not acknowledge it I 
 think this is the case with our neighbor. I think he never 
 had anything done right, or made to please him, even to a 
 wheelbarrow. 

I was cautioned before selling him a machine, that it 
 would do me more harm than good, and told that neither I 
 nor anybody else could please him. I confess I never sold 
 a machine with as much reluctance in my life, believing I 
 had been properly cautioned. I can at any time produce 
 certificates from at least fifty of your correspondent's neigh- 
 bors, that will testify their satisfaction in the operations of 
 the samo Lime Spreaders that he complains of; beside, I 
 can produce numerous letters from gentlemen at a distance 
 whom I never saw, giving, in glowing colors, their satis- 
 faction of the operation of my machines. 

Perhaps the following will bo sufficient for the present, 
 and although not written with the view of being published, 
 I will take, however, the responsibility of satisfying the 
 writer, if anything should be unpleasant to him in seeing 
 his letter and name in print LEWIS COOPER.

Dear Sir : — Tne only apology I have to make to you for 
 not writing ?ooner, is, that I have been up to my eyes in 
 lime for tb« last 12 months. The people in this neighbor- 
 hood saj I have the lime mania. I am only sorry your in- 
 ventive genius had not been at work 20 years ago, and I 
 had taken the lime mania at that time. In that case, my 
 estate at this time would have been worth four times as 
 much as it is now. I havo hauled four miles, 4250 bushels 
 of quick lime within the last 12 months, and expect to haul 
 and put on 5000 bushels this year. I am, in my 59th 
 year ; most of the lime I spread myself. I shall never stop 
 until I lime the last foot of land I own. I put from 25 to 
 30 bushels to the acre. If I live, I shall build a monu- 
 ment to perpetuate the memory of Lewis Cooper, for inven- 
 ing a machine to spread lime, and Thomas I. Marlow, for 
 having the industry to use it, and I shall only lay the foun- 
 dation 9 inches deep, so that those that come after us, will 
 see what useful men we were. I can spread with a yoke of 
 oxen about five acres a day, and with horses, 7 acres. The 
 guano spreader does very well. I spread last fall, six tons 
 of guano and four and a half tons of plaster, at the rate of 
 eight acres a day. It diffuses very well indeed, I would 
 not be without it I purpose sowing all my plaster with it 
 I think the advantage of properly diffusing the quantity I 
 use yearly, will pay for a machine in one season. 

Yours with respect, THOMAS I. MARLON. 

Allen's Mower, 
 We have on file a communication from Peter Dampman, 
 vindicating Allen's mower as made by Leo Pierce & Thomp- 
 son, against the charges of Mr Wood, but owing to the lato 
 period to was received we are compelled to postpone it
