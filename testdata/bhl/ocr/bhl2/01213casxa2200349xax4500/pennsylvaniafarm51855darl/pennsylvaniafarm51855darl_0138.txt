Soil Analysis. 
 To the Editor of the Farm Journal: — In the last 
 number of your Journal, I noticed the publication of a 
 letter to Mr. Holcomb, with reference to the annexed com- 
 munication that appeared recently in the Delaware Gazette. 
 I fear that this version of my letter will give offence to 
 both Prof. Henry and other gentlemen, unless the whole of 
 my letter is published; and as it is strictly agricultural in its 
 character, I hope you will not refuse k a place in your col- 
 umns. And allow me to add that both Delaware and Vir- 
 ginia are embraced in the Maryland Agricultural Society ; 
 therefore, being advised that the agricultural departments of 
 Colleges in both Maryland and Virginia would offer formulae, 
 I hoped that some of the alumni or faculty of the college 
 of my native state would aid in restoring soil analysis to 
 the Farmer — believing as I do, that the farmer should have 
 every encouragement to self dependence in this respect, as 
 he has in every other, and (if you will allow a play upon 
 words,) as pharmacy was the mother of general chemistry, 
 10 farmers may prove the parents of agricultural chemistry. 
 We talk about the science of Agricultural Chemistry, but 
 where is the sage who can, like the veteran apothecary, 
 Bouillon La Grange, point his pupils to the example of 
 Glauber, Kunkel. Charas, Lemerie, Rouclle, Macquer, Cadet, 
 Baume, Lavoisier, Priestley, Berthollet, Guyton, Fourcroy, 
 Chaptel, Pelletier, Vauquelin, Proust and a host of others. 
 It is gravely asserted in a late number of the Highland 
 (Scottish) Journal of Agri., that one year is required to per- 
 form the perfect analysis of twelve samples of soil; therefore 
 soil analysis must be pronounced forever beyond the reach 
 ©f the farmer for all practical purposes, as the expense is 
 beyond his means: — I may make the same remark with re- 
 gard to a perfect diagnosis of any disease, howover simple, 
 and say that it would require one month of my time to use 
 all the modern means of determining what the disease is, 
 and that it is better to make a perfect examination where 
 life is concerned, or to avoid medicine altogether. 

Prof. Henry acted wisely, at the time referred to. He was 
 more fully aware, than I, of the discredit into which all the 
 old systems of soil analysis had fallen ; but, anticipating 
 the discredit of all quantitative soil analysis, I requested my 
 formula to be deposited in the Smithsonian Institute, for a 
 few years. Mr. Booth's unanswerable denunciation of ul- 
 timate, or perfect soil analysis may have introduced the ap- 
 proximative, or qualitative mode by normal solutions into 
 Dr. Higgin's laboratory, but it was before that time repudi- 
 ated by his assistant, and the attempt at quantitative anal- 
 ysis preferred : as may be seen by referring to his reports 
 of 1853, as contrasted with 1854. 

Since that time, tho use of normal solutions, instead of 
 weights, has become popular in Europe, and now we may 
 expect that it will be viewed with favor by some learned 
 men in the United States — particularly, as tho merest tyro 
 in chemistry can now detect the presence of 25 pounds 
 of Phosphoric acid in an acre of soil, in a few hours — and 
 ono fact, with regard to one hundred soils, is of infinitely 
 more value, than one thousand facts with regard to one soil. 
 After many years experience in teaching alumni from 
 most of the colleges and universities in tho United States, 
 I may be allowed to expross tho opinion that, although far- 
 mers may spend three days of each week in attending in- 
 structions on Geology and general Chomistry, yet, without 
 abridging these, either in point of time or importance, a 
 few hours of each week should be awarded to tho most 
 successful student, in another department, applied Chem- 
 istry, to which, there should be no other door but merit, and 
 in which, there should be no claim for instruction, but suc- 
 cess. David Stewart, M. D., Baltimore, Feb. 22d, 1855. 

The following is the lotter published in the Delaware 
 Gazette, referred to in the above, — Ed. 

To C. P. Johnson : — My attention has been called to the 
 publication of a letter of mine in your issue of Friday, 17tb 
 ultimo, and I must beg you to allow me the privilege of ex- 
 plaining what I mean by certain opinions therein briefly 
 expressed, with which my good friend, Mr. Kennedy, is bet- 
 ter acquainted than those of your readers with whom I have 
 not had the pleasure of personal intercourse. 

First — "With regard to the general application of chomis- 
 try to agriculture, I have long since formed the opinion 
 that the matter was still in embryo; and that the attempts 
 to teach agricultural chemistry were generally attended with 
 more harm than benefit. On several occasions I have been 
 applied to by colleges and associations of intelligent agricul- 
 turists, in different parts of the United States, to name a 
 reliablo teacher in this department; and, when I have ex- 
 pressed the difficulty, as above, it has generally oceasioned 
 surprise that one who has spent nearly a quarter of a cen- 
 tury in the application of Chemistry — and especially to 
 analysis — should be so sceptical in relation to its application 
 to Agriculture. I could stato many reasons for theso opin- 
 ions, and must acknowledge that they appear to conflict with 
 my letter, above referred to, in the encouragement of soil • 
 analysis. 

Ibe late Geologist of Delaware, Mr. Booth, has adopted 
 these sentiments and expressed them publicly; but he had 
 gone too far, by deferring the matter until a more convenient 
 season, which can never arrive. Believing, as I do, that 
 what is certainly known on this subject is of immense value 
 to the farmers, and that this "budding science" is destined 
 to blossom and bear fruit, I have been for years attempting 
 to cultivate it, and prepare the ground for its reception ; but, 
 as I remarked in my letter, the next generation of Delawaro 
 farmers may be the soil on which it will unfold its treasures. 
 What we most want is reliablo statistics, carefully made up 
 in all parts of our extensive country. In order to facilitate 
 this — in one of the departments referred to— in the year 
 1850, 1 corresponded with Prof. Henry, of the Smithsonian 
 Institute, and endeavored to induce that Institute to offer a 
 premium for the best formula for soil analysis. At the samo 
 time, I placed in the Smithsonian Institute my formula, re- 
 fusing under any circumstances, to receive any compensation 
 or premium, should one bo offered, especially as it was my 
 suggestion. I endeavored to show the importance of statis- 
 tics in soil analysis, and that the first step to uniformity 
 should bo a National formula — revised every year, perhaps, 
 but still having ,a tendency to promote uniformity of prac- 
 tice, upon the same principle that we have a national Phar- 
 macopoeia and formula., that are quoted over the rrhole world 
 as tho United States' Formula. No one will for a moment 
 admit that there ever was, or could be, a de-nation in tho 
 combining proportions of Chlorine and Mercury, in the for- 
 mation of Calomel; yet every one will acknowledge that 
 Howard's Calomel is stronger than that made by the U. S. 
 formula; and, by the way, it was the decennial revision of 
 the U. S. Pharmacopoeia, in Washington, that suggested the 
 above idea to me, being Chairman of the Maryland delega- 
 tion in the National Convention, and appointed on the com- 
 mittee of revision. 

Now the very best evidence of the truth of my opinions 
 about the science of agricultural chemistry, is the answer of 
 Prof. Henry, that it would be impossible to get any three 
 chemists to unite in preferring any formula for soil analysis. 
 My formula was deposited in the Smithsonian Institute in 
 1850; in the constant use of it during the ensuing two years, 
 I made several improvements; and in the winter of 1852, 
 I demonstrated it to a number of intelligent gentlemen in my
