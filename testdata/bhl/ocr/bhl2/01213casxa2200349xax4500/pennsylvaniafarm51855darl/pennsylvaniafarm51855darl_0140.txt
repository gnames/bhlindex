was sold at public auction in fall of 1853, for two hundred 
 guineas, and the 4th Duke of York, for five hundred guin- 
 oas, at the great sale of the late Earl Ducie's stock. 

"Billy Pitt" was got by the celebrated Bates' Bull, 2nd 
 Duke of Oxford, 9046, E. H. B. ; also sire of Dutchess Bull, 
 4th Duke of York ; dam, Blossom, by Dutchess Bull Bel- 
 videre, 1706, E. H. B. The 2nd Duke of Oxford was got 
 by the famous Dutchess Bull, "Duke of Northumberland," 
 E. H. B. 1940; perhaps the finest Bull ever bred in Eng- 
 land. 

My young Bull Richard Booth, got by Mr. Richard 
 Booth's celebrated "Monk," now about one year old ; dam, 
 imported Rowena, bred by Hon. II. N. Hill, of Barrington, 
 got by Sir Walter 2nd, E. H. B. 10834, has been pronoun- 
 oed by good judges, a very superior animal. 

I have twenty-nine head of female short horns, generally 
 deep in the Bates' blood. 

My stock of Alderneys at this time, consists of nineteen 
 females and two male animals, mostly reserved from a large 
 number, bred by myself, and embodying strains of blood, 
 derived from selections made by Colonel Le Coutcur, Pres- 
 ident of the Royal Agricultural Society at Jersey, impor- 
 tations of Roswell L. Colt, Esq., of Patterson, N. J., and 
 from herds of the late Nicholas Biddle and Philip Physic, 
 Esqs. 

I may remark, that after five or six years experience, I 
 am extremely partial to the pure bred Alderney cattle, for 
 dairy purposes. I have found thorn to be extremely hardy, 
 never having had a single case of sickness among them ; 
 they thrive well upon a limited quantity of coarse food, but 
 with tho same amount and quality of it as is usually given 
 to short horns, are easily bred to large size. 

Philadelphia, 1855. THOMAS P. REMINGTON. 

We hope at another time, to be able to give some account 
 of this splendid farm, buildings, and extensive lawn of, 
 we should suppose, nearly 100 acres, planted with the 
 choicest assortment of ornamental trees and shrubbery. 
 Tho proprietor was absent at our visit, but we were told the 
 farm comprises over 450 acres, extending nearly a mile 
 along tho turnpike, on which we observed an osago orange 
 hedge, some four years planted, and within the enclosure, 
 a double row of elms, twenty-five feet apart, extending the 
 whole distance. 

The land appeared to us of good quailty, and in fine or- 
 der, and the style, completeness and expense of the differ- 
 ent buildings, dwelling houses, stone spring house of hewn 
 stone, paved, ceiled and plastered, carriage house, barn, 
 stabling, farm house, certainly not exceeded by any thing 
 we have yet seen in this country. Tho arrangement of the 
 farm house, with its milk cellar, ice house and seed room, 
 all under one roof with piazza extending all around it, 
 struck us as highly convenient and complete, and we should 
 be pleased to have tho plan to throw before our readers, be- 
 lieving it would be extensively imitated. A separate stair- 
 way for the farm hands to their lodging rooms, is so arrang- 
 ed as to bo outside of, and unconnected with any of the 
 other rooms. 

We saw a steaming apparatus in full operation at the 
 barn, used for steaming hay, straw, and roots for the stock. 

The ornamental trees already planted out and in rows 
 for that purpose, consisted of large numbers of our most 
 yaluable trees and shrubs, among which we observed over 
 100 fine Irish Yews at least four feet high, and the best lot 
 of that number we have ever yet seen together ; also Eng- 
 lish Yews, Irish Junipers, JuniperusExeolsa, Deodar and 
 Lebanon Cedars, Pinus Austriaca and Pinaster, Picea Pin- 
 sapo, Pinus Excelsa of fine size, andPicea Cephalonica. A 
 large lot had just arrived from Europe, comprising all tho 

new and rare evergreens, capable of standing our climate. 
 Wo doubt if there are in this country, many private collec- 
 tions of rare trees and shrubs in opon culture, to equal this 
 one. 

The above hasty notes wo made without the knowledge 
 or consent of tho proprietor, but we hope ho will excuse tho 
 liberty we have taken, as we consider tho matter of public 
 interest and for the public benefit. No one who goes to tho 
 expenso he has done, to perfect and complete as far as pos- 
 sible, not only all the general, but even most minute details 
 of high practical farming, but also every ornamental ad- 
 dition which can make country life beautiful and attractive, 
 can expect it to escape unnoticed. Our friends in New York 
 and New England know how to show oif what they have 
 done in these respects. In the neighborhood of Philadel- 
 phia, wo have farms and country seats not tho least inferi- 
 or, and wo hope in future numbers of the Journal, to fol- 
 low with other notices of some of them. 

What is "Thorough-Bred" and "Full-Blood." 

We copy tho following from the Ohio Farmer, and agree 
 with the writer that tho term full blood is very properly, 
 and should be applied only to such animals as are capable 
 in a large majority of cases of transmitting their own char- 
 ateristies to their progeny. This point is recognized here 
 and in England to be when five crosses havo been obtain- 
 ed or 31-32 portions of pure blood. The first cross say of 
 a common cow, from a pure bred animal being a half blood, 
 the second 3-4, tho third 7-8, the fourth 15-16, and the fifth 
 31-32. 

AVe think however, that tho terms thorough-bred and full 
 blood, should be considered synonymous terms. If a dis- 
 tinction is made, it is one without a difference. According 
 to the argumont of the writor, no animal can be "thorough- 
 bred," except tho original one from whom the improvement 
 was started and who may bo considered the type of the 
 breed, every animal since having more or less of crosses. 
 A number of other articles on this subject from distinguish- 
 ed breeders havo appeared in tho same paper, but wo havo 
 seen nothing to change our views. 

"I had not thought of troubling you again on tho subject 
 of thorough bred and fit 11 blood animals ; but it seems some 
 of your correspondents havo erroneous ideas, not only of 
 the meaning of tho word thorough and full, but also of the 
 terms Thorough-bred and Full-blood, as applied to breed- 
 ing. According to my dictionary which is Webster's una- 
 bridged, thorough means, "pasting through or to the end ;" 
 hence complete, perfect; and is derived through tho Saxon 
 and Gallic from the Danish word "door, a passage ;" while 
 the word full, (same authority) means "replete, abounding 
 with, having a large quantity or abundance ; as a house full 
 of furniture." These definitions aro further extended and 
 amplified, but those given are the primary andlitoral mean- 
 ing of tho words. Nor do I think of a single example in 
 which the words havo a similarity of import, or in which 
 tho one can bo substituted for the other without changing 
 tho sense. By way of illustration, wo say of a sheep, he 
 is in full fleece, ivhen ho has over one year's growth of 
 wool; but wo could not say ho was in thorough fleece, un- 
 less he had never been shorn, or had on him his entire fleece 
 since his birth. 

Breeders, in order to give meaning to the technical terms 
 thorough-bred and full-blood, call all animals full-blood 
 who aro capable, in a largo majority of cases, of transmit- 
 ting their own characteristics to their stock, but who still 
 have a trace of common blood in their pedigrees. It has 
 been ascertained, and is generally admitted in England, 
 and in this country, by breeders that an animal of fiva
