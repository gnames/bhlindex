crosses, on 31-32 pure blood, transmits in almost every in- 
 stance the characteristics of the breed. By still further 
 crossing, the quantity of impure blood may be still further 
 diminished, until it is almost entirely bred out yet thero 
 will be still a trace of tho impure blood sufficient to prevent 
 the animal ever being considered a " thorough-bred," or one 
 whose pedigree "passes through to tho end," pure and un- 
 mixed. This meaning of the word/uH is not arbitrary but 
 literal, "abounding with." 

In my former article I held that, "No number of pure 
 crosses can constitute a thorough-bred; a proposition, I 
 think, that will meet the approbation of all breeders. 

The American Turf Register, to which I referred, is ac- 
 knowledged authority, by all breeders fur the Turf in this 
 country, and the particular articles referred to, has refer- 
 ence to English judicial decisions on the subject, not to any 
 arbitrary rule. Tho amount of pure blood specified in my 
 definition, was not intended as an absolute established rule, 
 but only expresses the amount in the judgement of many 
 eminent breeders, necessary to beget in their offspring, in 
 most part tho peculiarities of the parent. 

Because an animal's pedigree has found its way into the 
 IIerd Book, it does not follow that such animal is thorough- 
 bred, unless the pedigree itself shows there is no foreign 
 cross ; nor does it follow that every animal may posses a 
 pure and undoubted pedigree, and his owner could easily 
 have it recorded if he so desired. But tho Herd Book is a 
 place of general reference, in which we trace tho different 
 gtrains of blood, and ascertain its purity. In England, 
 since its establishment, all, or most of tho thorough-breds 
 are there recorded, lest their pedigrees might become lost 
 or obscured, and tho value of the animal thereby affected. 
 For although a full-blood may transmit, in the majority of 
 cases, there is still some tendency to go back to tho impure 
 cross: while in a thorough-bred the tendency" is reversed, 
 and such only can be used with certainty. The bull Per- 
 fection may be a thorough-bred animal, doubtless is, but 
 how much more satisfactory and reliable to the breeder, had 
 his ancestry been handed down pure and undoubted through 
 the Herd Book. No person, without the pedigree, can 
 judge with certainty of the power of any animal to trans- 
 mit ; for it is beyond, doubt, a fact, that half bred animals 

Frontignan, and one Black Prince. For further information 
 how to proceed, which ho requests through tho Farm Jour- 
 nal, we copy an article on another page, on tho preparation 
 of tho border, from J. F. Allen's treatise on tho culture of tin* 
 grape, with tho remark, that it is now a disputed question 
 with growers, about the expediency of u>ung e"arcases, and 
 other strong animal manure in tho borders. Our opinion is 
 decidedly in favor of doing so, and as the right preparation 
 of tho border is one of the main secrets to success, we would 
 not think of planting a single vine, without first obtaining 
 a carcass or two and burying them at the proper depth. 
 Tho fastidious may pretend it hurts the flavor of tho grapes, 
 and say tho idea is revolting. In the chemistry of nature, 
 raw materials tho most disgusting, are resolved into the 
 most delicate and luscious combinations for tho tasto and 
 sight; and those who are disposed to faint at the thought of 
 their fruit and vegetables being grown on manured ground, 
 will havo to be satisfied with short pickings; at least, this 
 is our opinion, and would be, even if Prince Albert thought 
 differently; we have read both sides of tho question. 

Wo shall continue in another number, other extracts on 
 tho management of a cold grapery, pruning, diseases, &c. 
 The subject is attracting considerable attention, and many 
 cold graperies are being erected. Could our friend givo us 
 tho exactcost and description of his, including his own labor, 
 boarding of hands, &c? Three dollars per running foot 
 scorns a very low figure. 

A cold house can also be used to much advantago in for- 
 warding early vegetables. The distance apart for tho vines 
 to bo planted, will depend somowhat on the width of tha 
 border. If the latter is twenty feet wide, they will bear- 
 closer planting than if only twelvo feet; if tho design is to 
 raise extra sized bunches and grapes, plant four feet apart 
 instead of three. 

Durability of Timber. 

The Prairie Farmer contains the report of a discussion 
 which took place at a recent meeting of the Illinois Agri- 
 cultural Society, on the durability of timber, from which w» 
 make tho following extract: 

"Mr. Ellsworth stated that fourteen years since, he mad» 

a post and board fence of oak ; a part of the posts were sot 
 have been produced rivalling in form and beauty the most J with the top end in the earth ; these^ are^still sound, whih» 
 perfect thorough-hrcd, but entirely without the power of 
 transmitting his excellencies to his progeny. 

I am not a breeder of any kind of cattle, thorough bred 
 or full-blood, and my object only is to point out what I con- 
 ceive to bo tho true and just meaning of these terms as ap- 
 plied to breeding generally. They are already in use, and 
 even did not the words themselves warrant their adoption, 
 it would be easier to conform to established custom than to 
 adopt new terms, perhaps equally objectionable."

Cold Graperies. 
 Wo havo received a letter, from our friend B. F. Bartolet, 
 of Pughtown, Chester Co., who informs us he caught tho 
 cold grapery fever at the late Pa. State Fair; he went to 
 "work immediately on getting home, and has erected a house, 
 twolve by fourteen and a half feet, three feet high in front, 
 and eight feet at back ; covered with seven by nine glass, 
 with shutters in front and back for ventilation, tho frame 
 beviled on both sides and filled out with saw dust. The 
 cost of this house is not more than $3, per running foot. 

He has "engaged three Black Hamburgs, one White Mus- 
 cat of Alexandria, one Royal Muscadine, and has room for 
 more;" he asks our opinion which is the best; to this we 
 reply, we would not be without one white, and one grizzly 

tho remainder have all been replaced. There was no diff- 
 erence in tho quality of the timber, and a fact that a part 
 was set with the top down was purely accidental. Now, 
 when ho wishes to build a fence, he waits till his posts are 
 well seasoned, and is always careful to set with tho tops 
 down. 

We should hero observe that it is a well established fact 
 which every farmer should remember, that posts when set 
 in the ground in the manner recommended by Mr. E., in- 
 variably last much longer than when set in the usual man- 
 ner. Tho only reason why the butt end of a post is usually 
 placed in tho ground, is because it is generally tho largest. 
 A little care in splitting, and a trifling waste of timber, 
 would obviate that difficulty." 

Tho superior durability of seasoned over unseasoned 
 posts is so well established and so generally known, as to 
 scarcely bear a repetition, were it not for the fact that every 
 spring in almost every neighborhood witnessoa the plant- 
 ing of green or but partly seasoned posts. 

The most durable kinds of timber to be had in this part 
 of tho country, aro red cedar, locust, black walnut aud mul- 
 berry. We have seen posts of each of these kinds which 
 had been planted for more than thirty years, present but 
 little evidence of decay; and wo have seen others of th» 
 last named three varieties, rotten in less than ten yours.
