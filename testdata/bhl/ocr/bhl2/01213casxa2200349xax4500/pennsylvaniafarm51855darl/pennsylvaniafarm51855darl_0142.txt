Preparation of the Border for Cold Graperies. 

The border should be twenty feet wide, for each set of 
 Tines, — if thirty feet, the better, — and two and a half or 
 three feet deep; If you have but little room, you can man- 
 age to grow very fair grapes with twelvo feet of border ; but, 
 in this case, you must not plant the vines so close together. 

The following course is recommended in preparing the 
 border: — If tho soil is a good loam, begin at one end and 
 trench it; mark off ten feet the entire width; throw out tho 
 soil two feet deep; if bones, or the carcasses of animals can 
 be had, cover the bottom well with them ; if these are not 
 readily procured, slaughter-house manure may be substituted; 
 mark off ten feet more of the border, and cover this manure 
 with part of the soil from it; upon this, put an inch or two 
 of oyster shells, or old limo rubbish, mixed with broken 
 bricks; over this, put some soil from the border; then a 
 good covering of cow manure ; upon this, a slight covering 
 of loam again, followed with a good portion of oyster shells, 
 or the substitute; and over this, a thick covering of stable 
 manure, well rotted; finish with a covering of the loam. 
 The whole length is to be made in this manner, in alternate 
 spaces of ten feet each trenching. After it is finished, tho 
 border should be three feet six inches deep ; it will settle to 
 less than three feet in a few months; any soil left, after it 
 is finished, can be carried off. 

Tho proportions recommended for this border, are one- 
 half loam, one-fourth bones, or other strong manure, one- 
 eighth oyster shells, or lime and brick rubbish, and one- 
 eighth rotten manure. 

Before planting tho vines, the border should be spaded 
 over, to mix well the top substances, being careful not to 
 disturb the strong manures at bottom, as these substances, 
 when decomposing, would destroy any of the roots of the 
 vine with which they came in contact. 

Should the soil be poor, decrease the proportion used in 
 preparing the border, and, in the same ratio, increase tho 
 manures, or substitute the top soil of a loamy pasture. 

If tho soil is very poor, or unsuitable for tho purpose, so 
 as to require to bo removed entirely, then a compost, pre- 
 pared thus, is recommended ; — one half to be the top soil of 
 an old pasture ; one quarter to bo bones, or some- other 
 strong manure ; ono-oigbth oyster shells, or lime and brick 
 fubbish; one-eighth rotten manure ; theso articles thrown 
 together in a heap, and so remain until decomposed and 
 amalgamated, when they should be placed in the border, 
 and thrown loosely together. My borders, having the most 
 slaughter-house manure, or whole bones of animals in their 
 composition, still continue, as they ever have done, to pro- 
 duce tho best fruit and tho largest crops. 

It is unnecessary to attempt to give rules for every kind 
 of soil. One must use his own judgment, and make his 
 border to consist, as near as can be, of the above ingredients. 
 He must bear in mind that, if his soil is a stiff, clayey loam, 
 he must add freely of such materials as will lighten and 
 give permeability to it. If the soil is light, sandy, or gravelly, 
 ■with tho manure should bo added a proportion of clay or of 
 clayey loam. The rich alluvion soil, abounding in our 
 western and south-western States, will not roquire any of 
 thoso strong manures. If any thing is requisite to improve 
 them, it must bo shells, charcoal, leaves, small stones, or 
 gravel, — such materials as will loosen the soil. 

If a compost is to be prepared, as is usually recommended 
 by European writers on the cultivation of tho grape, by 
 taking the top soil of an old pasture, &c, and throwing 

them into a heap until decomposed, two or three years are 
 required before tho border is in readiness for the vines ; 
 whereas, by the plan which I havo adopted, tho vines may 
 be planted immediately, making due allowance in the pla- 
 cing of tho vine for its settling, which will be in proportion 
 to the freshness of the manures, or the carcasses of animals 
 that enter its compost, which, in dissolving, diminish greatly, 
 and this in ratio to the flesh upon them; the large bones 
 will change but little for many years. What is wanted in 
 a grapo border, is a rich, permeable soil, enduring in its 
 nature, in which tho roots can ramble and spread freely. 
 Too much water will injure the fruit; a deficiency of mois- 
 ture will prevent its swelling off properly. 

Turnips as Feed. 

While in attendance at the late National Poultry Show 
 at Barnum's Museum, we spent a few minutes in tho "Lcc- 
 turo Room." Our friend Mr. Solon Robinson was making 
 remarks upon the use of turnips as feed, as reported in some 
 of the journals of the day. He took the position that they 
 were good for nothing as nutriment, and sustained himself 
 by giving its analysis. This is all very well, but unfortu- 
 nately it is not in accordance with well-known facts. We 
 used to talk in the same way, but were obliged to yield not 
 simply to a few doubtful experiments, but to years of expe- 
 rience. This the speaker seemed to feel, for he admitted 
 that "in England it might not be so:" But we suppose a 
 turnip in England is very much tho same thing as a turnip 
 in New York. He also added that they should be fed by 
 turning the cattle in upon them, as they are growing in the 
 field. Wo can not see the force or propriety of this dis- 
 tinction. Is it not tho samo worthless thing before it is 
 pulled as afterwards? Must the cattle or sheep pull it, or 
 bite it off, to render it nutritious ? But even hero there is 
 no escape, for the English practice is, after the animal has 
 bitten off as much as is practicable, the root remaining in 
 the ground is then lifted by a fork and left on thp top of tho 
 ground, for the cattle to eat at pleasure. 

Wo are compelled to admit that there is something in this 
 fact of nutrition, that no doctrine of chemistry or physiology 
 is ablo to explain. The fact is unquestionable, that turnips 
 are excellent for fattening sheep and cattle, whether we can 
 explain why it is so or not. It is equally true, as Mr. R. 
 stated in tho same speech, that about 97 per cent of the flat 
 turnip, as shown by chemical analysis, consists of water. 
 These two facts, so apparently contradictory, are entirely 
 above and beyond contradiction. Wo subjoin the following, 
 on this subject, which appears in the Northern Farmer. 

"The vegetable I wish to recommend as tho best, all 
 things considered, for milch-cows in winter, is white flat 
 turnips. Some, perhaps, will object to the turnip, because 
 it will affect the taste of the milk and butter. So it does, 
 if fed raw; this can be avoided by boiling. For each cow, 
 boil a half a bushel of turnips soft; while hot, add five or 
 six quarts of shorts ; which will swell, and you will get tho 
 full worth of it. A mess like this fed to a cow onco a day, 
 will produce more milk of a good quality, than any other 
 feed at tho same cost. Turnips fed in this way do not taint 
 either milk or butter. One thing in favor of turnips as feed 
 for cows, is, that they can be sown in August, or as late as 
 tho first of September. I sowed some as late as September, 
 last year, which were very fine. Turnips aro also very 
 profitable feed for pigs, when boiled in the samo way as for 
 cows — Plow, Loom and Anvil.
