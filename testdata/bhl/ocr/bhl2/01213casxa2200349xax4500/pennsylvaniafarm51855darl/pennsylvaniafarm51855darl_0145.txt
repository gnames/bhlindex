Trifolium Incarnatum, or Crimson Clover. 

A recent number of the "Transactions of the High- 
 land Agricultural Society of Scotland," contains a prize 
 essay (for which a gold medal was awarded) by James 
 Fulton, respecting this new clover. From his several 
 trials with it during three or four years, it seems to pos- 
 sess some extraordinary properties, which will make it 
 exceedingly valuable. His series of experiments com- 
 menced in 1852, and were nine in number, extending 
 down to quite a recent period. From them he estab- 
 lishes the faet that the crimson clover flowers over a 
 long period of its growth ; that its rapid and luxuriant 
 vegetation is hardly equalled by any other plant, coming 
 forward to the scythe in ten or twelve weeks after being 
 sown ; that its product to the acre is very large, and it 
 answers capitally to precede a crop of wheat, both by 
 its mechanical effect on the soil, and from its alleged 
 power of collecting nitrogen. In one of the experiments 
 the wheat after the crimson clover, was one-third heavier 
 than after turnips, other circumstances being similar ; 
 and it is thought it will be quite possible to grow it in 
 England as an intermediate or stolen crop between a 
 wheat and turnip crop, provided it can be got into the 
 ground by the middle or before the end of August. In 
 the first experiment, the seed was sown on the 12th of 
 May, and on the 17th the blade began to appear above 
 ground, and on the 23d the leaves were fully developed. 
 On the 21st of August (same season) one square was cut 
 from three separate parts of the field, the average weight 
 of which (green from the scythe) gave eighteen and a 
 half tons to the imperial acre ; some of the plants meas- 
 uring four feet three and a half inches in height. The 
 flowering commenced by the end of June, when the 
 height of the plants was eleven to thirteen inches, and it 
 matured seeds by the 1st of September. When in full 
 bloom the field was an object of striking beauty, pre- 
 senting to the eye one unbroken sheet of scarlet. It 
 appeared to be an especial favorite with bees ; on look- 
 ing at it on a fine day in July, it was difficult to fix on a 
 single plant that had not many of them upon it. 

In the third experiment, the crimson clover was sown 
 on the 17th of July after a crop of potatoes had been 
 taken off. It came up on the third day, and grew so 
 rapidly as to cover the groiind in an incredibly short 
 time. The weight of the crop was taken on the 17th of 
 October, three months after the date of sowing, and was 
 found to weigh twenty-one and a half tons to the impe- 
 rial acre. 

Among other phenomena in the third experiment, was 
 noticed its extraordinary power of resisting frost, free 
 radiation, and a remarkably succulent condition, which 
 may account for the surprising weight of the crop. Its 
 radiating powers, to which its immunity from the effects 
 of frost were probably due, were very conspicuous in 
 dewy and frosty mornings. In the former the clover 
 was bent down by the deposit of dew, which was much 
 heavier than on other plants, and in the latter it was so 
 densely covered with hoar as to appear like a fall of 
 snow. 

The above are extraordinary statements. We have 
 made arrangements to procure some seed for trial in the 
 United States. It is said to be an Italian species. 

Alsike Clover. 

As there have been numerous enquiries the present 
 season for alsike clover, by many of our enterprising far- 
 mers, who wish to give a trial at least to every new arti- 
 cle, that promises to be of any value, we have made 
 some examination into its history, and find that it has 
 been cultivated for many years in Sweden in the district 
 of Alsike, whence its name, and that it is generally consid- 
 ered a hybrid, between the white and red clovers, there- 
 fore called "Trifolium Hybridum. It is said to throw 
 out a great number of stems from one root, even as many 
 as thirty. It is a perennial plant, grows very rapidly 
 after cutting, and is said to be remarkable for standing 
 well the hardest frosts. Dr. Emerson, in his Farmer's 
 Encyclopedia, which by the way treats on every thing 
 relating to agriculture, arranged in alphabetical order, 
 says: "Alsike Clover possesses the strength and vigor of 
 the red, with the permanency of the white clover." We 
 hope many of our friends will give it a trial the present 
 season and forward us the results. 

It can be obtained, we understand, at the seed stores 

in this city at $1 per lb.

Large Oaks. 
 Dr. Elwyn informs us in reference to the article in last 
 Farm Journal on large oaks, that there are two in East 
 Bradford, Chester county, one on his own farm, and the 
 other on the adjoining farm of Jonathan Paxson, both 
 exceeding in size that referred to in Bartram's garden, 
 one being over twenty-one feet, and the other over nine- 
 teen feet in circumference. 

The White Blackberry. 
 The White Blackberry is a most vigorous grower, often 
 attaining a height of ten feet. It is a much more prolific 
 bearer than the common variety, or field blackberry, the 
 buds being set on the stalks in the immediate vicinity of 
 each other — there being generally not more than the 
 distance of two inches between them, and each bud hav- 
 ing two spurs instead of one, as in the case with the lat- 
 ter. The berries are of large size, amber colored, and 
 possessing a flavor remarkably rich and sweet. There 
 is no difficulty whatever attending its cultivation ; all 
 that is essentially requisite being a rich, light, and mod- 
 erately warm soil, and a copious and sustained supply 
 of forest leaves and scrapings. A compost formed of 
 these, with a small quantity of gypsum, and frequent 
 hoeings to lighten the soil and prevent the radiation and 
 growth of weeds, will almost invariably secure success 
 in the cultivation of this valuable fruit. The original 
 cultivator of this fruit in this country, is Mr. J. S. 
 Needham, of Danvers, Mass., and "Needham's White 
 Blackberry," of which a very good engraving was pub- 
 lished some time since in the New England Farmer, is 
 probably the most prolific and valuable variety of the 
 fruit to be found. The White Blackberry and Black 
 Raspberry are both valuable fruits, and should have a 
 place in every fruit and kitchen garden in the land. —

Valuable Sheep. 
 J. S. Patterson has recently sold, in Wisconsin, a 
 number of French merino ewes, at $200 each, and a year 
 old buck for $1,000.
