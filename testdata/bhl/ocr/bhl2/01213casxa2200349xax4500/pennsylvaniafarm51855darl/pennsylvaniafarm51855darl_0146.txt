Allen's Mowing Machine. 

To the Editor of the Farm Journal : — In the 
 Farm Journal for March, a communication appeared 
 over the signature of Thomas Wood, from which, as it 
 appears to me, very prejudicial and unjust inferences 
 might be drawn in reference to Allen's mower. 

The judgment of a person as to the respective merits 
 of a plow, scythe or cradle, who is entirely unaccus- 
 tomed to their use, would not be considered very safe or 
 reliable. Much more so is it the case with farm ma- 
 chinery, which is more or less complicated, requiring a 
 degree of experience and practical knowledge rarely 
 possessed by the majority of those who purchase. 

I purchased an Allen mower last season, made by the 
 firm of Lee & Co., which certainly was not finished as it 
 should have been for the price paid for it, or for the re- 
 putation of the inventor and manufacturer. Yet, with 
 its defects, which were confined principally to the screw 
 bolts and shank of the knives, which I remedied in part, 
 I would not take five hundred dollars for the machine, 
 with the understanding that I was to return back to the 
 scythe and snead. 

My grass last season was badly lodged, and upon in- 
 troducing the machine into the field as it came from the 
 shops, like our friend's it did not perform well. It was 
 set too low, raising the stones out from the surface of 
 the soil into the knives, choked badly, and as a matter 
 of course worked hard for the team. I set it higher by 
 inserting a piece of wood in between the upper side of 
 the tongue and the lower side of the staple, which 
 steadies the tongue ; ground the half knife at the ex- 
 treme end of the bar ; sharpened the rest with a com- 
 mon hand saw file ; tightened the burrs, and was then 
 enabled to cut wet or dry, lodged or standing, with no 
 more draft, except in spots, than I experienced in ordi- 
 nary sod plowing, and no perceptible side draft, as in 
 operating I had to guide the horses about as much to- 
 wards the grass as from it. 

Imposition is practiced to a great extent in the use of 
 lolled iron for bolts just as it comes from the mill. No 
 manufacturer who has a true regard for his reputation 
 as a mecbanic, and as a just and honorable man to those 
 who confide in his integrity to furnish machinery not 
 liable to get easily out of order, should use screw bolts 
 which require unscrewing at time, without square shanks, 
 an inch or two in length from the head, proportionate to 
 the depth of wood in which they are imbedded, and to 
 the strain necessary to secure the burr in its proper po- 
 sition. They should also be double burred where the 
 strain is severe, with a spring key inserted below the 
 burrs to keep them in their proper place. 

The prices paid for machines at present appear to me 
 to be very generous, taking the value of the material of 
 which they are composed into consideration; yet I should 
 regard it as quite a speculation to pay an extra price for 
 such as are thoroughly finished, having all parts made 
 proportionate to the strain brought to bear upon them, 
 as then they would be likely to be in order for business 
 at all times, especially when time is most valuable, un- 
 less injured through carelessness or accidents. 

I think that I obtained over three tons of hay by the 
 use of the mower more than I should have had by using 
 the scythe last season, besides being satisfied as to the 

amount of strength I could rely upon. Indeed so effec- 
 tive was it in its operation, although not well put to- 
 gether, that I had not one full swath mowed with the 
 scythe across my fields. THOS. HOPKINS.

Manures. 

Mr. Dariington : — We are pleased to see that the at- 
 tention of farmers is so frequently called to the subject 
 of manures through the columns of the "Farm Journal." ( 
 The matter that has appeared in its pages on this sub- 
 ject from time to time has been important help to us in 
 the management of our manure heaps. 

There is not a farmer who subscribes for your Jour- 
 nal, and practices but half of what he will find on this 
 subject alone, but who is paid ten times over the amount 
 of his subscription. The manure heap is really the 
 "farmer's bank," as it is often termed ; and in propor- 
 tion to the issues the farmer is able to make from it 
 yearly in quality and quantity, in about like proportion 
 will be his yearly income. 

It is also very evident that as at present managed by 
 farmers generally, there is no one way in which they 
 are so wasteful and sustain such regular and heavy 
 losses. It would be no difficult matter in a day's travel 
 through some sections of this State, to point out more 
 than a score of barnyards where manure is wasting an- 
 nually, the value of which is more than equal to all the 
 taxes the farmers are subject to. 

If farmers would take the care of their manures they 
 might do at a trifling cost, their taxes could be paid and 
 not feel them to be such a burden as we often do. The 
 old adage, "penny wise and pound foolish," can be said 
 of farmers often with too much truth. One will meet^' 
 continually with those who are industrious, and practice 
 the most rigid economy in most that concerns them, yet 
 they do not seem to dream that the rains are carrying 
 away from their manure heap annually what is worth to 
 them from fifty to a hundred dollars, which could be all 
 saved at but little cost. 

There have been numerous plans suggested to the far- 
 mers for improving the quality of manure, and to pre- 
 vent it from wasting from the yard. One is the erection 
 of a shed over the entire mass. This may be proper in 
 some cases, but to it there are, we think, some very 
 grave objections ; and besides it is an expense that far- 
 mers generally will not be willing to incur. That sun- 
 shine and showers materially diminish the quality and 
 quantity too of the manure heap in a badly constructed 
 yard, or when little or no care is taken of the heap it- 
 self, is a fact that every farmer ought to be aware of; 
 and this he may prevent in a good measure at much less 
 expense than erecting sheds. 

Instead of the manure yard being level or oval, as is 
 often the case, it should be of a basin form, considerably 
 hollowed out, so as to retain the juices, and be a recep- 
 tacle also for whatever material may be thrown in to .1 
 make manure. This can be done to most yards in a 
 short time by plowing it up, and with a horse scraper 
 running the loose ground out around the edge of the 
 yard. But this will be of little use in preventing the 
 manure from being leached and wasted by the rains, if 
 the water is suffered to run from the roof of the bara
