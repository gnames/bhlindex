Leo. As I made a partial, though not comparative, trial 
 as then recommended at the time indicated, I will give 
 the result, which, if you, Mr. Editor, consider worthy a 
 place in the Journal, you are welcome to publish. 

I had a "patch" of the blackberry briar, that had ta- 
 ken full possession of three contiguous worm row fence 
 corners ; frequently before I had them grubbed out, and 
 that too in the "hottest and driest weather of August," 
 but so far from eradicating the patch — the more the 
 digging the more vigorous the growth in subsequent 
 years. So on this nest of "squatters" I concluded to 
 try if the moon would lend me its aid in destroying 
 them. I went to work with mattock in hand at the pre- 
 cise time as stated by "C," and with considerable labor 
 and some "scratches" dug out every sprout, and as 
 many of the roots as I conveniently could, yet many 
 roots were left in the ground. The next year (1853) 
 only a few sprouts made their appearance — these did not 
 grow over two feet in height, had a sickly appearance, 
 and died out without further attention in 1854. 

Such are the simple facts, each one may draw his own 
 conclusions, and try the experiment for his own satis- 
 faction. It is only a single experiment, and of course 
 requires confirmation by repeated and more extended 
 experiments. A single grain of sand does not make a 
 sea shore, and if others will give publicity to their ex- 
 periments, and continue them, we may in time arrive at 
 some definite conclusions. J. B. GARBER.

Holcus Saccharatus. 
 To the Editor of the Florist : — Sir : — In the last 
 number of the Florist, is an article from the Gardeners' 
 Chronicle, which I am not sure that I exactly under- 
 stand. It is concerning "A new Sugar Cane." We are 
 told, "a novelty has this year appeared, in the form of a 
 tall, reedy grass, called Holcus saccharatus, of whose 
 economical value we find that great expectations are en- 
 tertained." It is then stated that this "Chinese Sugar 
 Cane" (as it is also called) yields Sugar copiously, — 
 much more than the Beet, &c. Now, what I want to 
 know, is the real character of this " novelty. " If it is 
 the Holcus saccharatus, of Linnaeus — the Sorghum sac- 
 charatum, of Persoon, I do not understand why it is re- 
 garded as a "novelty." Every body, in this country, is 
 familiar with the plant, under the name of "Broom 
 Corn;" and it has long been cultivated (in some parts 
 very extensively) for the purpose of making brooms, 
 whisks, and clothes brushes. The books tell us, it has 
 long been cultivated, in Italy, as & substitute for the 
 Sugar Cane. But I strongly suspect it is inferior in 
 value, for that object, to the Indian Corn, of our coun- 
 try. Yet, whatever its value may be, it has no claim to 
 be styled a "novelty." If it is not the Holcus sacchara- 
 tus, of Linnaeus, it has no right to that old established 
 name; but must be called something else. The question 
 then recurs, ivhat is it ? The answer must be left to 
 you, and the Gardeners' Chronicle ; and, for me, I shall 
 be glad to learn its true character. Those writers who 
 treat us to such novelties as new "Wheat," made from 
 yEgilops, and new "Sugar Cane," from Holms, are very 
 remiss, in my humble opinion, in not following up their 
 discoveries, by conclusive demonstrations of the real 

facts of the cases stated, and the true character of the 
 plants indicated. Naturalists, now-a-days, like to have 
 some reliable evidence of what they are asked to believe ; 
 and clear, definite statements, concerning all alleged 
 novelties. W. D.

In connection with the Florist, and most of the Amer- 
 ican agricultural journals, we published the extract 
 from the London Gardeners' Chronicle — usually good 
 authority in such matters. The above article by W. D. 
 will doubtless soon clear up the mystery, whether in the 
 name or the substance. — Ed. Farm Journal. 

Grafted Chestnut Trees. 

The Cincinnati Gazette publishes an interesting letter 
 from Mr. Sheldon I. Kellogg, to the Wine Growers' As- 
 sociation, dated Bordeaux, France, on the cultivation of 
 the chestnut. He says : 

"I have been much surprised in seeing the great de- 
 pendence the poorer classes make upon the large chest- 
 nut for their daily food. It is cultivated in this neigh- 
 borhood in great abundance for this purpose. All 
 classes use them more or less ; the rich having them 
 daily brought upon their tables as dessert, either boiled 
 or roasted. It is often made into a soup, which is high- 
 ly esteemed. They are cooked in a multitude of ways, 
 and I know of nothing of a farinaceous nature which is 
 so very delicate and nourishing. 

" The marron, or large chestnut, is the produce of the 
 wild chestnut after being engrafted. The wild tree, at 
 three or four years of age, is cut square off, say four or 
 five feet from the ground. The stump is then split 
 twice. These splits intersect at right angles at the cen- 
 tre of the stump. There is then inserted one good-sized 
 branch of the same tree in every section of the splits, 
 making four branches in each stump. Care is always 
 taken to make the bark of the branches and the bark of 
 the stump join each other as closely as possible. The 
 graft is then surrounded with clay and moss, to prevent 
 the overflow of the sap, and it scarcely ever fails of suo- 
 cess. The period selected in this climate for this opera- 
 tion is the month of February. The produce of thi3 
 graft is usually a fine, large, beautifully colored marron, 
 about the size of our buckeyes. They are much more 
 delicate in texture and flavor than our own wild chest- 
 nut. They are never eaten without being cooked. The 
 tree is very beautiful." 

Rye Grass. 

." Twenty Tons of Hat per Acre. — It was stated by 
 Mr. Cird, at an agricultural dinner given by Mr. Mechi, 
 in England, recently, that twenty tons of hay had been 
 raised off a single acre, in Scotland, the last season. It 
 was Italian rye grass, which grows to a great height in 
 the humid climate of Scotland, and he cut from seven to 
 ten times from March to December. In the instance 
 named, it was cut ten times, but after each cutting, an 
 abundant application of liquid manure was made." 

The above from an English paper, when cut down one 
 half, which is probably nearer the truth, will still serve 
 to give an idea of the estimate put upon Rye Grass in 
 England, and its extraordinary productiveness. Perhaps 
 Mr. C. meant twenty tons of grass— " uncured hay."
