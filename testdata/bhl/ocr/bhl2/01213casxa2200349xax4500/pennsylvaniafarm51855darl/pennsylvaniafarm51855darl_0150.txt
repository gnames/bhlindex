The White Carrot. 
 Col. De Coutettr, in some able remarks upon the pro- 
 ductiveness of this vegetable, says that the acreable pro- 
 duct is about thirty-eight tons. When we take into the 
 estimate the superior excellence and value of the Belgian 
 or White carrot for stock feeding, this -will appear a 
 very good crop, although far less than is often afforded 
 by turnips or even beets. The carrot, in all its varieties, 
 is a crop requiring a good soil and thorough cultivation, 
 but probably one of the best crops the farmer can pro- 
 duce. Lord Duce estimates the expense of cultivating 
 the white carrot "at little more than half the cost of 
 growing any other root crop known to him." The pro- 
 duct also of the "whites" exceeds that of the "reds" 
 from eight nine to tons per statute acre on the same soil. 
 We have cultivated the white carrot only in small quan- 

tities, and cannot say with any degree of confidence what 
 their comparative merits are. But the opinions of others 
 maty perhaps lead us to a higher estimate of some crops 
 not now usually cultivated among us. — iV. E. Far-

Mange in Cattle. 
 The disorder termed the mange arises from the excite- 
 ment of the skin, probably brought on by disarrangement 
 of the organs of digestion in consequence of poverty, 
 engendered by hunger and want of shelter. After these 
 are supplied, a wash made of gunpowder and water — 
 charcoal, nitre and sulphur — will be found a valuable 
 application. MaDge is an infectious disorder; remove 
 therefore the sick beast from the rest of the herd. — Bos-
