THE FARM JOURNAL.

For the Farm Journal. 
 Practical Work of the Farm. 

Mr. Darlington : — Although my former communication 
 under this head has not been responded to, I will continue 
 to give my experience, hoping it will yet bring some of 
 more value from tho working farmers who patronize the 
 Farm Journal. 

I was one of the celebrated committee No. 18, that were 
 expected in a few hours to carefully examine aud select of 
 each, the best of its kind, out of, I should think, two acres 
 of agricultural implements, divided into half and quarter 
 crae lots, by rows of poultry and marching columns, of the 
 washed and unwashed million. And this too, in a cloud of 
 dust that seemed to obscure every thing but the sun, who, in 
 Bpite of it, kept the thermometer at blood heat. But not- 
 withstanding our supposed supernatural powers of body and 
 mind, I understand we received censure for not awarding 
 the first premium for horse power corn-shellers to Reading's 
 Patent. If any blame is deserved, I take it all to myself, 
 and entirely exonerate the other members of the committee. 
 Through the kindness of the proprietor of the Agricultural 
 Warehouse at West Chester, I was permitted to take one of 
 Reading's Shellers to my barn, and give it a trial before pur- 
 chasing. I attached it to a tread-taill horse-power, and 
 gave it, what I supposed a fair trial ; and the next day 
 returned it, not for its want of power to shell fast and clean, 
 but because the speed could not be easily regulated when 
 attached to that kind of horse-power ; and also its breaking 
 the grain and cob more than those exhibited by Pennock 
 and Davis. The fault of the latter machines, is, they do not 
 give work enough for horse-power ; and you therefore wear 
 your horse and power unnecessarily. To obviate all this, I 
 requested Mr. Alexander Major of the Indian Run Factory, 
 to construct one on the old plan, but with four holes instead 
 of two, as formerly used ; after I had given him the idea, 
 he carried it out beyond my expectations. It has the same 
 shafts, cogwheels, journals, &c. ; the frame being made wide 
 enough and the shafts long enough to admit another set of 
 Bhelling wheels. He attached a cob-carrier, similar to the 
 straw-carriers, with this exception, instead of the suspending 
 Straps, the cob-carrier is kept in its place by guide irons, 
 working in holes in the posts of the machines. It has a 
 large box like the feed trough of a wagon, hooked under the 
 feeding holes. We do not alter our horse-power, when 
 changing from wheat or oats, but if the corn is dry, we 
 generally use a smaller horse. It will of course shell just 
 twice as much as the two-holed when driven by horse-power 
 with tho same amount of hands ; as the cob-raker is dis- 
 pensed with, not a grain of shelled corn passes over the 
 shaker. It shells by hand as well as the common kind; in 
 'this, having the advantage over Reading's, which can only 
 be used for horse-power. I do not believe a committee 
 would be justifiable in awarding a premium for an entirely 
 new principle, when it was self evident, that a slight addi- 
 tion to the old machine would make it superior; it would 
 lead us on tho wrong track, and we could not arrive at the 
 right place by following it. 

I have advised the enterprising young men that now carry 
 on the Indian Run Machine Shops, (Messrs. Page and 
 Essick,) to send one of them to Mr. Entriken's Agricultural 
 Warehouse, (West Chester,) that farmers may judge for 
 themselves. 

I have also a few words to say in another matter con- 
 cerning this committee. We were required to award a pre- 
 mium for the "best corn cultivator," and (if I remember 
 rightly) "for the best cultivator for general purposes." We- 
 6oon agreed on the contracting and expanding hoe-harrow, 
 for the be6t corn cultivator ; and as I must confess I did not 

exactly know what was meant, by the best for general pur- 
 poses, I left it to my associates. After they left for home 
 there was some difficulty in pointing out the premium article, 
 and as I was referred to, I think it quite likely I did them 
 injustice by pointing out the wrong article; and if so, I 
 owe an apology to the numerous family of scrapers, hoers, 
 plowers, rooters, scratchers, diggers, and pickers, then and 
 there assembled. 

The best corn cultivator in connection with the hoe-harrow 
 is the double shovel plow with steel points. It has several 
 advantages over all other implements ; by placing your 
 hands forward you can put your weight over the shovel, and 
 make it work in stony or unplowed spots; you can lift it 
 over or around stumps or rocks, working up to them on 
 every side, finishing a row at every round (if not more than 
 four feet), and requiring no more space to turn on, than the 
 horse would require without them. I never knew a practical 
 farmer that once used one, to exchange it for any thing 
 else; they are almost universally used in the north-western 
 townships of this county, and fast spreading south and eastj 
 yet I doubt i>f one can be found in any Agricultural Ware- 
 house in the State. But they have several objections as a 
 mercantile article ; they have no cast iron about them, and 
 are not easily broken; any common country blacksmith can 
 make or mend the iron work; and the farmer himself could 
 at a pinch make the wood work. The very name of lioko, 
 (which farmers used to swear by a thousand years ago,) 
 sounds too old fashioned, and would be condemned in scien- 
 tific circles. 

I claim the honor of being the first to introduce them (as 
 corn cultivators) in Chester county. I saw them used to 
 put in wheat in Lancaster county, and their adaptation to 
 corn cultivation, struck me at once; but if any one has an 
 older claim, I will freely acknowledge his preemption right.

Profits of Feeding. 

Mr. Darlington: — I am not accustomed to write for 
 the public, as it is trouble enough for me to write my own 
 private letters. 

I see many puffs in our agricultural papers about raising 
 extra breed and heavy hogs, but nine times out of ten they 
 never say how they feed their stock, or how old they were 
 when slaughtered ; now what does all that amount to in 
 putting such stuff in our agricultural papers, which is not 
 likely to benefit the community? Give us age and the mode 
 of feeding, and then we can judge whether there is any 
 thing extra about their stock ; take for example the Suffolk 
 breed in your last number and the cut accompaning the 
 same ; I care not how well they look on paper, as that does 
 not tell me what profit it would be to change my breed and 
 get Suffolks. Then again, take Mr. Stepleton's eight hogs 
 with their different weights, and what does it all amount to; 
 he don't say whether his pigs were one or two years old, 
 neither does he say whether they were fed one year or six 
 months, or how much corn they got. 

I think, Mr. Editor, you will agree with me that our 
 agricultural journals are intended to enlighten the commu- 
 nity on all matters belonging to agriculture, and not for 
 empty boasting. 

I will give you and the public a sample of six pigs ; three I 
 slaughtered about New Years. They were then between five 
 and six months old, and weighed from one hundred and 
 forty to one hundred and sixty-five pounds; they were the 
 smallest of the six I had ; the other three I slaughtered 
 when seven months old, the first weighed two hundred and 
 twenty-five pounds, the second, two hundred and six, the 
 third, one hundred and seventy-eight pounds. These pigs
