were neither Suffolks, Berkshire, nor Chester county breed, 
 but what I call a good Lancaster county breed and well 
 kept; their keeping was for the first three months, about six 
 pounds each of chopped corn and oats, half of each with 
 water enough to make it into a thin slop, till within the last 
 three months, when I increased the feed some little. I do 
 not wish to be understood to boast on the subject, but merely 
 to show what I would call a proper statement, to give every 
 man a chance to know whether the stock spoken of is supe- 
 rior or inferior to his own. I wish it understood, that I have 
 none of my stock for sale, but only write to give a satisfac- 
 tory statement to the public. I hope Mr. Editor you will 
 not hereafter publish any thing without there is a detailed 
 account of expenses given upon the subject; we see almost 
 every week, something of the kind put forth that is of no 
 use only to mislead and deceive such as are willing to be 
 the dupes. J. F.

There is considerable force in our correspondent's remarks. 
 Farmers are not so particular in counting expenses as they 
 should be. It is not the mere weight of an animal, but the 
 weight for food consumed, which makes the profit or other- 
 wise. There is a possibility of erery bushel of corn fed, 
 being merely sunk, unless an account is kept accurately. 
 There is one article, we have often thought much wanted and 
 seldom seen about the barn, a Platform Scale for weighing 
 not only feed, but also constructed so as to weigh smaller 
 animals, calves, sheep, hogs, &c, while fattening. Those on 
 wheels, so as to be readily moved about and calculated to 
 weigh five to seven or eight hundred, can be purchased for 
 about twenty-five dollars. It would also be a great conve- 
 nience in selling grain, and its many advantages would soon 
 amply repay cost. — Ed. 

f Allen's Mower. 

Mr. Editor : — I see in the March number of your Jour- 
 nal, an account of the trials and difficulties of a correspon- 
 dent, living near Penningtonville, in this county, in his 
 unsuccessful attempts to mow with one of Allen's Mowers. 
 He seems to think because he did not succeed very well, no 
 one else could possibly have done any better ; at least, he 
 insinuates as much in his communication. 

Now, if a person who^s a judge of mowing, would look at 
 a company of men cutting grass with a scythe, he could 
 very readily see the difference in their performance ; while 
 one would appear to mow with ease, another would put forth 
 his utmost exertions to perform the same work. Again, if 
 you would put a scythe in the hands of a man who knows 
 nothing about mowing, and set him to work in heavy, lodged 
 grass, your correspondent's five acre lot, if you please, ten 
 chances to one, he has to go to the "shop" as often as our 
 worthy friend had to with his machine. It is the same with 
 the mowing machine as with the scythe ; if you have every 
 thing in order, and somebody that can work it, it cannot 
 help performing well and easy. 

He complains of the draft being too much to one side, &c, 
 as the "dozens who came to see it will testify, and all found 
 fault with it." If I had had no better success, I would rather 
 there would have been a few less than dozens to see me. 
 He says, he employed a man to cut round the corners, as 
 the machine would not do it without too much trouble. I 
 would rather have a man to dig round the corners when I 
 plow, than to cut around them where I am mowing ; the 
 only successful way is to put on a square corner ; hence our 
 friend's difficulty in that respect. 

Again, he says, he had a boy to throw away the cut grass 
 when it was in the road of the machine in passing over. 
 This was the fault of the driver, if he had driven with pre- 

cision, the grass would not have been in the way. To per- 
 form rightly, you must drive exact; the knife must have 
 full cut and no more; to give it less than full cut, it will 
 catch the grass and choke. He complains of the knives 
 getting loose; if he had taken an old axe and hammer, he 
 might easily have fastened them. He also says, it would 
 not "back;" if he had only thrown it out of gear, which is 
 but the work of a moment, it would have backed with all 
 ease. He next says, the screw burrs were continually coming 
 off; if he had taken a cold chisel, and cut the bolts slightly, 
 I'll warrant they would not have troubled him any more in 
 that respect. 

Since I saw this statment, I waited upon a neighbor for 
 whom I mowed one day, and he says, I cut twelve acres; 
 and part of it turned off three tons to the acre, and that I 
 was hardly a day at it, as I was detained, somewhat, by the 
 many visitors who came to see the operation. When they 
 saw with what success mine performed, some of them said 
 they would have them for themselves against another har- 
 vest; and I know of three having already sent in orders to 
 procure them, for fear the supply would "not be equal to the 
 demand," as our friend says. If he would only come over 
 to Honeybrook, he could procure other evidence besides 
 mine, as to the success of the mower, as there were others 
 besides myself who used them to their entire satisfaction. 

I think our friend made a slight mistake in his calculation 
 as to the speed of the team ; it would not require very fast 
 horses to walk two miles an hour, to say nothing about how 
 far good ones can go. The mower has a cut of four feet 
 and a half, and the days some fifteen hours long, he can 
 easily see, it would not be an over calculation, when I say 
 if it were pushed a little it would cut fifteen acres in a day. 
 He says, they were obliged to put three horses to the mower 
 over there. Now you might just as well put three men to a 
 scythe, for Allen's mower is made for two horses ; the knives 
 operate in the same manner as shears, and if they are kept 
 close to the guards they will work easy, but if they are left 
 apart, the blades not working closely together, they will 
 work hard; and if you force it with three horses you are 
 sure to break it. It would be a great pity indeed, if his 
 want of success should discourage any one from getting so 
 valuable a labor, money and time, saving machine.

Selection of Seeds. 

Every one ought to know that there is a great difference 
 in the productiveness and flavor of our common garden 
 products. In fact, some of the varieties are scarcely wor- 
 thy of notice. Therefore when you go to the expense of 
 laying out a garden, you should endeavor to procure none 
 other than the choicest kinds of vegetables, and such as 
 will afford a succession of crops. It is a great object with 
 market men to raise the earliest and latest varieties, which 
 always command tho best prices. And it is no less impor- 
 tant for families, who can, by proper management, derive 
 the greater part of their living from the garden. The la- 
 bor and cost of cultivation are no greater, while the profit 
 and satisfaction are much increased. 

In the beginning of your labors, you must of necessity 
 procure the seeds from some enterprising neighbor, or a reg- 
 ular seedsman. In the latter case, go to a well known and 
 responsible person, — if possible, one of your acquaintances. 
 It is generally understood, that of the seeds annually ex- 
 posed for sale, a very large part are worthless, having lost 
 their vitality, or being of inferior varieties. The vexation 
 of preparing land and realizing nothing, is equalled by 
 waiting patiently for several months to obtain nothing but
