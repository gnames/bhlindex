a small, tough, stringy product. It is not a fine sounding 
 name which makes a valuable variety. 

But, with all your care, you may get deceived. Perhaps 
 the seed will not vegetate, or it proves different from what 
 It was represented. Even then you must not hastily im- 
 pute blame to the seedsman. It cannot be expected that 
 he should raise all that he sells, and he may have been 
 deceived as well as yourself. In the absence of proof, or 
 very strong grounds of suspicion, it certainly would be 
 wrong to believe him guilty of fraud. You must not jump 
 at a conclusion. Because the seed did not vegetate, is no 
 evidence that it icould not have done so if placed in favor- 
 able circumstances. That plants do not appear above 
 ground, may have been caused by your own ignorance ; 
 perhaps the seed was buried so low that its tender stem 
 could not reach the surface, or else covered so slightly that 
 the germ, as soon as it manifested itself, was killed by the 
 heat Defect of germination may have been the result of 
 natural causes, such as excessive heat or cold, or the ex- 
 treme dryness or dampness of the ground. For these rea- 
 sons, you should be positively certain, before you dare level 
 a blow at a man's reputation. 

To discover whether seeds possess the power of vegeta- 
 tion, is quite as important for your own benefit, as to test 
 the seedsman's honesty. Sowing dead seed will occasion 
 the loss of much time and patience. You should, therefore, 
 take a little of that which you consider doubtful, and steep 
 it in warm water for several hours, when, if it show unmista- 
 kable signs of sprouting, you may sow as soon as you please. 
 The only way to discover whether you have been cheated 
 In the quality of the plant, is to wait patiently until the 
 crop comes to maturity. — Schenck's Gardener's Text-Book*

 Pruning: — Decidedly the best mode of pruning for a cold 
 house, or vinery without fire-heat, is what is called the long 
 or renewal mode. Supposing the house to be planted with 
 good young plants, something like the following mode of 
 training and pruning may bo adopted. The first season one 
 shoot only is allowed to proceed from each plant, and this, 
 at the end of the first season, is cut down to the second or 
 third eye or bud. The year following two leading shoots 
 are encouraged, the strongest of which is headed or stopped 
 when it has extended a few joints beyond the middle of the 
 house or rafter, and tho weaker about half that length. In 
 November these -shoots are reduced, the strong ono having 

four or five joints cut from its extremity, and tho weaker 
 one to tho third eye from its lower end or place of origin. 
 In the third season one leading shoot is laid in from each of 
 these, the stronger one throwing out side shoots on which 
 the fruit is produced, which side shoots are allowed to 
 mature one bunch of grapes each, and are topped at one or 
 two joints above the fruit. No side shoots are allowed to 
 proceed from the weaker shoot, but it is laid in, to produce 
 fruit the ensuing season, so that by the third season after 
 planting, the lower part of the house or rafters is furnished 
 with a crop of fruit proceeding from wood of the preceding 
 year. At next autumn pruning, the longest of these main 
 shoots is shortened about eighteen inches from the top of 
 the rafter, and the next in strength to about the middle 
 of the rafter, and all the spurs which had borne fruit are 
 removed. Each vine is now furnished with two shoots of 
 bearing wood, a part of old barren wood which has already 
 produced fruit, and a spur near the bottom for producing a 
 young shoot for the following year. In the fourth summer 
 a full crop is produced, both in the upper and lower part of 
 the house, the longer or oldest shoot producing fruit on the 
 upper part of its length, and the shortor on its whole length; 
 from this last, a leading shoot is laid in, and another to 
 succeed it is produced from the spur near the bottom. At 
 the next autumn pruning, the oldest or longest shoot, which 
 has now reached the top of the house, is entirely cut out 
 and removed, and replaced by that which was next in suc- 
 cession to it, and this in its turn is also cut out and replaced 
 by that immediately behind it, a succession of a yearly 
 shoot being obtained from the lower part of the old stem. 
 [MxsIntoshJ] This is decidedly the most successful mode for 
 a vinery without heat, producing abundant and fair crops of 
 fruit. Hoare, who is one of the most experienced and 
 ingenious writers on the Grape, strongly recommends it, 
 and suggests that "the old wood of a vine, or that which has 
 previously produced fruit, is not only of no further use, but 
 is a positive injury to the fertility of the plant. The truth 
 of this remark depends on the fact that every branch of a 
 vine which produces little or no foliage, appropriates for its 
 own support a portion of the juices of the plant that is 
 generated by those branches that do produce foliage." 

Routine of Culture : — In a vinery without heat this is 
 comparatively simple. As soon a^i the vines commenco 
 swelling their buds in the spring, they should be carefully 
 washed with m,ild soap suds, to free them from any insects, 
 soften the wood, and assist the buds to swell regularly. At 
 least three or four times every week, they should be well 
 syringed with water, which, when the weather is cool, 
 should always be done in the morning. And every day the 
 vine border should be daily supplied with water. During 
 the time when the vines are in blossom, and while the fruit 
 is setting, all sprinkling or syringing over tho leaves must 
 be suspended, and the house should be kept a little more 
 closed and warm, than usual, and should any indications of 
 mildew appear on any of the branches it may at once be 
 checked by dusting them with flower of sulphur. Air must 
 be given liberally every day when the temperature rises in 
 the house, beginning by sliding down the top sashes a little 
 in tho morning, more at mid-day, and then gradually closing 
 them in the same manner. To guard against the sudden 
 changes of temperature out of doors, and at tho same time 
 to keep up as moist and warm a state of the atmosphere 
 within the vinery as is consistent with pretty freo admission 
 of the air during sunshine, is the great object of culture in 
 a vinery of this kind. 

Thinning the fruit is a very necessary practice in all 
 vineries — and on it depends greatly the flavor, as well as 
 the fine appearance and size of the berries and bunches.
