The first thinning usually consists in taking off all super- 
 fluous blossom buds, leaving only one bunch in the large 
 sorts or two in the small ones to each bearing shoot. The 
 next thinning takes place when the berries are set and well 
 formed, and is performed with a pair of scissors, taking care 
 not to touch the berries that are left to grow. All this time, 
 one-third of the berries should be taken off with the point 
 of the scissors, especially those in the centre of the cluster. 
 This allows the remainder to swell to double the size, and 
 also to form larger bunches than would otherwise be produ- 
 ced. Where the bunches are large, the shoulders should be 
 suspended from the trellis by threads, in order to take off 
 part of the weight from the stem of the vine. ' The last 
 thinning, which is done chiefly to regulato the form of the 
 bunch, is done by many gardeners, just before the fruit 
 begins to color — but it is scarcely needed if the previous 
 thinning of the berries has been thoroughly done. — Downing. 

On the Impoverishment of Land. 
 Wo are all too apt to blame nature, entirely too much, for 
 our own bad management. For instance, we say, Nature 
 has formed certain crops, or plants, which are calculated to 
 impoverish and waste the soil. Such is not the case; but 
 man's waste and mal-practice exhausts the soil. But, you 
 will inquire, "Does not oats and buckwheat exhaust the 
 land ?" My reply is, no; both oats and buckwheat are plants 
 of quick growth, and shallow and fibrous roots, consequently 
 having but a short time to take much from the atmosphere, 
 and being shallow rooted, are limited in their supplies, and 
 have to take what food they can get from the surface of the 
 land, (and hence is the reason that they are good for eradi- 
 cating weeds, briers and other rubbish,) while the greatest 
 waste and exhausting of the land lies in the mode in which 
 it is cultivated. For instance, in the crops above mentioned, 
 the ground is broken up or plowed at just such a time when 
 the rays of the sun have the greatest power for drying up 
 land, and drawing up, or evaporating, ammonia and all other 
 gasses which are absolutely necessary to vegetable life ; and 
 each shower of rain that falls, makes those gasses more so- 
 luble and more easily to be evaporated; so that the land, 
 being exposed, looses more by evaporation than is necessary 
 to support the plant. But the ground is not merely exposed 
 for one season, but nearly invariably, for two or more, as 
 your oat field of this season was your corn field of the year 
 before, consequently, it was so plowed and so cultivated as 
 to afford the sun's rays the greatest facility to penetrate the 
 earth and evaporate tho gasses, and then left bare all win- 
 ter for the frost to do its work of destruction, and again 
 re -plowed in the spring, and again left bare until the oats 
 have attained a sufficient growth to shade it, and just at the 
 time that it requires the shade the most, the oats are cut, 
 and it is again left exposed and the plow once more started, 
 to prepare the ground for wheat. Now, I do not say that 
 that exposure of the ground can be entirely avoided, but 
 still it might to a great extent, if the practice of sowing 
 clover, whenever possible, was more generally adopted. For 
 instance, when a corn field was worked for the last time, 
 clover might be sown' thiclc amongst the corn, and by the 
 time the corn would be cut off, the clover would have at- 
 tained a sufficient growth to cover the ground and not only 
 keep it warm in winter and prevent evaporation, but would 
 make a very nice coating to plough in the following spring. 
 Besides, clover is tho best live mulching, (for you can call it 
 nothing else,) it having the property of living more from 
 the atmosphere than from the soil, and by its long tap-root 
 penetrating deep into the soil, conveys the ammonia and 
 disperses it to a great depth. (Hence is the reason that 
 clover and plaster, or clover and charcoal, improve the 

ground; for as the clover draws tho ammonia from the atmos- 
 phere to, or in the soil, the plaster or charcoal absorbs it, 
 and in return throws it out into the soil.) 

But to return. We all know (if we will but give ourselves 
 time to think,) that Nature does not exhaust the soil. For 
 instance, whero a forest is cleared off, that has stood for 
 centuries, and thousands of tons have stood and grown on 
 an acre, that, in place of the soil being worn out, it is the 
 very richost of soils. And again, lot a fence be run across 
 a poor barren field, and in the course of a few years, that 
 fence row will be the richest part in the field. Simply that 
 from two or three feet each side of the fence is never plowed 
 and seldom or never cleared or mowed of its spontaneous 
 growth of grass, weeds, briers, &c, which act as mulching 
 in two ways. — First, that while in' the growing state they 
 shade tho ground from the scorching sun, consequently 
 keeping the ground moist and preventing evaporation ; and 
 in winter, most of the tops of which die, and are by the rain 
 and snow borne down and flattened to the ground, and 
 therein preserve evaporation and form a second mulching. 
 Still to prove more explicitly the great benefit of mulching, 
 lay a board on the ground and allow it to lay over night 
 when the Thermometer is, say about 20°, and the next morn- 
 ing, by turning it over, you will find tho under side white 
 with frost. The query would arise, what is this frost? and 
 where did it come from? The answer is, it is tho evapora- 
 tion from the ground of the essential gassos caught by the 
 board and there frozen, and when thawed, descends again to 
 the ground; whereas, if the board had not been there, it 
 would have been lost in the atmosphere, thus, jalainly show- 
 ing the constant evaporation that is going on from ground 
 that is left bare and exposed. Consequently, the too often 
 custom of ploughing the next season's corn ground in winter, 
 must be, and is, most ruinous to the ground, for more es- 
 capes by evaporation between the time it is ploughed and 
 the time it is planted, of its fertility, than would bo required 
 to raise the crop of corn. 

Many more proofs could be advanced to show clearly the 
 great waste of the fertility of land by exposure, and vice 
 versa, viz., that by covering up or hiding the laud from the 
 light, and consequently from the sun's rays, not only im- 
 proves it, but, in course of time, it will become immensely 
 rich. As an example, who ever knew an old building (one 
 that had no cellar under it,) removed, and did not find the 
 ground under it rich in the extreme, and if ploughed up 
 produce the finest crop of any part of the field. And again, 
 look at the prairies, fertile in the extreme, after producing 
 and bearing, year after year, from time immemorial, tons of 
 vegetation. That of itself would prove most clearly, two 
 points, first, the great benefit of mulching, and secondly, 
 that nature does not waste or impoverish the soil. If man 
 would only study to follow and assist nature, instead of 
 going, as he does, directly against her, it would be much 
 better for him in every respect. — F. R. Garden's Note Book. 

Wash, for Fruit Trees. 
 I have found the following a certain antidote for insects, or 
 fungus, on vines and fruit trees : — 1 lb. sulphur, 2 lbs. soft 
 soap, 1 gallon tobacco water, and 2 gallons lime water; mix. 
 To paint over all the wood. — W. Collins, M. R. C. S.,

Value of a Pound of the Finest Flax Thread. 
 A single pound of flaxen thread, intended for the finest 
 specimens of French lace, is valued at six hundred dollars, 
 and the length of the thread is about two hundred and 
 twenty-six miles. One pound of this thread is more valuable 
 than two pounds of gold.
