Munn's' Practical Land Draining. 
 We have not met for a long time, with a more seasonable, 
 and so far as we have examined, a more valuable agricultural 
 work than the above, just issued by Saxton, of New York. 
 Farmers are now being so thoroughly awakened to the im- 
 portance of draining their land, that it will be sought for 
 with unusual interest. The author, B. Munn, has some 
 celebrity as a landscape gardener, and appears to be entirely 
 at home in treating his present subject. We give on this 
 page, the introduction, with explanatory cuts, as preliminary 
 to the practical portions, in two parts. Part 1, of the "prin- 
 ciples and system of drainage," under its different heads 
 of "examination of land requiring drainage," the "various 
 systems of drainage," "deep drainage," thorough and surface 
 drainage, Ac. Part 2, of "levelling," "description of diff- 
 erent kinds of drains," "materials," mode of cutting drains," 
 "building the ducts," "filling up," cost, &c, with tables for 
 measuring their solid contents. It is illustrated with nume- 
 rous cuts of draining implements, tiles, levelling instruments 
 and outlines to indicate the course of springs. Price only 
 fifty cents, for sale by Parry & M'Millan, Fourth and Ches- 
 nut streets, and at the agricultural warehouses in Philadel- 
 phia. We have no doubt of a very extensive demand for it. 

THE PHYSICAL LAWS ON WHICH THE DRAINAGE OF LAND 
 DEPENDS. 

The object sought by the drainage of land, being to re- 
 move water from it, it will be well to consider, 1st. — The 
 sources from which the water which we wish to drain away 
 is derived; and 2nd. — The natural laws to which water when 
 etill, and when in motion is subject. 

The operation of heat upon the waters of the ocean and 
 of the land is continuously producing evaporation, by means 
 of which large quantities of water are carried, in the shape 
 of vapor, into the elevated parts of the atmosphere, and are 
 there retained in an invisible form by the agency of elec- 
 tricity. When a change takes place in the electric equilib- 
 rium, clouds are formed from the water so raised, which, 
 becoming subject to the laws of physical attraction, are 
 thereby brought in contact with the mountains, and more 
 elevated parts of the earth's surface. Giving out part of 
 their heat, tbese clouds descend again upon the earth in the 
 form of rain, fog, or snow, according to the temperature, 
 and other meteorological conditions of the atmosphere. 
 Once again upon the surface of the earth, the water becomes 
 subject to its natural laws, and it sinks into the earth, runs 
 down the hill-side, or lays upon the surface, as it may hap- 
 pen from the physical condition of the particular place on 
 which it chances to fall. The water which sinks downward 
 through the soil, and that which is carried through the inter- 
 stices of rocks and mineral strata, obedient to the laws of 
 gravity and capillary attraction, is distributed beneath the 
 ground to a greater or less depth, until it moots with strata, 
 that it cannot penetrate; then it flows along such strata, 
 or accumulates in large bodies, either in hollow basins or 
 diffused through extensive tracts of the subsoil, until it finds 
 vent upon the surface in the shape of springs; or, in other 
 cases, by spreading over a large mass of soil it is held in 
 suspension by it in the same manner as by a sponge. The 
 land so saturated becomes unfit for the purposes of the 
 husbandman. 

The natural laws by which water is governed are embraced 
 by the two branches of science, called hydrostatics, which 
 treats of water in a state of rest, and hydraulics, which treats 
 of water when in motion. It is only requisite for the present 
 purpose to state shortly some of the laws of these sciences, 
 without presenting, except so far as necessary for explana- 
 tion, the proofs by which the laws themselves are evidenced: 

First. — Water and all fluids, both liquid and gaseous, 
 when at rest, press equally in all directions. This results 
 from the extreme minuteness of the particles. 

Second. — The pressure of a column of water upon ita 
 base depends upon its height and the area of the base; and 
 not upon the thickness or width of the column. 

Suppose a and b, Fig. 1, to represent two vessels of equal 
 height and capacity. The pressure upon the bottom of a will 
 be much less than that on the bottom of b. The pressure on 

Figure 1. 

a, at the bottom, will be equal to a column of water repre- 
 sented by the dotted lines, but the pressure on b at the bot- 
 tom will be equal to a column of water of the size of the 
 whole base of b. 

The pressure of water in proportion to its height upon a 
 level base is exemplified at c, Fig. 1. If a vessel of water 
 be supposed to be divided into four, or any number of equal 
 parts vertically, the pressure upon any part is represented 
 by the sum of the aggregate addition of the parts above. 
 Thus, if the divisions are one foot apart, the pressure at the 
 first division will be equal to a column of water one foot 
 high, at the second division to a column two feet high, and 
 so on. 

Third. — Water at rest, and exposed on all parts of ita 
 surface to an equal atmospheric pressure, always stands at a 
 uniform level, whatever be its shape or magnitude. In Fig. 
 2, the size of the two parts of the vessel are very different; 
 but if water is poured into either end, and the surface of the 
 water is left exposed to the atmosphere, it will rise in both 
 sides to the same level. It is this law (in connection with 
 the law of gravity) that causes rivers to flow, and water to 
 percolate through the earth. 

From this property of water arises one of the chief causes 
 of springs. It will be an evident consequence of the 
 first two laws above stated, that if water be accumulated in 
 Figure 2. 

mass within a mountain or hill-side, beneath the surfaee, 
 and it finds egress by a narrow confined passage at a lower 
 elevation, that the force with which it will issue from its 
 lower orifice will be in proportion to the distance it has de- 
 scended; in other words, in proportion to the pressure of the 
 superincumbent vertical column of water above it; and 
 thence arises the cause of the fountain jet. When, therefore, 
 in draining, a spring is dug into, and the water spouts up 
 with violence, the source of it must be sought for in higher 
 ground,, either near or distant. For, in some geological 
 formations the water may travel far beneath the surface. 

Fourth— Capillary Attraction. This may be termed a 
 law of the science under consideration, although it is fre- 
 quently regarded in connection with the general properties 
 of Matter. And it merits attention from the two-fold reason
