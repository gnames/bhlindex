Hence it has been concluded (erroneously, I believe), that 
 the presence of bases exercises no particular influence upon 
 the growth of plants; but even were this view correct, it 
 jnust be considered as a most remarkable accident, that those 
 same analyses furnish proof for the very opposite opinion. 
 For although the composition of tho ashes of these pine 
 trees was so very different, they contained, according to the 
 analysis of De Saussure, an equal number of equivalents of 
 metallic oxides; or, what is the same thing, the quantity of 
 oxygen contained in all the bases was in both cases the same. 

100 parts of the ashes of tho pine tree from Mont Breven 

contained : 

Carbonate of Potash 3 GO Quantity of Oxygen in the Potash 0.41 

Lime 46.34 " " " Lime 7.33 

" Magnesia 6.77 " " " Magnesia 1.27 

Sum of the carbonates 56.71 Sum of the oxygen in the bases 9.01 

100 parts of the ashes of the pine from Mont La Salle 

contained :

 51.19 " " " Lime 8.10 

00.00 

Sum of the carbonates 58-55 Sum of the oxygen in the bases 8.95 

The numbers 9.01 and 8,95 resemble each other as nearly 

as could be expected even in analysis made for the purpose 

of ascertaining the fact above demonstrated, which the 

analyst in this case had not in view. 

Let us compare Berthier's analysis of the ashes of two fir 

trees, one of which grew in Norway, the other in Allevard 

(department de l'Isere). One contained fifty, the other 

twenty-five per cent, of soluble salts. A greater difference 

in the proportion of the alkaline bases could scarcely exist 

between two totally different plants, and yet even here, the 

quantity of oxygen in the bases of both was the same. 

100 parts of the ashes of firwood from Allevard contained 

according to Berthier, (Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. t. xxxii. 

p. 248,) 

Potash and Soda 16.8 in which 3-42 parts must be oxygen. 
 Lime 295 " 8.20 " 

Magnesia 32 " 1.20 " " 

49 5 12.82 

Only part of the potash and soda in these ashes was in 
 combination with organic acids, the remainder was in the 
 form of sulphates, phosphates, and chlorides. One hundred 
 parts of these contained 3.1 sulphuric acid, 4.2 phosphoric 
 acid, and 0.3 hydrochloric acid, which, together, neutralize 
 a quantity of base containing 1.20 oxygen. This number, 
 therefore, must be substracted from 12.82. The remainder 
 11.62 indicates the quantity of oxygen in the alkaline bases, 
 combined with organic acids, in the firwood of Allevard. 

The firwood of Norway contained in 100 parts : 

Potash - 14.10 of which 2.40 parts would be oxygen- 
 Soda - 20.70 " 5.'0 " 
 Lime - 12 30 " 3.45 " " 
 Magnesia - 4.35 " 1.69 " " 

5145 12.84 

And if the quantity of oxygen in the bases in combination 
 with sulphuric and phosphoric acid, viz. 1.37, be again sub- 
 tracted from 12.84, 11.47 parts remain as the amount of ox- 
 ygen contained in the bases which were in combination with 
 organic acids. 

These remarkable approximations cannot be accidental ; 
 and if further examinations confirm them in other kinds of 
 plants, no other explanation than that already given can be 
 adopted. — Liebig. 

Improved Cattle for the Dairy. 
 We gave last week a letter from Mr. Fish, of New York, 
 on the subject of improved cattle for dairy stock. We now 
 give some interesting statements condensed from a commu- 
 nication of Geo. Vail, Esq., of Troy, N. Y., a gentleman well 
 known as one of the earliest importers, and most careful 

breeders in this country. Mr. Vail for a number of years 
 imported and bred Shorthorns exclusively, but as his farm 
 was not well adapted to grazing, and after fully proving 
 what might be done with that class of cattle, he sold his 
 herd in 1852, at prices ranging from $300 to $670, except 
 some inferior and younger ones which sold for less. 

Being partial to improved stock, he has, since his sale, 
 been getting by importation, and selection in this country, a 
 small and excellent herd of Devons. He says: — "This breed 
 of cattle is my choice next to Durhams. So far as I have 
 tried them, I am of the opinion, that when placed in locali- 
 ties where pasture is abundant, they may prove profitable to 
 the breeder. The sprightly action, uniform color, and fine 
 symmetry of tho Devons, added to their intrinsic value, will 
 render them popular when they become known." 

(Mr. VaiFs communication is in reply to one from Dr. 
 Sprague, our State Secretary, and may be found at length, 
 in the Ohio Agricultural Report for 1854, which will be 
 issued in a few days.) Mr. Vail continues : — "You ask if 
 for the small farmer either of the improved breeds of cattle 
 will meet the public expectation, when we breed for milk 
 and fattening qualities in the same animal, or whether a 
 cross. with the Holderness, or other breeds, would improve 
 their qualities for all uses ? 

"In answering this question, I will premise by saying, I 
 am aware that many Durhams have been bred with special 
 reference to their aptitude to take on flesh, without much 
 regard to their milking qualities, consequently many of these 
 are unfitted for the dairy. 

"There are, however, families, or tribes of Durhams. pos- 
 sessing superior dairy qualities, and when no longer useful 
 as milkers, on account of age, or other causes, may be turned 
 off, and will then take on flesh about as rapidly as those 
 which are bred exclusively for the butcher. 

"If I am correct in this opinion, then I am prepared to 
 hazard the assertion, that no useful result can be arrived at 
 by crossing the Shorthorn cow with any other breed, with 
 the prospect of improving upon the dairy qualities of the 
 best milking families or tribes of Shorthorns which may be 
 procured in this country. 

"That there are tribes of such Shorthorns, that are not 
 inferior to tho best native dairy stock in the country, I think 
 there cannot be a doubt. If so, then it is obvious that it 
 would bo a waste of time to attempt to rear a new breed of 
 cattle for dairy purposes, as such experiments would occupy 
 many years to test their utility, it is believed that no prac- 
 tical breeder would attempt it. 

"I now proceed to show, that there are specimens among 
 Shorthorns of this country, which are superior to most if 
 not all of the breeds of this country, for dairy purposes. 

"In 1844, the New York State Agricultural Society offered 
 a premium for the largest quantity of butter, to be the pro- 
 duct of six cows, of any breed, in thirty consecutive days, 
 the cows to bo kept upon grass pasture, or green fodder, and 
 not to be allowed slops or other feed for thirty days previous 
 to, and during the trial. In order to test tho dairy qualities 
 of the Shorthorns, compared with other breeds, and thus 
 give the great dairy interests of the country an opportunity 
 to form a judgement of the relative merits of the different 
 breeds of cattle for dairy purposes, I put six Shorthorns on 
 trial, and kept them on grass alone, and the result was, they 
 produced in thirty days, 262 lbs. and 9 oz. of butter, it 
 being an average of 43 lbs. 12 oz., to each cow. To ascertain 
 the quantity of milk tho six cows gave, I carefully weighed 
 and measured the milk drawn from them in one day, and 
 the restflt was a weight of 265 lbs. 10 oz., and measured 134 
 quarts, wine measure, averaging 22J quarts per day. 

"It is proper to state that I had twelve cows, from which
