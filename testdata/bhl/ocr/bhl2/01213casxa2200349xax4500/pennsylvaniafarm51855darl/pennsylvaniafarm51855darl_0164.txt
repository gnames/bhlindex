queens for swarming. But when all the bees can be 
 profitably engaged in the body of the hive, more room is 
 unnecessary. 

Making Holes After the Hive is Full: — Whenever 
 it is required to put boxes on a hive that has no holes 
 through the top, it need not prevent your getting a few 
 pounds of the purest honey that may be had, just as 
 well as to have a portion of the bees idle. I always en- 
 deavor to ascertain in what direction the sheets of comb 
 are made, and then mark off the row of holes on the top 
 at right angles with them. 

Advantage of Proper Arrangement: — Two inches 
 being nearly the right distance, each one will be so made 
 that a bee arriving at the top of the hive between any 
 two sheets will be able to find a passage into the box, 
 without the task of a long search for it ; which I can im- 
 agine to be the case when only one hole for a passage is 
 made, or when the row of holes is parallel with the 
 combs. A hive might contain eight or ten sheets of 
 comb, and a bee desirous of entering the box might go up 
 between any two, many times, before it found the passage. 
 It has been urged that every bee soon learns all pass- 
 ages and places about the hive, and consequently will 
 know the direct road to the box. This may be true but 
 when we recollect that all within the hive is perfect dark- 
 ness — that this path must be found by the sense of feel- 
 ing alone — that this sense must be its guide in all its fu- 
 ture travels — that perhaps a thousand or two young 
 workers are added every week, and these have to learn 
 by the same means — it would seem, if we studied our own 
 interest, we would give them all the facility possible for 
 entering the boxes. What way so easy for them as to 
 have a passage, when they get to the top, between each 
 comb? That bees do not know all roads about the hive, 
 can be partially proved by opening the door of a glass 
 hive. Most of the bees about leaving, instead of going 
 to the bottom for their exit, where they have departed 
 many times, seem to know nothing of the way, but vainly 
 try to get out through the glass whenever light is admit- 
 ted. 

I am so well convinced of this that I take some pains 
 to accommodate them with a passage between each 
 comb; they will then at least lose no time by mistakes 
 between the wrong combs, crowding and elbowing their 
 way back through a dense mass of bees which impede 
 every step, until again at the top, perhaps between 
 the same combs, perhaps right, perhaps farther off than 
 at first ; when I suppose they try it again, as boxes are 
 filled sometimes under just such circumstances. 

To assist them as much as possible, when new hives 
 are used for swarms, I wait till the hive is nearly filled 
 before making the holes to ascertain the direction of the 
 combs. We all know it is uncertain which way the 
 combs will be built, when the swarm is put in, unless 
 guide-combs are used. When holes are made before 
 the bees are put in, guide-combs as directed for boxes 
 should be put in; (of course they should cross at right 
 angles the row of holes.) — M. Quinby. 

Test for the Expediency of Drainage. 
 John Johnson, of Seneca county, New York, gives in 
 the American Agriculturist the following plan to ascertain 
 whether land needs draining: — "Dig holes about two and 

a half feet deep in different parts of the field ; put a 
 cover over the holes so that the rainwater cannot get into 
 them, and if they fill with water until within a foot or so 
 of the surface, in ten or twelve hours, then his land re- 
 quires, and will pay well for draining. I think I hear F. 
 I. B., and many others say, that these holes will fill up on 
 any land, if the ground is wet at the time. But I tell them 
 it is not the case. You may dig as many drains as you 
 please on dry lands, and they will never run water un- 
 less the snow is melting on the surface. If F. I. B. had 
 stood over the making of between forty and fifty miles of 
 drains, as I have done, he would be a better judge of 
 what was wet and what was dry land. To the unprac- 
 tised eye, land that looks dry, is gorged with water six 
 inches below the surface."

Pear Tree Insects. — Those most injurious to this 
 tree are the Slug-worms, which destroy the leaves, the 
 Scotytus or Tomicus, referred to in a preceding paragraph, 
 and borers, which make their attacks on the stocks of 
 dwarf trees that are grafted upon the quince. Pear trees 
 likewise suffer occasonally from bark-lice. Within a few 
 years, a new and probably introduced insect has made its 
 appearance in great numbers on pear trees in the western 
 parts of Connecticut and of Massachussets, particularly 
 in the valley of the Housatonic, and in the adjacent 
 counties of Duchess and Columbia in New York. This 
 is 

The Psylla, or jumping louse, which is probably iden- 
 tical with the same species that infests the pear tree in 
 Europe. Some account has been given of it in the sec- 
 ond edition of my "Treatise :" but the history is confess- 
 edly incomplete, and further particulars have been hoped 
 for from Mr. T. Glover, of Fishkill Landing, whose op- 
 portunities for observing the habits of the insect are 
 greater than mine have been. In some of its forms it is 
 found on pear trees from May to October, and probably 
 two or more broods are produced every year. These 
 little insects live by suction, and obtain their food by 
 puncturing the bark of young shoots, mostly in the vicin- 
 ity of the buds. They defile the shoots with the fluid 
 which they discharge in large quantities, and which soon 
 forms a blackish crust on the bark. The best remedy 
 that occurs to me is a wash of strong soap suds and sul- 
 phur, applied with a brush to the branches in the spring, 
 before, the buds expand. A solution of whale oil soap, 
 thrown upon the trees, will kill the insects, but will 
 have to be repeated at intervals through the summer. 

Plum Tree Insects. — The Plum Weevil, Cureulio, or 
 Conotrachelus Nenuphar, continues to baffle all attempts 
 to exterminate it. Cherries, apples, pears, peaches, and 
 even the succulent warts of the plum tree provide for it 
 abundant resources, in default of plums, its more appro- 
 priate food. We may save a crop of plums by covering 
 the trees with fine netting or perhaps by coating the 
 fruit with whitewash; but the other fruits above named 
 will suffer all the more for our pains, and will furnish 
 a numerous brood of depredators for the following year.
