School House Lane, six miles from Philadelphia. He 
 has several hundred yards of it growing in great luxuri- 
 ance, and the admiration of all who see it. It is about 
 four and a half feet high. Trimming is performed twice 
 a year. 

KETCHUM'S KEAPEB AND MOWER. 

The above engraving gives a representation of Ketch- 
 urn's mowiDg machine with the reaper attachment. The 
 change from a mower to a reaper is effected by simply 
 enlarging the main wheel by the addition of an outer 
 rim of sufficient thickness, which is easily attached by 
 bolts in sections. These are circular fitted and bolted 
 with one bolt. 

The advantages claimed for this arrangement are : — 

1st. Raising the cutters sufficiently high for cutting 
 grain. 

2d. Lessening the motion of the knives without any 
 change of gearing, which is desirable in cutting grain, 
 as much less motion is required than for grass. 

3d. Raising the cogs of the driving wheel, thereby 
 'preventing them from being filled with dirt. 

4th. Reducing the draft of the machine at least one- 
 third. 

6th. Attaining the above objects without complicating 
 the machinery, not a screw or bolt having to be changed. 

Ketchum's combined reaper and mower is all made of 
 iron, the frame and finger bar being of wrought iron. 
 Price in Philadelphia, $135. 

We are not aware of Ketchum's combined machine 
 having yet been tried in Pennsylvania, but it is said to 
 have been well tested in New York, and worked to entire 
 satisfaction, cutting from ten to fifteen acres of grain 
 per day. 

Patents on mowing and reaping machines are accu- 
 mulating rapidly. We have no interest in them, farther 
 than to keep our readers advised of improvements, and 
 of the peculiar arrangement of each, leaving to them 
 Entirely the decision of which is the best. The question 
 of which is the best mower, and which the best reaper, 
 has become one of the great questions of the day, at 
 least to the farming community. Even with all the dis- 
 advantages of their first season's trial, and the imper- 
 fection of their manufacture in many cases, there are 
 but few, if any farmers, who have tried them, who 
 would now be willing to go back to the old scythe and 
 cradle, or sickle. 

The two mowers which have been most generally used 
 in this section and most esteemed, are Ketchum's and 

Allen's. Several hundred of them were sold in Penn- 
 sylvania last season, and where they were well made, 
 gave, we believe, general satisfaction. The reputation 
 of Allen's machine has no doubt suffered by the very 
 imperfect manner in which many of them were manu- 
 factured — attributable in part to the very unexpected 
 demand, causing the materials to be gotten together too 
 hastily. These defects, we understand, are being fully 
 remedied the present season. 

The proprietor of Ketchum's patent having wisely re- 
 tained the right to manufacture in one or two hands, 
 they have proved more uniformly of good, durable con- 
 struction. All that have as yet been brought to this 
 market have been made at Buffalo. 

Any manufacturers of reaping or mowing machines 
 not hei-etofore described in the Farm Journal, can cheer- 
 fully have the benefit of a description and insertion of a 
 cut in our pages, which will be a benefit all around. 

SPAIN'S PATENT CHURN. 

We wish to be cautious of giving the sanction of the 
 Farm Journal to new and untried implements, or those of 
 doubtful character, and prefer that inventors or paten- 
 tees, in introducing their articles to the public, and 
 making use of our columns, which we cheerfully accord 
 in every case of probable merit or usefulness, should do 
 it in their own language, and on their own responsibili- 
 ty. We vouch for nothing we have not known and tried. 
 Spain 1 s patent atmospheric churn, of which the above en- 
 graving gives a pretty good representation, is one of the 
 articles we can recommend with entire confidence, from 
 our own knowledge, and from the experience of several 
 years trial in Philadelphia and adjoining counties. It 
 took the first premium at the last Pa. State Fair, has 
 been awarded, at different times, a silver medal from 
 the Franklin Institute of Pennsylvania, and has never yet 
 been exhibited in competition with others without receiv- 
 ing the first premium. The dashers are the patent- 
 able part of its construction, being so made as to give 
 a kind of transverse motion to the cream, keeping it con- 
 stantly agitated, and bringing every portion into succes- 
 sive contact with fresh particles of the atmosphere 
 through the open tube in the lid. They also can be lift- 
 ed out entire by unscrewing the handle, making the 
 cleansing much easier and more thorough. Persons have 
 frequently remarked to us of how much better quality 
 their butter was from this churn than others, and asked 
 for a reason. We presume the reason to be that while in 
 other churns, the fetid gas always generated by the
