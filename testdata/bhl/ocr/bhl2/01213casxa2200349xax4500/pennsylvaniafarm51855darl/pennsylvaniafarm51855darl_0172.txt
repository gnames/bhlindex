Pumpkins and Squashes. 

We know of no vegetable genus in which there is so 
 much confusion of names and characters among cultivators, 
 as the Pumpkin and Squash tribe, or Cucurbita of Botanists. 
 Their common names have so multiplied, that a farmer 
 wishing to grow some for his stock, or his table, can hardly 
 tell what to ask for at the seed stores, or what will be the 
 character of his crops when obtained. 

Knowing that T. W. Harris, the distinguished Entomolo- 
 gist of Massachusetts, had been paying special attention to 
 this subject, with the view to some reliable and scientific 
 classification, we addressed him tho following queries, to 
 which he has most kindly responded. 

To the Editor of the Farm Journal: â€” In your com- 
 munication, you request to be informed what is "the distinc- 
 tion, if any, between the Boston and Vegetable Marrow 
 Squash, also between the Connecticut Field Pumpkin and 
 the Cheese Pumpkin ; what is the Valparaizo Squash, and 
 is it a desirable variety; what are the distinctive marks of 
 the Winter and Summer Crook-neck Squash, Early Egg or 
 Apple Squash, Pattypan Squash, Turban Squash, Cashaw 
 Pumpkin, Mammoth Pumpkin, Acorn Squash ; what are the 
 correct names and synonymcs of these kinds; which of 
 them is most valued in New England for pumpkin pies, and 
 which for stock and field culture ?" 

In September, 1834, Mr. John M. Ives, of Salem, Mass., 
 exhibited in Faneuil Hall, Boston, a new squash, to which 
 he subsequently gave the name of the "Autumnal Marrow 
 Squash." It was figured and described in Fessenden's 
 New England Farmer, vol. XIII, No. 16, Oct. 29, 1834, page 
 122, and again in Fessenden and Teschemacher's Horticul- 
 ral Register, vol. I, No. 3, March, 1835, page 93. This fruit 
 thus introduced and brought into notice, soon became a 
 great favorite, and has ever since been extensively cultiva 
 ted for table use, as a sauce and for pies, in the vicinity of 
 Boston. So popular has it become in the market of Boston, 
 that it may well be called "the Boston Squash," though I 
 never heard that name applied to it. Mr. Ives, in his de- 
 scription of it, called it a variety of Cucurbita melopepo, 
 which is an error. If not a mere variety of Commodore 
 Porter's Valparaiso Squash, it doubtless descended from the 
 same stock as the latter. It must not be confounded with 
 the kind cultivated in England under the name of "Vegeta- 
 ble Marrow," a very poor vegetable, as I am assured by 
 friends who have eaten it in London, and apparently one of 
 the sorts which in New England would be called Summer 
 Squashes. The "Autumnal Marrow" is eaten only when 
 fully ripe ; the "Vegetable Marrow," like your "Cymlings," 
 is eaten only in unripe state. The former comes into eating 
 in September, but may be kept with care till March. When 
 pure or unmixed by crossing with other kinds, it is consid- 
 ered as the very best autumnal and winter squash in New 
 England. Many cultivators have allowed it to degenerate 
 or becomo mixed with the larger and grosser Valparaiso, so 
 that we do not often find it in entire purity in our markets. 
 It generally has only three double rows of seeds. For a de- 
 scription of it, see the works before cited, also Cole's New 
 England Farmer, vol. I, No. 12, May 26, 1849, p. 185. 

I am not sure what is the fruit denominated Connecticut 
 Field Pumpkin, and the Cheese Pumpkin is unknown to me 
 except by its name in catalogues. 

The Valparaizo Squashes, of which there seem to bo sev- 
 eral varieties, known to cultivators by many different 
 names, some of them merely local in their application, be- 
 long to a peculiar group of the genus Cucurbita, the distin- 
 guishing characters of which have not been fully described 
 by botanists. The word squash as applied to these fruits is 
 a misnomer, as may bo shown hereafter ; it would be well 

to drop it entirely, and to call the fruits of this group pora- 
 pions, pumpkins, or potirons. It is my belief that they 
 were originally indigenous to the tropical and subtropical 
 parts of the western coast of America; they are extensively 
 cultivated from Chili to California, and also in the West In- 
 dies, whence enormous specimens are sometimes brought to 
 the Atlantic States. How much soever these Valparaizo 
 pumpkins may differ in form, size, color, and quality, 
 they all agree in certain peculiarities that are found in 
 no other species or varieties of Cucurbita. Their leaves 
 are never deeply lobed like those of other pumpkins 
 and squashes, but are more or less five-angled, or al- 
 most rounded, and heart shaped at base; they are also 
 softer than those of other pumpkins and squashes. The 
 summit or blossom-end of the fruit has a nipple-like projec- 
 tion upon it, consisting of the permanent fleshy stile. The 
 fruit-stalk is short, nearly cylindrical, never deeply five- 
 furrowed, but merely longitudinally striated or wrinkled, 
 and never clavated or enlarged with projecting angles next 
 to the fruit. With few exceptions, they contain four or five 
 double row of seeds. To this group belong Mr. Ives' Au- 
 tumnal Marrow squash (or pumpkin) before namod, Com- 
 modore Porter's Valparaizo squash (pumpkin), the so called 
 Mammoth pumpkin or Cucurbita maxima of the botanists, 
 the Turban squash or Acorn squash, Cucurbita piliformia of 
 Duchesne, the Cashew pumpkin, Cole's Connecticut pie 
 squash, Stetson's Cuba squash, and his hybrid called the 
 Wilder squash, with various others. 

The variety introduced from Valparaizo by Commodore 
 Porter, became known to me about the year 1830, since 
 which time it has been more or less cultivated in New Eng- 
 land both for the table and for stock. It is of an oblong 
 oval shape, of a pale reddish yellow color externally when 
 ripe, nearly smooth, and very slightly furrowed, and often 
 grows to a large size. It readily mixes with the Autumnal 
 Marrow, but is inferior to it in quality. It may prove bet- 
 ter and more valuable in the Middle and Southern States 
 than in New England. 

The Turban, sometimes called also the Acorn squash, be- 
 cause when the fruit is small it resembles somewhat an acorn 
 in its cup, seems to be the Cucurbita piliformia of Duchesne. 
 The middle lower figure of the group on page 283 of the 
 volume on "Timber Trees and Fruits," in the "Library of 
 Entertaining Knowledge," seems intended for the Turban 
 squash. It sometimes grows to a large size, measuring 14 
 or 15 inches,in transverse diameter, and looks like an im- 
 mense Turkish turban in shape. Specimens raised in my 
 garden in 1851 were little more than ten inches in diameter, 
 and weighed ten pounds or more, having very thick and 
 firm flesh, and but a small cavity within. They proved ex- 
 cellent for table use, equal in quality to the best Autumnal 
 Marrows. They keep quite as well as the latter. 

The earliest account of the Cashew pumpkin that has fal- 
 len under our notice, is contained in the English translation 
 of Du Pratz's History of Louisiana, (vol. II, p. 8), where it 
 is called Cushaw. In tho original French work, the name 
 given to it is Giromon. Du Pratz described two varieties ; 
 one round, and the other curved, or of the shape of a hun- 
 ter's horn. The latter was considered the best. The Cu- 
 shaw or Cashew pumpkin is not cultivated or much known 
 in New England. I raised some specimens of the crook- 
 necked variety, (which has only three double rows of seeds), 
 a few years ago, from seeds received from New Jersey. They 
 did not ripen well, and many of them rotted before half 
 ripe. They are evidently too tender for a New England cli- 
 mate. From the account given of them by Du Pratz, they 
 seem well suited to Louisiana, where they are much esteem- 
 ed. See his work.
