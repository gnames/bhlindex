Compost Heaps. 
 Br Mr. John Lockhart Morton, Civil and Agricul- 
 tural Engineer, Edinburgh. 

We copy the following valuable article for makiug 
 compost heaps from the Journal of the Highland Agri- 
 cultural Society, of Scotland. Its importance will repay 
 attentive perusal, and we think our readers will agree 
 with us, that it alone when finished will be worth far 
 more than a year's subsciption to the Farm Journal. 
 Manure is the foundation or basis of all good farming ; 
 it is the raw material from which the farmer manufac- 
 tures his crops, and upon which he obtains his profits. 
 Any information, therefore, how to increase the amount 
 and quality of the manure heap, constitutes the very el- 
 ement of successful and remunerative labor. The article 
 will be continued in another number : 

"In the autumn of 1842, the thought first occurred to 
 me that peat might be advantageously used in the pre- 
 paration of compost heaps. I had previously seen it ex- 
 tensively employed in the bottoms of dunghills, but, 
 from its being imperfectly dried, it did not appear to 
 undergo the changes necessary to render it a manure. 
 The summer and autumn of that year had been remark- 
 able for drought ; and even in October and November, 
 clay land, which had been under green crop, was so dry 
 and hard as to be almost incapable of being ploughed for 
 wheat. This weather was in every respect favourable 
 for drying, carting, and mixing peat in compost heaps. 
 At the distance of two miles there was an extensive peat 
 moss, easily accessible to carts, by barrows being used 
 for 20 or 30 yards. From a heap which had been pre- 
 viously wheeled out to dry, consisting partly of black, 
 solid peaty matter, and partly of floated moss, a large 
 quantity was removed to pasture land, and laid down in 
 heaps, each containing about three cart-loads. To 
 each heap was next added a cart-load of lime-shells, and 
 while quite hot these were mixed with the peat — care 
 being taken to have the pieces of peat well broken, and 
 to keep a sufficient coating of moss on the outside, to 
 cover the lime properly. In the mixing operation, there 
 was first formed a circular layer of peat several inches 
 thick, and then over it was laid a thin coating of lime- 
 shells, continuing in this way to add moss and lime alter- 
 nately till the heap was completed in a rounded form. 
 As the moisture in the peat acted on the caustic lime and 
 produced a hydrate, a large amount of heat was genera- 
 ted. So hot indeed did the peat become, that it was im- 
 possible to hold the hand in it without being burned. 
 This species of fermentation of necessity caused the moss 
 11 

to liberate a quantity of carbonic acid, which, being taken 
 up by a part of the lime, converted it into a carbonate. 
 The lime also united with the humic and ulmic acids of 
 the peat, and formed humate and ulmate of lime, both 
 valuable fetilizers. These chemical changes will explain 
 the beneficial results which followed the application of 
 the compost to the soil. After having lain for several 
 months it was applied to stiff clay land, on which hither- 
 to there had been very inferior crops. It was ploughed 
 in with a shallow furrow early in Feburary, the land 
 being sown soon after with oats, and in due time a heavy 
 and remunerative crop was obtained. The following year 
 it was under drilled beans ; and, in contrast to a similar 
 crop on land adjoining, naturally superior to it, the yield 
 was worth nearly the double by the acre. For several 
 years the land so treated produced remarkably produc- 
 tive crops ; and as the quantity of lime applied per acre 
 did not exceed five tons, it appeared conclusive that 
 peat, when properly prepared, becomes a valuable ma- 
 nure, especially in clay soils, where its mechanical as 
 well as its chemical action is of importance. The next 
 trial with a peat compound, which appears to be worth 
 mentioning — more for contrast than anything else — was 
 made in 1850, with a potato crop. I only regret that 
 the superiority of the peat mixture, for at least the first 
 crop, was so conclusive to my own mind, that it did not 
 appear necessary to test the respective crops by weight. 
 In a large ditch, into which the gutter drainings of a 
 considerable village are dischai'ged, if has been customa- 
 ry for many years to saturate a quantity of dried peat, 
 and by repeated turnings prepare it for use in the field. 
 In 1850, a quantity of peat so prepared was used in the 
 centre of a potato field, at the rate of about 30 tons to 
 the acre. During the summer the foliage of the plants 
 manured in this way was a much darker green in colour, 
 and the stems were stronger than in other parts of the 
 field. In antumn it was found that the tubers were nu- 
 merous and large, but inferior for table use, though ex- 
 cellent for seed. In this case the yield from the peat- 
 manured land was at least one-half larger than from the 
 land dressed with farmyard manures. I found, however, 
 that moss so treated is best adapted to a single crop, for 
 unless very dry when first saturated, it does little more 
 than act as an absorbent of the sewerage-water run over 
 it. The action in this case, then, was altogether differ- 
 ent from that of the lime compound. The preparation 
 of the mixture, in the latter case necessarily brought 
 about a reduction of the inert matter which the moss con- 
 tained, and made it capable of nourishing plant life. In
