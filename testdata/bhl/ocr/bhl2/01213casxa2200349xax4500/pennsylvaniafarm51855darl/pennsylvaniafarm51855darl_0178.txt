6 feet deep, or cast into some out-of-the-way pit, where 
 they can serve no useful purpose whatever? Almost 
 every farmer, it is to be feared, has now and then dead 
 beasts about his place ; and though the carcass should be 
 that of any of the smallest domesticated animals, still, 
 if converted into a manure, each one possesses a money 
 value which should not be despised. Here, then, are 
 two of the refuse matters of the farm which may be ad- 
 vantageously used together — (1), the cleanings of roads 
 and ditches, available in almost every case, and (2), the 
 carcasses of dead animals, obtainable in more cases than 
 could be wished, both of them rendered of greater fer- 
 tilizing value by being mixed together. But the refuse 
 earthy matters of the farm are of use for many different 
 sorts of composts ; and, in our subsequent remarks on 
 these, we shall use the term earth and soil as signifying 
 such matters acting the part of absorbents in the pre- 
 paration of the more potent fertilizers. 

Report on Some of the Diseases and Insects Affecting 

Fruit Trees and Vines. 

[Concluded from page 150.] 

Insects of the Grape Vine: — The vine is subject to 
 the attacks of a very great variety of insects, differing 
 also from each other in their opei-ations, and in the 
 amount of injury done by them. Most of them have been 
 noticed in my "Treatise" on injurious insects; but there 
 are others claiming the attention of the cultivator and of 
 the naturalist. 

Grape Vine Borer : — The roots of cultivated grape 
 vines in the Southern States have been observed, by Dr. 
 F. J. Kron, of Albemarle, North Carolina, to be so much 
 injured by borers as to prevent the ripening of the fruit, 
 and finally to cause the decay and death of the vines. 
 The insects do not even spare the native varieties, all of 
 which, except only the scuppernong or muscadine, are 
 found to be attacked by them. Taking advantage of the 
 foregoing exemption, Dr. Kron, has been successfully en- 
 grafting and cultivating the best foreign and native grapes 
 on stocks of the wild muscadine, probably the true Vitis 
 Vulpina of Linnaeus, and of Sir J. E. Smith, in Abbot's 
 "Insects of Georgia," and identical with the Vitis rotun- 
 difolia, of Michaux and of Elliott. He has also favored 
 me with samples of injured vine-roots, and specimens of 
 tlie insects in all their stages, together with an account 
 of his observations and experiments upon them. This 
 account, and a scientific description of the insects written 
 by me at the request of Dr. Kron, have been published 
 in the Raleigh Register for the 5th of April, 1854. The 
 insects belong to the genus JEgeria, and are allied to the 
 borers of the peach tree, and to those that destroy the 
 roots of pumpkin and squash vines. In their winged 
 form they strikingly resemble certain wasps called Polis- 
 tes; hence I have given to this species the name of 
 JEgeria polisiiformis . According to Dr. Kron, they are 
 found about the vines, and on the wing from the middle 
 of June to the middle of September, during which time 
 they couple and lay their eggs. These winged insects 
 are of a dark brown color, more or less tinged with a 
 tawny orange on the sides, and banded with bright yellow 
 upon the edge of the second ring of the hind-body. The 
 thorax and shoulder-covers, and the fourth ring, are more 
 faintly edged with yellow or with tawny orange. The 

feelers, antennae beneath, and legs are also orange color- 
 ed. The fore-wings are dusky; the hind-wings are 
 transparent, but veined and edged with black. The fe- 
 male has a little orange colored tuft on each side of the 
 tail, and the males have two tufts on each side, the 
 middle pair longer than the others. The males are more 
 numerous, more active, and smaller than the females ; 
 they measure from five to six-tenths of an inch in length, 
 and their wings expand from one inch to one inch and 
 three-twentieths. The body of the female varies from 
 six to nine-tenths of an inch in length, and her wings ex- 
 pand from one inch to one inch and a half. These insects 
 lay their eggs near the roots of the vines, and the whitish 
 grubs, hatched therefrom, of various sizes will be found 
 boring into the bark and wood of the roots during the 
 summer. When fully grown, these grubs measure from 
 one inch to one inch and three quarters in length. They 
 undergo their transformations in oblong oval pods, 
 formed of a gummy kind of silk, covered with fragments 
 of wood, bark and dirt, which will be found within or ad- 
 jacent to the injured roots. The insects take the chry- 
 salis form at various times during the summer. The rings 
 of the chrysalis are surrounded with minute teeth, which 
 assist the insect in coming forth from its pod or cocoon 
 when about to be changed to a moth. 

Eight-spotted Sphinx, or Alypia octomaculata: — There 
 are two insects occasionally found on the grape vine, 
 which in their caterpillar state closely resemble each 
 other in form, size, color and habits. One of these is 
 the beautiful Eudryas, described in my "Treatise;" tho 
 other is the Sphinx or Alyjria, above named. This Alypia, 
 though common and occasionally so numerous as to be 
 quite hurtful to the vine in some parts of the United 
 States, is very rare in New England. I never saw it in 
 Massachusetts until the summer of 1853, when a few spe- 
 cimens were discovered on my grape vines ; and during 
 the past summer they have appeared in greater numbers 
 on the same vines. At first they were mistaken for the 
 caterpillars of the Eudryas, from which, however, they 
 are to be distinguished by having a conspicuous white 
 spot on each side of the hinder part of the body. These 
 caterpillars are white, passing into blue, transversely 
 banded with narrow black lines, with a broader orange 
 colored band, dotted with black on the middle of each ring. 
 The head and feet are also orange, dotted with black. 
 The black dots on the body produce a few short whitish 
 hairs. They were found eating the leaves of the vine in 
 the latter part of June and beginning of July. Full 
 grown specimens measured one inch and a quarter, or 
 m^re, in length. Before the 16th of July, they left the 
 vines, and concealed themselves in a loose web upon the 
 surface of the ground, and soon took the chrysalis form. 
 One of them was transformed to a moth on the 10th of 
 August ; others remained in the chrysalis state through 
 the winter and came forth winged in May and June. 
 The winged insects are black, with two large yellow 
 spots on each of the fore-wings and two white ones on 
 the hind-wings. Their shanks are clothed with orange- 
 colored hairs. Their wings expand from one inch to one 
 inch and a half. Abbot has figured this insect in his 
 "Insect of Georgia;" but has colored the caterpillar in- ' 
 correctly.
