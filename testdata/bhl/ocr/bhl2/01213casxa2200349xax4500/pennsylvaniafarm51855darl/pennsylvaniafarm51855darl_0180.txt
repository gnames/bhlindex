A little reflection will satisfy the intelligent reader, 
 that by observing an alternation of crops, digging his 
 soil to a proper depth, and manuring it abundantly, he 
 need have no fear of its losing its fertility, or of his 
 choice vegetables degenerating. — Schenck's Garden Text

Transplanting Trees— Large and Small. 

A friend -was recently complaining to us of his bad 
 success in moving ornamental trees into his lawn, and 
 asked us to account for it. Out of over two hundred, 
 transplanted within the last two years, hardly six thrifty 
 ones were now alive. He had gone to extraordinary ex- 
 pense in digging very large holes, obtaining rich surface 
 soil, watered them with great labor, staked and tended 
 and mulched them, and yet they died. Our enquiries 
 elicited the secret of failure, viz: that he had gone to the 
 woods or clearing, for all the large and beautiful specimens 
 he could find, both of evergreen and deciduous trees, 
 thinking it unnecessary to go twenty miles to a nursery, 
 when better looking trees were growing close by. 

In our short experience we have often had occasion to 
 remark, to use a common expression, "there is a trade in 
 everything." There is an art, or science in every human 
 occupation, within the sphere of which only we must ex- 
 pect to find that accurate knowledge of details so essen- 
 tial to success. It is perhaps as unreasonable to expect 
 a citizen unaccustomed to the philosophy of planting trees 
 and to country life to understand it, as it would be to 
 expect a farmer to be posted up about the rise and fall 
 of "the funds, "and the variations of the cotton market. 
 The reason trees from the woods do not succeed is, be- 
 cause they have never been before transplanted ; in 
 other words they are deficient in fibrous roots around the 
 body of the tree. In their native locality, their fibres, 
 containing the little spongioles or mouths through which 
 food only is absotbed, exist at the extremities of the long 
 roots. As it is almost impossible to take these all up, the 
 very source of supply and support is cut off, and if the 
 tree should be able to barely live, it will be years before 
 new organs for supplying food can be re-formed. No 
 matter how rich and abundant the soil may be in the el- 
 ements of growth, there is but this one way provided by 
 nature for them to be absorbed. In nursery practice, 
 where trees are taken from their natural localities, they 
 are removed quite s?nall, and even then probably the loss 
 is fifty per cent., and much more with many varieties. 
 A small sized tree of one or two feet high can, of course, 
 be taken up with much less loss of fibre than a large 
 one ; the main roots being cut off there is an amount of 
 fibrous root remaining, which enables them to recover 
 speedily from the check to its growth and change of cir- 
 cumstances, and develope fresh organs of nutrition. Ev- 
 ery subsequent transplanting, and it has to undergo two 
 or three before final removal to its place in the row for 
 Bale as a tree, increases the formation of fibrous roots 
 and its probabilities of success when finally transplanted. 
 Frequent removal of trees and shrubs is therefore prac- 
 ticed in all good nurseries for this object. 

A mistake we think is often made by purchasers in 
 seeking for very large trees, even from the nurseries, in 
 the wish to procure fruit or shade without delay. We 
 are satisfied nothing is gained by it. A large tree trans- 

planted in the ordinary way may, and does often barely 
 live for years afterwards. It cannot grow and thrive till 
 thoroughly recovered from the necessarily great and vi- 
 olent interruption of its functions and organs of growth 
 and nutrition. It becomes effectually stunted, while a 
 small or young tree will hardly know the change, if prop- 
 er care is taken, and will continue growing and thriving. 
 The only effectual way to transplant large trees is by 
 the frozen ball method in the winter season. 

Natural History of New York, Vol. V. 

BY E. EMMONS, M. T>. 

Our last number contained a very able criticism on the 
 above volume, from one of our valued correspondents, 
 and an experienced entomologist. The many gross er- 
 rors and absudities, which he has pointed out, and which 
 have also been extensively criticised in the Progressive 
 Farmer and Philadelphia Florist, admit neither of denial 
 nor extenuation. They are matters of fact, too gross 
 and palpable to pass unnoticed, and we sincerely hope for 
 the credit of the great State of New York, and the scien- 
 tific reputation of the whole country, the edition of the 
 fifth volume, no matter what the cost may have been, 
 may be speedily called in and cancelled. The plagiarisms 
 of the work are discreditable in the highest degree to 
 the author, E. Emmons, Jr., and the many inaccuracies 
 are so palpable as to be almost ludicrous. Whatever 
 his ambition has been heretofore, his highest now should 
 be that the very memory of his attempt to illustrate our 
 local entomology should be forgotten, and not go down 
 to posterity. Were we in his situation, we should prefer 
 to sink a private fortune, if necessary, in the attempt to 
 destroy all traces of the fifth volume of the Natural 
 History of New York. It would occupy our thoughts by 
 day and our dreams by night, and we would take no rest 
 till it was a thing accomplished. We should then feel 
 safe, at least, in preserving our name from the indignant 
 censure of the future, and by going into retirement ten 
 years now should hope to escape the recollection of the 
 fifth volume even by the present generation. 

The Coming Crop in Western Pennsylvania. 
 A friend from the western part of the State writes as 
 follows: — "The crops in this region all look well, vary well; 
 and every farmer here has put in an extra acre, and still 
 the work goes on, for they are still plowing for a little 
 corn. The grass never looked better at this season, and 
 the clover that escaped the drouth of last summer looks 
 very well. With us there has been no clover fields 
 frozen out, the only damage they sustained was from 
 dry weather and not from frost. The excessive cold 
 and deep snows of the last winter have made fine 
 clover." 

Raising Calves on Sour Milk. 
 An article appeared in a recent Boston Cultivator on 
 raising calves, and as we see the process copied into sev- 
 eral of our agricultural exchanges, we call attention to 
 the subject chiefly for the benefit of our readers who 
 are not practical farmers. The latter will place a proper 
 estimate on this improved patent process for raising 
 calves. The writer recommends one-half new milk the 
 first month, one-fourth new milk the second, and after
