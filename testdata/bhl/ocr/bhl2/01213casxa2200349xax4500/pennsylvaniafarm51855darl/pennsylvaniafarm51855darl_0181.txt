that "sour milk, hay, and a few oats." The writer thinks 
 the alteration from sweet milk to sour is ver-y important 
 "to be made while the calf is drinking," and after he has 
 been" used to drinking sour milk, he will not touch sweet." 
 Very like!;/, and for the same reason, a horse fed for a 
 couple of months on oyster-shells and watermelon rinds 
 will not be in a condition to touch oats. When the calf 
 scours, (as he most certainly will,) it is recommended to 
 give it one or two doses of opium, as a certain cure. 
 Sour milk, whole oats and opium for calves ! ! It would 
 be rather a ludicrous picture to see two persons feeding 
 a calf on this plan, for it would require two, one to hold 
 the sour milk and pour it slily into the sweet milk while 
 it was drinking, so as to convey the impression to the 
 calf's mind that it had only got sweet milk, for the virtue 
 of the process would seem to consist in the calf's not 
 knowing the sour had been put in. Whether the calf's 
 stomach would not be likely to discover the imposition is 
 not stated by this learned writer, but in such an event, 
 no doubt the opium could correct any unpleasant conse- 
 quences, and soon put the calf to sleep. 

Seriously, we regret to see such matter in an agricul- 
 tural paper, and are reminded of the remark of an old 
 farmer, that only experienced and practical farmers 
 could safely subscribe for agricultural periodicals, "as 
 tLey alone know how to sift the wheat from the chaff." 
 We venture to say that a calf kept above ground for two 
 or three months on such a system, would not at the end 
 of that time cast a shadow. 

For very valuable and high priced stock, where the ex- 
 pense would be fully justified, there is no plan for raising 
 a good calf equal to buying a common cow, and let it run 
 with her and suck at pleasure. The cow can be turned 
 off for beef in the fall, when the calf will have a size, 
 strength and maturity, ready for the coming winter, un- 
 attainable by any other process. In ordinary cases 
 calves can be raised well, by taking them from the cow 
 at two or three days old, or so soon as the inflamation 
 of the cow's bag is reduced, feeding then! on fresh new 
 milk for the first month, with a trough at hand contain- 
 ing a little meal to lick at pleasure, and which, with a 
 little help at first it will soon learn to like. For the 
 second month it should have, at least, sweet skimmed 
 milk, access to some corn and oats ground, or meal and 
 bran, and soft hay, to be continued afterwards according 
 to circumstances. The calf suckler, described on another 
 page, will be found a useful and convenient auxiliary. In 
 addition to the above, a piece of soft pasture, and pure 
 water should be allowed at all times, as nature herself 
 suggests. Calves should be very early accustomed to 
 the halter. We have always tied up our young calves at 
 night in the stalls; and find the subjection when young 
 has the effect of making them more quiet and tractable 
 ever afterwards. 

Domestic Recipes. 
 Red Flummery: — Boil a pound of ground rice in as 
 much water as will cover it. When it is thoroughly 
 boiled and very thick and smooth, stir into the rice (while 
 hot) a half pound of powdered white sugar, and about 
 three gills, or six wine-glasses of fresh currant or cher- 
 ry juice that has been passed through a linen bag. 
 Next replace it on the fire, and boil the whole together 

for about ten minutes, stirring it well. Then put it into 
 moulds, and set it on ice. When cold turn it out and eat 
 it with sweetened cream, or with boiled custard. 

You may use the juice of fresh strawberries or rasp- 
 berries, stirred in while the flummery is hot, but not 
 boiled afterwards. The flavour of strawberries and 
 raspberries is always impaired and weakened by cooking. 

Rye Mush: — To make smooth rye mush, sift a quart 
 or more of rye meal into a pan, and gradually pour in 
 sufficient cold water to make a thick batter, stirring it 
 hard with a spoon as you proceed, and carefully pressing 
 out all the lumps against the side of the pan. Add a 
 very little salt. The batter must be so thick at the last 
 that you can scarcely stir it. Then thin it with a ltttle 
 more water and see that it is quite smooth. Rye, and 
 also wheat flour, have a disposition to be more lumpy 
 than corn meal, when made into mush. When thorough- 
 ly mixed and stirred, put it in a pot, place it over the 
 fire and boil it well, stirring it with a mush-stick till it 
 comes to a hard boil; then place it in a diminished heat, 
 and simmer it slowly till you want to dish it up. Eat it 
 warm with butter and molasses, or with sweet milk or 
 fresh buttermilk. Rye mush is considered very whole- 
 some, particularly in cases of dj^spepsia. 

French Icing for Cakes: — Dissolve some fine white 
 gum Arabic (finely powdered) in rose water. The pro- 
 portions should be, as much gum Arabic powder as will 
 lie on a ten-cent piece to a tea-spoonful of rose-water. 
 Beat some white of eggs to a stiff froth that will stand 
 alone. Stir in gradually, sufficient double refined pow- 
 dered loaf-sugar to make it very thick, (a good pro- 
 portion is four ounces of sugar to the white of one egg,) 
 add to this quantity a tea-spoonful of the rose-water 
 with the gum arabic dissolved in it, and beat the whole 
 very hard. Instead of rose-water you may dissolve the 
 gum in fresh lemon-juice. Previous to icing the cake, 
 dredge it with flour, and in a few minutes wipe it off 
 with a clean towel. This, by removing the greasiness 
 of the outside, will make the icing stick on the better. 
 Heap the icing first on the middle of the top of the cake; 
 then with a broad bladed^knife spread it evenly all over 
 the surface. Dip the knife frequently in a bowl of cold 
 water as you proceed, and smooth the icing well. If not 
 thick enough, wait till it dries, and then add a.second coat. 

Bread Muffins: — Take four slices of stale light bread, 
 and cut off all the crust Lay them in a pan, and pour 
 boiling water over them; but barely enough to soak them 
 well. Cover the bread, and after it has stood an hour, 
 drain off the water, and stir the soaked bread till it is a 
 smooth mass; then mix in two table-spoonfuls of sifted 
 flour, and a half pint of milk. Having beaten two eggs 
 very light, stir them, gradually, into the mixture. 
 Grease some muffin rings, set them on a hot griddle, and 
 pour into each a portion of the mixture. Bake them 
 brown ; send them to table hot ; pull them open with 
 your fingers, and spread on butter. They will be found 
 an excellent sort of muffin; very light and nice. 

Strawberry Cakes: — Sift a small quart of flour into 
 a pan, and cut up among it a half pound of the best fresh 
 butter: or mix in a pint of butter if it is soft enough to 
 measure in that manner. Rub with your hands the but- 
 ter into the flour, till the whole is crumbled fine. Beat 
 three eggs very light; and then mix them three table-
