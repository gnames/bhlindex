spoonfuls of powdered loaf-sugar. Wet the flour and 
 butter 'with the beaten egg and sugar, so as to form a 
 dough. If you find it too stiff, add a little cold water. 
 Knead the dough till it quits your hands, and leaves 
 them clean. Spread some flour on your paste board, 
 and roll out the dough into a rather thick sheet. Cut it 
 into round cakes with the edge of a tumbler or something 
 similar; dipping the cutter frequently into flour to pre- 
 vent its sticking. Butter some large square iron pans or 
 baking sheets. Lay the cakes in, not too close to each 
 other. Set them in a brisk oven and bake them light 
 brown. Have ready a sufficient quantity of ripe straw- 
 berries, mashed and made very sweet with powdered 
 white sugar. Reserve some of your finest strawberries 
 whole. When the cakes are cool split them, place them 
 on flat dishes, and cover the bottom piece of ea.ch with 
 mashed strawberry, put on thickly. Then lay on the top 
 pieces, pressing them down. Have ready some icing, and 
 spread it thickly over the top and down the sides of each 
 cake, so as to enclose both the upper and lower pieces. 
 Before the icing has quite dried, ornament the top of ev- 
 ery cake with the Whole strawberries, a large one in the 
 centre, and the smaller ones placed round in a close 
 circle. 

These are delicious and beautiful cakes if properly made. 
 The strawberries, not being cooked, will retain all their 
 natural flavour. Instead of strawberries you may use 
 raspberries. The large white or buff-colored raspberry 
 is the finest, if to be eaten uncooked. 

Washing Silver Wake: â€” A correspondent of the Ger- 
 mantown Telegraph says: 

Some thirty years since I was informed by a proprie- 
 tor of one of the largest and oldest silver establishments 
 in the city of Philadelphia, that "housekeepers ruined 
 their silver by washing it in soap suds ; it makes it look 
 like pewter; never put a particle of soap about your sil- 
 ver, then it will retain its original lustre; when it wants 
 polishing take a piece of soft leather and whiting, and rub 
 it hard." I had formerly seen silver washed in water 
 with the addition of a little soap and rinsed in clear 
 water. 

I adhered strictly to his advice, and found a great diff- 
 erence in the appearance of the silver. 

Leibig's New Work. 

A new treatise on the relations of Chemistry to Agri- 
 culture by Justus Leibig, has been issued from the 
 press, which will attract general attention. The subject 
 matter has especial reference to the celebrated experi- 
 ments of J. B. Lawes, of Rothamsted, which it is conten- 
 ded, overthrew the so called mineral theory of Leibig, 
 but which the latter says in the present edition, "he 
 considers as the firmest supporter of the theory which 
 they were originally intended to combat." 

He subjects these experiments to close examination, 
 and lays down some general propositions, elucidating his 
 own views of the true scientific principles of culture. 
 The price is only twenty-five cents, and it is put up in a 
 form for mailing. 

Labels of Fruit Trees. 
 After a trial of some years, we can confidently recom- 
 mend the following composition as making an indelible 

marking ink on zinc for trees. Let strips of zinc, half 
 an inch wide and perfectly bright, of any stiitable length 
 be procured, punch a hole in one end, and suspend by 
 copper wire to the branch of a tree, with the name writ- 
 ten on, and it will remain for many years indicating at 
 all times the name, and preventing much of the confu- 
 sion so prevalent in nomenclature of fruits. It should be 
 written with a quill pen, and always shaken before using. 
 Take one drachm Verdigris, one drachm Sal ammonia 
 powder and half a drachm of Lamp black, and mix with 
 ten draclims of water. 

PROTECTIVE BEE-HIVE, 

Among the many Bee Hives for which patents have 
 been obtained, the above deserves attention. The pa- 
 tentee thus describes it : 

1. This Hive furnishes, as its name indicates, protection 
 against the encroachments of the Bee-Moth. This is ef- 
 fected in a manner, and upon a principle entirely new. 
 No cage, trap, or decoy, is constructed for the Bee-Moth. 
 In a peculiar manner the animal heat naturally emanating 
 from the bees is intercepted, and in this way the deposits 
 and hatching of the eggs of the miller is prevented. As 
 to the real value of this arrangement or protection, no 
 comments are needed. 2. It is easily ventilated in sum- 
 mer and winter. 3. It provides for the deposit and re- 
 moval of surplus honey without a destruction of the bees. 
 4. The work and condition of the bees can be readily in- 
 spected. 5. It is a Hive of great durability. 6. It 
 prevents the bees from clustering upon the outside 
 of the hive. < 7. In it bees are fed without inviting 
 robbers from other hives. 8. It affords ample room to 
 prevent the bees from swarming, when required. 9. It 
 is easily cleared of dead bees and every offending sub- 
 stance. 10. This hive is made for exposure to the 
 weather, answering the purpose of hive and house, and 
 on this account is the cheapest hive which can be used, 
 ll. It dispenses with a Bee-House, which affords a shel- 
 ter for all kinds of insects. Its location is in the open
