Debates of the American Pomological Society. 

The proceedings of the third biennial meeting of the 
 American Pomological Society, held last fall in the city of 
 Boston, were duly published some months since in pamphlet 
 form, and contain much valuable information to the farmer 
 and fruit grower. The essays in two of our recent numbers 
 on the diseases and insects affecting fruit trees and vines, by 
 T. W. Harris, were extracted from its pages, and we now 
 give, from the discussions on fruit, the following relative to 
 varieties known in Pennsylvania, excepting the apple, chiefly 
 by reputation. The decisions elicited by these discussions 
 are reliable and useful, embodying as they do the long ex- 
 perience and experiments of the best Pomologists in the 
 country: 

The Lawrence Pear: — Mr. Walker of Massachusetts. 
 This pear, in my estimation, is one of the greatest acquisi- 
 tions to the list of pears. I know of no winter pear, taking 
 all in all, that is equal to the Lawrence. I think it will not 
 bo going too far, when I say that the time will come when 
 the Lawrence pear will be as eagerly sought after in the 
 markets as the old St. Michael was. There are other qual- 
 ifications, also, to be borne in mind. In the first place, the 
 tree is a thrifty one; it has an abundance of foliage, and 
 holds it until the frost comes. There is another property- 
 peculiar to the Lawrence. The fruit clings to the branches 
 as though it had been tied on, reminding one of the Urban- 
 iste in that particular. He desired that an expression may 
 go out from this society that the Lawrence pear is among 
 the very best; and, probably, the best of the late varieties 
 of pears. 

Mr. Prince of Long Island. I would remark that it is 
 one of the most vigorous trees; it is invaluable on that ac- 
 count; is always porfect, and is long keeping. I think it so 
 invaluable a fruit, that the time will arrive when it will hold 
 the same position for exportation, the Baldwin apple does. 

Mr. Manning of Massachusetts. Before the question is 
 put on the Lawrence pear, I wish to say thatl have known 
 it for some twelve years, and from my own experience con- 
 sider it the most valuable late pear that has been introduced 
 within that time. It is hardy; its flavor is excellent; and 
 I scarcely know of any point in which it is deficient. 

Mr. Hayes of New Jersey. It originated on a light sandy 
 loam; and I should like to know if it will grow on a heavy 
 clay soil. 

The President. It will; and I wish to confirm the favor- 
 able opinion that has been expressed concerning it. It is 
 one of the most valuable that has been cultivated. It is so 
 valuable that Mr. Cushing, of Waterton, has grafted over a 
 great number of trees with it, — so many that he found it 
 difficult to obtain scions to do the work with. 

The Lawrence pear was unanimously recommended for 
 general cultivation. 

It was hero voted, on motion of Mr. Hancock, that it 
 should require a vote of two-thirds of the members present, 
 to place any fruit on tho list for general cultivation ; and 
 where much difference of opinion existed, that the number 
 of votes for and against tho recommendation be registered 
 in the records of the society. 

Manning's Elizabeth was next discussed. H. W. S. 
 Cleveland of New Jersey. I desire to give my testimony in 
 favor of this pear. I have fruited it for six or seven years, 
 and have always found it of very fine flavor; always selling 
 very readily, and a very hardy, vigorous tree. I recommend 
 it, without hesitation, for general cultivation. 

Mr. Cabot of Massachusetts. I recommend it for general 
 cultivation. It is a very good pear, and good bearer, though 
 it is rather small. 

Mr. Hancock of New Jersey. I have had it about ten 

years, and have universally found it good. For the last two 
 years I have considered it the best pear of the season we 
 have in New Jersey. 

Mr. Maniee of New York. It is very fine, very produc- 
 tive, and very handsome. 

It was unanimously voted to place this pear on the list 
 for general cultivation. 

The Jefferis Apple: — Dr. Eshleman of Pennsylvania. 
 I would recommend that the Jefferis be put on the list for 
 trial. I have eaten it at our Society's Exhibition for three 
 successive years, and consider it tho best apple of its season 
 that I have ever seen. 

Mr. Baldwin of Pennsylvania. I have seen it for several 
 years. It has always been considered the finest apple of its 
 season, which we have had at our society. 

Mr. Hancock of New Jersey. It is the best seedling apple 
 I have seen for a number of years. I consider it No. 1. It 
 is ripe during the latter part of this month [September] and 
 the early part of October. 

Mr. Hooker of New York. That apple has been shown 
 at the exhibitions of Chester County for three or four years, 
 and has universally been pronounced best. 

It was unanimously voted to place it on the list of those 
 varieties which promise well. 

Blackberries : — Mr. Cabot of Massachusetts. I wish to 
 enquire about Lawton's New Rochelle Blackberry. I have 
 seen something of it, and it seems to me a very good one. 

Mr. Prince of New York. It is the most remarkable ac- 
 quisition of the blackberry kind ; very sweet and delicious 
 indeed, a great bearer, and the hardiest plant possible. They 
 are planting it extensively. 

Mr. Maniee of New York. It is very large, tender, and 
 delicious. I think it tho greatest acquisition we have had. 

Mr. Saul of Now York. I can corroborate what others 
 have said. Mr. Charles Downing made a special journey to 
 New Rochelle to see this blackberry, and found three acres 
 covered with it. He said it was the greatest sight he ever 
 beheld, and entirely exceeded his expectations. The bushes 
 were completely loaded with fruit, and he thought it a great 
 acquisition. 

Mr. Clark of Connecticut. I never saw any thing more 
 productive. Adopted as promising well. 

Mr. Prince of Long Island. I wish to ask whether gen- 
 tlemen know any thing of Needham's White Blackberry. 

Mr. Manning of Massachusetts. I have had it on my 
 grounds, and think it a very valuable variety, though not so 
 much so as the Black. 

Mr. Cabot of Massachusetts. I have seen it repeatedly 
 and supposed it an accidental seedling. I should hardly 
 think it worth notice. 

Mr. Prince of Long Island. It is found plentifully in 
 Vermont and Ohio. I have tried it, and found it very un- 
 productive. 

Mr. Cutter of Now Hampshire. With me it is perfectly 
 worthless. 

Mr. Walker of Massachusetts. This White Blackberry 
 is a very miserable affair, and I think the less we say of it 
 in our publication tho better. I move we close tho discus- 
 sion on this subject. The motion was adopted. 

Italian Eye-Grass, 
 The following is taken from the Genesee Farmer: — "We 
 consider the Italian Rye-Grass, or, as it is sometimes termed, 
 Jl a y — one of the most beautiful grasses yet introduced into 
 this country, and doubt not that it will also prove itself one 
 of the most valuable, either for green food or hay." The 
 Farmer correctly describes tho sort we are acquainted with, 
 and from our small experiments, we feel assured it will suo
