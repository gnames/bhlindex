ceed as well in this latitude as elsewhere in the Union. Sep- 
 tember, if seasonable, is probably the best time for sowing. 
 But in our case the seeds were planted early in spring, and 
 although the succeeding summer, as every one knows, was 
 very dry throughout, it grew finely and maintained its fresh- 
 ness and beautiful green appearance. Wo have also proof 
 that it will withstand our coldest weather, as our little 
 "patch" has grown vigorously through our past unusually 
 severe winter. For lawns and woodland pastures we know 
 nothing prettier — not even the far-famed Kentucky Blue- 
 Gnss. The Farmer says: 

"This grass, recently introduced into the United States, is 
 either a native of Italy or Germany, and is probably peren- 
 nial. It differs from the common kinds of Rye-Grass in 
 many botanical particulars, which it is neodless to enume- 
 rate, and which aro only intelligible to the scientific eye; 
 but to the ordinary observer, it differs very perceptibly in 
 presenting a darker green color, and having much more 
 abundant and broader foliage. It very commonly attains 
 the height of four feet and sometimes more, and is not in- 
 clined to spread on the ground. If sown in September, it 
 may be cut in the following May; and if sown early in 
 March, it will yield a heavy crop in July. Whether given 
 as green food or converted into hay, it is eaten with avidity 
 by cattle, which have, in various instances manifested their 
 preference for it to the common sorts, which is accounted 
 for by its superior succulence and softness. It braids much 
 quicker than other species of Rye-Grass known to us, ar- 
 rives sooner at maturity, and is in every respect superior to 
 all of them. As it overpowers clover when sown with it, it 
 is useless to sow them at the same time; and the only chance 
 of their doing well together would be on poor soil, where the 
 vacancies between the turfs of Rye-Grass might be filled 
 with clover, to be available in the second or third mowings. 
 It is sown in the usual way after a harrowing, and covered 
 with a brush-harrow and roller, and the quantity of seed for 
 clean ground is about twenty-one pounds per acre. Among 
 its other good qualities, it is found to withstand the influ- 
 ence of frost better than any other variety of grass. In a 
 word, it is a decided acquisition to our agriculture." 

Lasting Effect of Bones. 

Bones, in their natural and uncrushed state, show little 
 immediate effect, in consequence of their power of resisting, 
 but if mixed in large quantities, in a crude or semi-pulver- 
 ized stato, with the soil of a field, the benefit would undoubt. 
 edly bo extremely lasting. The effect would not be manifest 
 in the remarkable iucrease of any crop, but in the moderate 
 production of many crops through a series of years. Any 
 one who has ever taken pains to study the subject, cannot 
 have failed to observe the slow decomposition of uncrushed 
 bones, as from year to year they are turned up by the plow 
 from out the soil of the garden. They may not have been 
 placed there intentionally to answer the purpose of a ma- 
 nure, but have been thrown out from the kitchen into the 
 most convenient place for getting rid of them. The bones 
 in this position slowly decompose, yielding up their constit- 
 uent elements to new combinations, the earthy particles at 
 the same time crumbling into dust. 

A man should not labor solely for his own immediate ben- 
 efit, but he should look to the benefit of future years; and 
 hence, if there be no conveniencies at hand for converting 
 bones into super-phosphate of lime, or of crushing them to 
 dust, they ought by no means to be wasted. Their incorpo- 
 ration, in an uncrushed state, with the soil, will greatly add 
 to its lasting fertility. 

We know of a field in an adjoining county that had been 
 cropped for thirty years, and is now in a high state of fer- 

tility. The surrounding fields are nothing like it, and with 
 similar cultivation would by this time have been utterly im- 
 poverished. The former is the site of an old Indian burying 
 ground, and when the country was first settled, was inden- 
 ted with graves within six feet of each other, all over the 
 surface. The dead were buried in a sitting posture, not over 
 two feet below the surface, and the writer, when a boy, filled 
 his pockets many a time with beads and arrow-heads, turned 
 up by the desecrating plowshare. The half decayed bones 
 of the aborigines are this day to be seen mingled with the 
 soil, and, sad as it may seem, furnish food to successive 
 crops of grain and grass. If the soil at any time gave signs 
 of impoverishment, the occupant merely run the plowshare 
 a few inches deeper, and turned vp a few more Indians ! A 
 goodly number of the readers of the Rural will recognize 
 the place referred to, and can vouch for the truth of the 
 above statement. The melancholy truth cannot be gain- 
 sayed, that the ashes of a former race of men are to this day 
 enriching many of our fields, and the fact is thereby estab- 
 lished that animal remains, and especially bones, are of las- 
 ting benefit as an element of fertility. — Rural New Yorker.

Feeding Bees. 
 Tho theory of feeding bees on. a large scale has had its 
 day. It has presented splendid results for a time, and re- 
 sulted at length in splendid failures. Cheap honey, or a 
 composition has been used, and the Bees have been fed freely, 
 under the impression that whatever they stored in their cells 
 must of course be honey of the first quality. I would ask 
 why Cuba or Southern honey is not made of the first quality 
 when it is stored up for the first time in Cuba or Florida, if 
 Bees have the power ot converting an inferior article into 
 one of superior quality. Tho true reason is that much of 
 this so-called honey is taken from the sugar plantations, or 
 from flowers which do not furnish the best honey. And the 
 second transportation, although done by "Yankee" Bees, 
 does not produce any chemical change in tho articlo which 
 is fed. Honey is gathered, not made by the Bees. Those 
 who purchase in market Cuba honey which is packed up in 
 '•Yankee" boxes, do not get the best end of the bargain. 
 They have yet to learn that the packing or transportation 
 does not make it the fine flavored and wholesome articlo 
 which is found in white clover upon all our hills in New 
 England. The feeding of Bees on a largo scale, or with a 
 view to secure larger quantities of surplus honey, operates 
 unfavorably upon the Bees in a variety of ways, and the 
 principal objections to it are the following: 1. There is no 
 profit in it. No man gets the quantity of honey which he 
 feeds. 2. It prevents the Bees from going abroad to gather 
 honey from the fields. 3. If tho Bees are fed liberally late 
 in tho fall and early in the spring, there will bo very few 
 empty cells in which to rear young Bees. 4. It is deceptive, 
 because a cheap and inferior article is sold for one of supe- 
 rior quality. 5. It results, in the process of time, in the 
 extinction of the Bees. The feeding of Bees may be prac- 
 tised with advantage whenever they are not amply supplied 
 with winter stores, a thing which happens to late swarms 
 and to those from which large quantities of honey have been 
 taken. For this purpose a cheap article may be used to help 
 them through the winter. It may be desirable to take from 
 the Bees all the white clover honey which can be obtained in 
 boxes with a view to supply the Bees with a cheaper article.
