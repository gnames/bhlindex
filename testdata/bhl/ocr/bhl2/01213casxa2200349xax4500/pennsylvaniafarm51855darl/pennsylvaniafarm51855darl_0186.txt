[Junk 

made in its cultivation, promises to be one of great impor- 
 tance. According to the best foreign authority, it is "of all 
 the esculent roots proposed as a substitute for the diseased 
 potato, the only serious one. Largely grown in China, it is 
 very hardy, and stands the winter under the climate of Paris 
 perfectly well. It is easily propagated by cuttings of its long 
 vines, and by its roots, which are, like those of the potato, 
 of annual growth. The roots are large and long — the flesh 
 very mealy, and devoid of any peculiar or disagreeable 
 flavor." It has been pronounced by eminent cultivators in 
 Franco, "a precious acquisition." 

The result of the few that were grown in this country 
 during the last season, was very satisfactory. The N. Y. 
 Commercial Advertiser states that Mr. Bolles exhibited 
 some of the roots at a late meeting of the New York Horti- 
 cultural Society, and described them as giving a large yield, 
 capable of bearing a cold climate, and of remaining in the 
 ground during the winter. 

From the few specimens I have had the privilege of ex- 
 aming, the shape resembles the sweet potato, though less 
 uniform. The flavor is said to be somewhat similar to the 
 tame vegetable, but it is thought that wherein it differs, its 
 tendency will be to come into even more general use. 'Its 
 nutritious properties are said to exceed those of auy other 
 known root. 

Of its adaptedness to the climate of the Middle States, I 
 believe there can scarcely be a doubt; and there is every 
 reason for the belief, that even in Massachusetts, its cultiva- 
 tion will be attended with the most complete success. — Mass.

Beans with Indian Corn. 

It has long been an undecided question, whether beans 
 planted with Indian corn, are an actual injury to the crop. 
 Last year I had a piece of corn on the south side of a hill, 
 of rather gentle descent, and as it presented a favorable 
 opportunity, I determined to make the trial. There were 
 fifty rows of thirty-six hills each, in the piece* Commencing 
 on one side, I counted off eight rows, and planted the ninth, 
 tenth, eleventh and twelfth to corn and beans — dropping 
 the beans not with the corn, but about six inches on one 
 side. Eight more rows were then counted off, and the next 
 four planted in the same way ; the remainder of the entire 
 piece was planted to corn alone. 

At harvest, the first four rows, having the beans in them, 
 were cut and weighed, and then the four rows immediately 
 contiguous on either side, were cut and weighed. The same 
 course was pursued in reference to the other rows, and the 
 rows nearest them on either hand, and the result was no 
 perceptible difference existed in the amount of corn produ- 
 ced by the rows having beans in the hills, and that of the 
 rows having none. The soil throughout the piece was as 
 nearly of the same quality as it well could be, and the man- 
 agement of the entire piece was in every respect the same. 
 The beans made a very good crop, were well filled, plump 
 and fair, and the corn was also good. The manure used, 
 was short muck, one shovel full to the hill. The crop was 
 hoed three times, and a gill of plaster applied to the hill at 
 the second hoeing. — S. W. J. in Germantown Telegraph. 

Remedy for the Wire Worm. 
 Mr. D. Thompson, of Adams' Basin, in this county, in- 
 forms us that ho sowed a field to oats upon his farm soon 
 after it was purchased by him, and that the crop was entirely 
 cut off by the wire worm. He has since found by unmis- 
 takable experiments, that hog manure is an entire preventive 
 against their depredations. He has tested it repeatedly and 
 in a variety of ways, and always with success. One time he 

distributed the manure broadcast over a portion of a field of 
 corn, and plowed it in previous to planting, leaving another 
 portion unmanured. In that part where the manure was 
 distributed he had a good yield while on the other the rava- 
 ges of the worm was such as to destroy the crop. 

At another time he placed the manure in the hills of corn 
 in certain rows, leaving adjacent rows unmanured, and the 
 result was the former were untouched, while the latter were 
 entirely cut off. If this remedy is as efficacious as Mr. 
 Thompson assures us it is, the fact is invaluable for some 
 localities. At all events the application will be of great 
 advantage to the crop in other respects, if it fail in the one 
 claimed for it. 

A correspondent in Peterboro' writes lis that ashes mixed 
 with the barn-yard manure applied in the hill to corn, seems 
 to act as a specific with him, preserving the crop from their 
 ravages, while that, to which it was not so applied, suffered 
 severely. — Rural Neio Yorker. 

Farm Implements. 
 To use that old plow longer is bad economy ; repairs have 
 already come to more than the original cost, and still, it is 
 an old, ricketty plow. It always did "run to land" too much, 
 and always will, perplexing the plowman and fretting the 
 team. It has a radical defect past all cure of inventor or 
 mechanic. Do not work with heavy, uncouth implements — 
 they drag down the. body like a perpetual sorrow upon the 
 mind. Boys often acquire a disgust for farming, merely from 
 the use of the miserable implements placed in their hands. 
 The lighter the tool, the better, if strong enough for the 
 work for which it was intended. The workman who uses 
 his shovel to pry up a stone, and breaks it, should be re- 
 quired to pay for it, and the next timo, if not incorrigibly 
 lazy, he will probably use the bar. Use light rakes, made 
 of good material, and so of hoes, spades, scufBers, and all 
 other implements. We have beaten the English in the con- 
 struction of our agricultural implements, in their adaptation 
 to the work required of them. — N. E. Farmer. 

Beet Root Vinegar. 

In these times of a scarcity of apples and cider, the follow- 
 ing statement made by N. P. Fairbanks in the "Boston 
 Cultivator" is worth considering. He says : — The juice of 
 one bushel of sugar beets, worth twenty-five cents, and 
 which any farmer can raise with little cost, will make from 
 five to six gallons of vinegar, equal to the best made of 
 cider or wine. First, wash and grate the beets, and express 
 the juice in a cheese-press or in any other way which a little 
 ingenuity can suggest, and put the liquor into a barrel ; 
 cover the bung with gauze and set it in the sun, and in fifteen 
 or twenty days it will be fit for use. By this method the 
 very best of vinegar can be obtained without any great 
 trouble, and I hope all who like good vinegar will try it. 

As this may readily be tried by almost any one, we hope 
 to hear from some of our friends on the subject next winter. 

Another Cure for Garget. 
 Mr. Joseph Merriman, of Ohio, in an article communica- 
 ted by him to the Ohio Farmer on this subject, says the dis- 
 ease may be cured thus: — "Take raw linseed oil and rub all 
 over the cow's bag, which, if done on the first appearance, is 
 all that is needed generally, but two or three applications 
 always have cured the most stubborn cases, and is easily 
 done." He says he has seen cows that no milk could be got 
 from, cured in forty-eight hours, in summer, and they gave 
 nearly as much milk as they did before they were sick. This 
 is certainly easily tried, and no great harm can be done to 
 the cow if it should not prove successful. — Me. Farmer.
