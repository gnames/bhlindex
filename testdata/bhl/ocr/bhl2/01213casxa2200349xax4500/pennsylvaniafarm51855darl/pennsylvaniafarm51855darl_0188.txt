dicott and Stuyvesant Pears? From meteorological or other 
 causes, which we do not at present understand, particular 
 varieties may deteriorate in a given locality for a season, 
 and afterwards revive; or, they may show signs of decay 
 in one locality and flourish well in others not very remote — 
 as the White Doyenne, which has been considered for many 
 years, by some in this vicinity, on the decline, while it is 
 perfect in several places in Maine, New Hampshire, Ver- 
 mont, and other States. Fruit-bearing may exhaust the 
 vital energies of the tree and hasten decay, but still the 
 variety may remain. We have, among fruit trees, no exam- 
 ple of longevity equal to that of the new Taxodium, found 
 in California, supposed to be throe thousand years old. Our 
 object is not to controvert the opinions of those who believe 
 in the running out of varieties, whether their duration be 
 limited to one hundred or one thousand years; but to enforce 
 the importance of raising new varieties from seed, especially 
 adapted to our own location. 

Preservation and Ripening of Fruit: — Much progress 
 has been made in this art within a few years, and important 
 results have been attained. The principle has been settled 
 that the ripening process can be controlled. Autumnal fruits 
 have been kept and exhibited the succeeding spring. We 
 have seen the Seckel, Bartlett, and Louise Bonne de Jersey 
 pears, in perfection in January, and even later. The matu- 
 rity of fruits depends on saccharine fermentation. This is 
 followed by other fermentations, as the vinous and acetous. 
 To prevent these, and preserve fruit in all its beauty, fresh- 
 ness, and flavor, the temperature must bo uniform and kept 
 below the degree at which the fermentation or the ripening 
 process commences. Our remarks, like our experience, have 
 special regard to the apple and the pear, though the princi- 
 ple is doubtless susceptible of a more extensive application. 
 Fruits, designed to be kept for a considerable time, should 
 be gathered with great care some days before the ripening 
 process commences, especially summer pears. A summer 
 pear ripened on the tree is generally inferior. In respect to 
 the latter, Mr. Barry, Editor of the Horticulturist, has so 
 aptly expressed my own sentiments, that I use his language. 
 "The process of ripening on the tree, which is the natural 
 one, seems to act upon the fruit for the benefit of the seed, 
 as it tends to the formation of woody fibre and farina. When 
 the fruit is removed from the tree, at the very commence- 
 ment of ripening, and placed in a still atmosphere, the nat- 
 ural process seems to be counteracted, and sugar and juice 
 are elaborated instead of fibre and farina. Thus, pears w&ieh 
 become mealy and rot at the core when left on the tree to 
 ripen, become juicy, melting, and delicious, when ripened in 
 the house." Various fruit houses have been built both in 
 this country and in Europe ; and experience shows that 
 their object can be obtained only by a perfect control of the 
 temperature, moisture, and light. Hence, they must be cool, 
 with non-conducting walls, or with exterior and interior 
 walls, or a room within a room. Thus the- external atmos- 
 phere, which either starts the saccharine fermentation or 
 conveys the .agents which produce it, can be admitted or 
 excluded at pleasure. It is possible, however, to preserve 
 the temperature at so low a degree and for so long a time as 
 to destroy, especially with some varieties of the pear, the vi- 
 tality, and therefore all power ever to resume the ripening 
 process. Experience proves that for the common varieties of 
 the apple and pear, about forty degrees of Farenheit is the 
 temperature best suited to hold this process in equilibrium. 

The proper maturing of fruit thus preserved, demands 
 skill and science. Different varieties require different degrees 
 of moisture and heat, according to the firmnesss of the skin, 
 the texture of the flesh, and tho natural activity of the juices. 
 Thus, some varieties of the pear will ripen at a low temper- 

ature and in a comparatively dry atmosphere, while others, 
 as the Eastern Beurre, are improved by a warm and humid 
 air. 

Somo varieties of tho pear, ripening with difficulty, and 
 formerly esteemed only second rate, are now pronounced of 
 excellent quality, because the art of maturing them is better 
 understood. 

But so many experiments have been tried, or are in pro- 
 gress, and so much has been written on this branch of our 
 subject, that I need not enlarge except to say that tho art 
 of preserving and ripening fruit in perfection, involves so 
 much scientific knowledge as to require groat attention and" 
 care; and, until its laws are more fully developed, must ho 
 attended with considerable difficulty. I therefore commend 
 it to your special attention, as second in importance only to 
 the raising of new varieties. 

Truths Established by Agricultural Chemistry. 

FROM LIEBIG'R NEW W'ORK. 

The growth of a plant presupposes a germ, a seed ; the 
 land plant requires a soil; without the atmosphere, without 
 moisture, the plant does not grow. The words soil, atmos- 
 phere and moisture, are not of themselves conditions; theso 
 are lime, clay, sand-soils, soils originating from granite, 
 from gneiss, from mica-slate, from clay-slate, all entirely 
 different in their composition and qualities. The word soil 
 is a collective word for a large number of conditions. In a 
 fruitful soil, these conditions are combined in proportions 
 adapted to vegetable growth; in an unproductive soil, some 
 of them are wanting. In the same manner, the words ma- 
 nure and atmo^liere include a plurality of terms or condi- 
 tions. The chemist, with the means at his command, analy- 
 ses all kinds of soil; he analyses manures, the air and tho 
 water; he resolves the collective words which express the 
 sum of the conditions of vegetable growth into their single 
 factors, and, in his explanations, substitutes the individual 
 for the combined values. In this process, it is evident there 
 is nothing hypothetical. If it pass for a perfectly established 
 truth that the soil, the atmosphere, water and manures, ex- 
 ercise an influence upon the growth of the plant, it is no less 
 beyond doubt, that this influence is entirely due to the con- 
 stituents of the soil, &c; and the province of the chemist 
 is to set these ingredients before the eyes of those occupied 
 with vegetable cultivation, and to illustrate their qualities 
 and relations. 

1. Plants in general derive their carbon and nitrogen 
 from the atmosphere — carbon in the form of carbonic acid ; 
 nitrogen in the form of ammonia. From water (and ammo- 
 nia) they receive hydrogen. Their sulphur comes from sul- 
 phuric acid. 

2. Cultivated in soils, situations and climates, the most 
 various, plants contain a certain number of mineral substan- 
 ces, and in fact always the same substances, whose nature is 
 learned from the composition of the ash. Theso ingredients 
 of the ash, were ingredients of the soil. All fruitful soils 
 contain a certain quantity of them. They are absent from 
 no soil in which plants flourish. 

3. In the produce of a field is carried off and removed 
 from tho soil, tho entire quantity of those soil-ingredients, 
 which has become constituents of the plant. The soil is 
 richer at seed-time than at harvest. The composition of tfca 
 soil is changed after the harvest. 

4. After a series of years, and after a corresponding 
 number of harvests, the productiveness of a field diminishes. 
 When all other conditions remain unchanged, tho soil alone 
 becomes different from what it was previously; the change 
 in its composition is the probable cause of its becoming un- 
 productive.
