mixed with that of the pistil, which is a hollow tube, con- 
 nected with the gerniin, or young seed, the paricarp of which 
 being expanded and contracted by the variation of temper- 
 ature, this lymph of the pollen thus mixed with, is taken 
 into circulation in the rudiments of the young plant. If this 
 is correct, then it follows that the young plant, when the 
 pistil is thus impregnated with diseased pollen, must be 
 diseased also. — G. in Rural New Yorker. 

Pruning Currants and Gooseberries. 

We copy the above cut from the Gardener's Chronicle, 
 showing the true form of Currant and Gooseberry bushes 
 when properly trimed. — Ed. 

The pruning of Currant and Gooseberry bushes is seldom 
 performed in cottage gardens ; the consequence of which is, 
 that every bush in time becomes a mass of wood, producing 
 a quantity of worthless fruit, without either size or flavor. 
 This is to bo easily remedied by a little attention to pruning 
 the bushes in winter, and never allowing the branches to be 
 too crowded or to interfere with one another. The shoots 
 which spring up in the centre should be cut away very 
 closely, as well as the small shoots on the main branches, 
 leaving only one at their points, which must be shortened 
 for about a third of its length. If this is done, the bush will 
 have the form of a cup, with the branches ranged regularly 
 round the stem, as in the accompanying wood cut. Red and 
 white Currant require the same treatment, as they produce 
 their fruit on spurs in the way of the Gooseberry. The 
 black Currant must be managed differently, as it bears chiefly 
 on the shoots of the preceding year; instead, therefore, of 
 spurring and otherwise shortening the branches, all that is 
 necessary is to thin them, and keep the bushes compact.

Agriculture in France. 
 A letter writer for tho Republic says : — "A trip of six 
 hundred and fifty miles, from the northern to the southern 
 extremity of France, justifies me in the expression of my opin- 
 ion that the sun does not shed its rays on so fair a land, or 
 one so thoroughly cultivated. The whole country is literally 
 a garden. Every square foot, from the mountain-top to the 
 lowest ravine, is made to produce something, if it be sus- 
 ceptible of it. Their mode of planting or sowing their crops; 
 whether on plain or hill side, produces the finest effect on 
 the appearance of the landscape. The place allotted for 
 each crop is laid out in squares, or parallelograms, with 
 mathematical precision, and whether large or small, tho best 
 garden could not be divided with greater accuracy. As 
 thero are no fences or hedges, and as the different crops are 
 in various stages of maturity, you can imagine the variety 
 of hues that meet the eye, and the magnificence of tho pan- 
 orama that stretches out in every direction as far as the 
 vision can penetrate. In the absence of fences, cattle, se- 
 cured by ropes, are driven about their pasturage by females, 
 and sheep arc confined within the required limits by boys, 
 assisted by a shepherd's dog." 

Superphosphate of Lime.--Its Effects on Winter Grain, 
 and its Different Prices. 

Mr. Darlington: — I procured the article (made af- 
 ter Prof. Mapes's direction) last fall, applied it to Rye 
 at the rate of 400 lbs per acre, and harrowed it in with 
 the llye. It has a powerful effect on our Schuylkill 
 county soil. Some of my fellow farmers have used the 
 article manufactured and sold by Allen & Needles, and 
 speak very highly of it. 

The question now arises, why is Mapes's sold at $50 
 per ton, while that of Allen & Needles is at $40 ? 

The quantities of the different ingredients of which 
 the former is said to be composed, are published to the 
 world, consisting of lOOlbs. Bone Black, 56 lbs. Sulphur- 
 ic acid, 36 lbs. of Guano, and 20 lbs. Sulphate of Ammo- 
 nia. I have now some of the article manufactured by 
 Allen & Needles on hand intended for the oats crop. It 
 is certainly no more than proper that the farming com- 
 munity should know of what the article sold by the lat- 
 ter gentleman is composed of, and its proportions. A 
 difference of 25 per cent, is an item of importance to 
 the farmer. J. S. KELLER.

We beg to suggest to our friend Keller, to test the 
 comparative merits of the two articles by using them 
 side by side in alternate portions of a field. He will by 
 this means learn which composition is best suited to the 
 soil in his region. We should be happy to publish the 
 result. — Ed. 

DEARBORNS' SEEDLING. 

A very admirable, early pear, of first quality, raised 
 in 1818, by the Hon. II. A. S. Dearborn, of Boston. It 
 bears most abundant crops in every soil, and is one of the 
 most desirable early varieties, succeeding the Bloodgood, 
 and preceding the Bartlett. Young shoots long, dark 
 brown. Fruit scarcely of medium size, turbinate, and 
 very regularly formed. Skin very smooth, clear light 
 yellow, with minute dots, Stalk slender, rather more
