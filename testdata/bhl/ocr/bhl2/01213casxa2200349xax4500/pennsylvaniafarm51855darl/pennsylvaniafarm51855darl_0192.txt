garden for table use. In addition to its small size at 
 maturity, and its deep color, it is peculiar and may be 
 readily recognized by the abrupt termination of the ta- 
 pering point. 

The Red Altringham Carrot is used for field culture, 
 as 'well as the garden, resembles the above in color, but 
 seems to have a constitutional tendency to run into 
 sub varieties. It keeps 'well for winter use, and is of 
 fine flavor, but does not grow so large as the two follow- 
 ing. It is peculiar in having its crown two or three 
 inches above ground, and rather irregular taper. 

The Long Orange Carrot is the kind most usually culti- 
 vated and known in the United States, for a field crop. 
 It is of an orange color, sometimes inclining to red, and 
 grows often to the length of two feet, with a regular ta- 
 per from its crown to the point. Very little of it ap- 
 pears above ground. With proper cultivation six hun- 
 dred bushels of Long Orange Carrots have frequently 
 been and may be raised on an acre. 

White Belgian Carrots are larger than either of the 
 others, and have been grown at the rate of one thousand 
 bushels to the acre. They are much thicker than long, 
 somewhat in shape resembling the mangle wurzel, white 
 under ground, and green on the top, with the head con- 
 siderably above the surface. Although but of compara- 
 tively recent introduction, the White Belgian carrot is 
 now very extensively cultivated by the best farmers in 
 France and Belgium, and other parts of the continent, and 
 is thought by them to yield a larger bulk of produce than 
 any other, as well as an equal proportion of saccharine 
 matter. 

There are two other varieties of carrots cultivated in 
 England and France, under the name of Large Red and 
 Large Orange, but they are so little known here as to 
 make a description unnecessary No farmer, and espe- 
 cially no dairyman, should fail to plant a crop of carrots, 
 both for his cows and horses. 

The two Beets cultivated for a field crop known as the 
 Sugar Beet and Mangel Wurzel, seem to have originated 
 in Germany, the former being a variety of the latter. 
 The name anglicised means "root of scarcity " not a 
 scarce root, but a root for a time of scarcity, thriving 
 and growing abundantly when every other crop fails. 
 The Mangel Wurzel grows to an enormous size and pro- 
 duces most abundantly to the acre. Specimens have 
 been grown weighing over fifty pounds, and the average 
 produce to the acre, for a period of seven years, as re- 
 corded by some English writers, is from seven to sixteen 
 tons, the worst not falling below five, and the best not 
 exceeding sixteen tons. The Mangel Wurzel roots are 
 externally of a dull reddish color, internally somewhat 
 marbled, with reddish or reddish green leaves. The Su- 
 gar Beet or White Mangel Wurzel has green leaves, with 
 light green colored ribs, and is white both externally and 
 internally. They are very much the same in shape and 
 size, and equally hardy and productive. On analysis, 
 the Sugar Beet has been found to yield more nutritive 
 matter than the other, causing it to be generally pre- 
 ferred. 

The Mangel Wurzel differ so much from our garden 
 beets, in several characteristics, that Botanists have 
 been divided in opinion where to place them, some view- 
 ing them as a hybrid, others as a distinct species, under 

the name of Beta Altissima, and some as a mere variety 
 of the common beet. For all practical purposes, they 
 may be designated as field and garden beets. 

The Ruta Baga or Swedish Turnip is well known and 
 more generally cultivated for stock than perhaps any 
 other vegetable. It is superior to the common turnip for 
 this purpose, on account of its larger proportion of nu- 
 tritive matter, more solid texture, and retaining its juices 
 till quite late in the winter or spring. The true Swedish 
 Turnip is of a yellow color both in the interior and ex- 
 terior, the white variety having very much gone out of" 
 use, and being entirely unworthy of cultivation. 

Swedish turnips are also known as green topped and 
 purple topped. The former is the older variety, but 
 since the introduction of the latter has had less attention 
 bestowed upon it and less care in selecting the seed, 
 though equal in merit. Skirving's improved Ruta Baga 
 or purple topped Swede is now considered one of the best 
 varieties. Its leaves are more like the common turnip, 
 being less smooth and more serrated at the edges, than 
 other Swedish turnips, and it is claimed by him, that 
 they yield a greater weight per acre of sound nutritive 
 bulb, and are also hardier and longer keeping. 

The Ruta Baga may be planted later than either of the 
 other root crops we have mentioned, say the middle of 
 July, and can easily be made to succed a crop of early 
 potatoes. In this particular they have the advan- 
 tage. From six hundred to fourteen hundred bushels of 
 Ruta Bagas have been raised to the acre in the United 
 States. The rules for successful and profitable root cul- 
 ture are few and simple : heavy manuring, deep plow- 
 ing, thorough pulverization, clean culture, and avoid 
 all ridging.

 Improving Poor Land. â€” Field Pea. 

In this age of progress and improvement in agriculture, 
 any means calculated to improve and enrich poor land, 
 should attract the attention of farmers generally, and 
 when especially the means proposed are easily and can 
 be economically put into practice. 

I desire in this hastily written article to make simply a 
 few practical suggestions relative to the use of the corn 
 field pea, as an improver of poor land. I do so with a 
 desire that its use may become more general and diffused, 
 than it has been heretofore, as I am confident it will be 
 after our farmers become more acquainted with the fa- 
 cility and advantage of this culture as a fertilizer. 

The use of the field pea for this purpose ha3 been 
 practiced with the greatest success for several years past 
 in some portions of Virginia, where farms previously 
 very barren and sterile are now productive and in 
 some sections rich, owing to the culture of the pea, to- 
 gether with a better rotation of crops. 

I am fully aware however, that we are behind the ago 
 in the way of improvements in agriculture and the suc- 
 cessful culture of the soil, (by our more thrifty and en- 
 terprising neighbors of the northern States,) but I think 
 this discovery in husbandry we can boast of as south- 
 ern origin, and that too much praise cannot be awarded 
 to Mr. Ruffin, of Virginia, for I think he was the first to 
 recommend the use of the field pea as a fertilizer. 

The plan most usually adopted in planting the pea bx
