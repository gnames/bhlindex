the time for theirs to be held, but it is evident there will 
 be at least four exhibitions, not very far apart, in which 
 our citizens and farmers all feel a deep interest. Stir- 
 ring times may bo anticipated. We hope the ferry boats 
 will be found equal to the occasion, but we can but believe 
 it would have been much better for the United States 
 Society to have located theirs on this side of the river on 
 the excellent grounds at Powelton, and in co-operation 
 with the Philadelphia Society. 

The Coming Crops. 
 West of the mountains in our own State, in the wes- 
 tern States generally, and especially Michigan, the ac- 
 counts seem to agree in the promise of an extraordinary 
 wheat crop, the present season. In eastern Pennsylva- 
 nia, and in some of the best wheat counties in New York, 
 the very extreme cold, combined with the small quantity 
 of snow that fell last winter, killed it, we learn, to a 
 considerable extent. 

Mowing Machines and Lime Spreaders Again. 

Fkiend J. L. Darlington: — I notice in the April 
 No. of the Farm Journal, an attempt made by your cor- 
 respondent', Lewis Cooper, to undervalue my account 
 (given in the March No.,) of an experiment made by my 
 neighbor and myself with his Lime Spreader. He says, 
 I was a frequent visitor at the shop, making every in- 
 quiry, and was referred to my numerous neighbors who 
 had machines, and tried them successfully, &c; that 
 some men never can be suited, or don't know when they 
 are, and thinks this is the case with his neighbor; also, 
 thinks he never had any thing made to please him, even 
 to a wheelbarrow ; that he was cautioned not to sell him 
 a machine; that it would do him more harm than good; 
 that nobody could please him, and confesses he never 
 sold a machine with so much reluctance, believing he 
 had been properly cautioned ; that he can at any time 
 furnish certificates from at least fifty of my neighbors, 
 that will testify their satisfaction in the operations of 
 the same Lime Spreader, &c. 

Permit me in reply to state, that I never was in or 
 about his shops, except when I went to bespeak, and went 
 for my machine ; unfortunately, made inquiry only of 
 the proprietor ; never heard of the numerous neighbors 
 he says I was referred to, but was induced to engage a 
 machine by his, and newspaper puffs ; I had never seen 
 a machine operate, but since the publication of his April 
 communication, I have made considerable inquiry, and 
 unfortunately for his assertion, I can find but three of 
 my numerous neighbors within a circle of eight miles 
 who have machines, and one of them told me he could 
 do no good with Cooper's Spreader. Another, a near 
 neighbor of your correspondent, who had bought a half 
 right, (the Patentee holding the other half,) says the 
 machine is not what it ought to be ; that lie don't like it 
 as well as at first, when he saw it spread, and was in- 
 duced to sign a certificate ; that it will not spread lime 
 unless the lime is dry or mixed with dry lime. A third 
 neighbor who had a machine, (belonging to a son living 
 at some distance,) said he could do no good with it; 
 that he had spread many thousands of bushels of lime 
 with a shovel, but never worked so hard in his life as in 
 punching and trying to get the lime through this ma- 

chine, and that he would not give five dollars for one of 
 them. I cannot find one person, but says, Cooper's 
 Spreader, is not fit to spread Pequea lime, when hauled 
 and put down in heaps in the field to slack, the usual 
 way of treating lime in these parts. It may spread dry 
 lime, well pulverized and clear of lumps or sandy lime, 
 as in some parts of the country, if right well punched 
 about in the machine. 

"Nothing made to please him." Now I have a thresh- 
 ing machine, wheat drill, corn drill, guano sower, and 
 wheelbarroiv, all of which please me well, and the maker 
 or vender never heard a word of complaint from me. So 
 well known am I for favoring the introduction of meri- 
 torious machinery for agricultural purposes, that no less 
 than ten patentees and venders have, within the last 
 year, urged me to make the trial of their improvements. 

"Sold to him with great reluctance." After I bespoke 
 the machine, an acquaintance from a distance, who had 
 a share in a Spreader, told me they would do no good; 
 I shortly after met with Cooper, and told him, as the ma- 
 chine was not done by the time he promised, I thought 
 I would not take it, would wait another year, to which 
 he was not willing to agree, but insisted on my taking 
 it, which I did. 

People are often induced to sign certificates to satisfy 
 a neighbor, without seeing machines fairly tried, or 
 without thinking properly of the injury or loss others 
 may sustain by it. In these cases lime was generally 
 procured when dry and in nice order, and a number col- 
 lected to see the spreader operate, and then induced to 
 certify favorably for the machine, though they never saw 
 it tried with lime in the condition it is generally spread. 
 Those who get humbugged by such certificates are re- 
 strained from making public their disappointment, fear- 
 ing to expose themselves, or offend the venders or paten- 
 tees of such machines. I am, therefore, not certain, that 
 I will not yet be awarded a Silver Plow for breaking 
 through this restraint and cautioning the public. As 
 my Lime Spreader is as good as ever it was, if the pat- 
 entee will take it back I will allow him to keep twenty 
 dollars of the money I paid him. 

As to the mowing machines, they are procured on fair 
 terms, Lee, Pierce & Thompson offering to take back and 
 return the whole of the money, if they did not # answer 
 the purpose designed. I did not return mine, and I 
 think few, if any, were returned. They will mow and 
 do it well, when they get the knives and some of the small 
 fixings more permanently secured — I wish them success. 
 I gave an account of my first trial with the mower, 
 merely as a set off to friend Dampman's glowing ac- 
 count of his, and did not design to injure any vender or 
 patentee of either kind of machines, but merely to put 
 the farmer upon his guard. THOS. WOOD. 

Penningtonville, 4th mo. 18th, 1855. 

Our correspondents, Wood and Cooper, appear to en- 
 tertain entirely different ideas in regard to the Lime 
 Spreaders. Since this controversy has sprung upon us, 
 we have made many inquiries of persons owning Spread- 
 ers, nearly all of whom spoke favorably of them. Those 
 who did not succeed to their satisfaction stated that their 
 lime had laid in heaps over winter, and was wet and mor- 
 tary when the trial was made. We should be pleased to 
 hear from our friends at a distance, whom we have not been
