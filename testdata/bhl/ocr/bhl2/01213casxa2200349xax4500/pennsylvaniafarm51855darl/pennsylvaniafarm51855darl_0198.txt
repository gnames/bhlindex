CALF STICKLER. 

The above cut is a good representation of an imple- 
 ment for suckling calves, which was exhibited at the last 
 State Fair, and attracted much attention. It is simply 
 a tin vessel, holding a few quarts of milk, with a gutta 
 percha teat secured over the rim of the tube beneath. 
 This teat has within it a valve, through which the fluid 
 within is Irawn out by a slight pressure similar to that 
 of the calf's jaws, or of the hand in milking. 

It also has a handle by which to suspend to a hook in 
 the stable or yard, so that the calf may go to it at 
 pleasure. 

It seems to us that this simple calf suckjer may be 
 found highly useful and convenient, and save much of 
 the time and trouble required for feeding in the ordinary 
 way. The slower process also of drawing out the milk 
 in the natural way by suction, rather than to drink it by 
 mouthfuls, mixes it better with the saliva, and produces 
 more benefit. The cheap and economical raising of 
 calves has now become quite an object. At the prices 
 of stock cattle it will pay better to raise even here, than 
 to buy from the drovers. A home raised animal, partic- 
 ularly if crossed with an improved breed, alwaj's attains 
 a greater weight at the same age, than if purchased out 
 of a drove, and will always command from the butcher a 
 higher price. Never having gone off the farm, he is also 
 more docile and a better feeder. 

The calf suckler costs about two dollars and fifty cents. 

Lime Spreaders. 
 Ma. Darlington: — I see by the March number of 
 your valuable Journal, that a correspondent, near Pen- 

ningtonville, Chester county, Pa., has some grieveous 
 complaints to make in regard to certain Lime Spreaders 
 and Mowing Machines, which he says have been puffed 
 and blown about as superior labor-saving machines, and 
 awarded' premiums by committees, who never saw them 
 perform. As to mowing machines, I know but little, 
 but if he has reference to my Lime Spreader, in this re- 
 spect, I will with pleasure inform him, that the assertion 
 is without the least shadow of foundation, which I am 
 ready to prove by the committees, who awarded me pre- 
 miums ; as it is well known by the committees and mem- 
 bers of the Pennsvlvania, Maryland and Virginia State 
 Agricultural Societies, who awarded me premiums to the 
 amount of one hundred and twenty dollars last fall, that 
 I was not only at the expense of buying lime, but went 
 to the trouble of making it into nearly every condition, 
 in order to prove to them that my Lime Spreader did 
 all I claimed for it; but your correspondent, after making 
 a statement of the non-performance of a machine, which 
 he had purchased, says, "one of another patent, celebra- 
 ted for spreading wet lime, was procured, and also sent, 
 home." If this is true, it is the first instance I have ever 
 heard of ; yet it may be true. 

If the machine will not spread all kinds of lime a3 
 recommended, why is it that Messrs. Chalfant, Smith, 
 Strickland, Philips, and a host of others, who are your 
 correspondent's near neighbors, have not discovered the 
 humbug? These gentlemen have spread upwards of ten 
 thousand bushels, since April, 1854, and speak of its 
 superior qualities in glowing language. I have spread 
 lime with one of the machines — lime that had laid in 
 heaps for three years, and was spread in March, 1854, 
 which is known to have been a wet month. My machines 
 are warranted to operate as recommended, or no sale, and 
 as long as we do this, I should think that no man has a 
 right to cry humbug, because they happen from some 
 other cause to fail in their use. I will add, that if your 
 correspondent will name the day when he will have lime 
 to spread, I will come and spread it for him, if he will 
 publish through the Farm Journal a true and impartial 

account of its operation. JOSEPH W. FAWKES.

Trees. 

Mr. Editor: — There has been for many years an in- 
 creasing attention paid to the propagation of fruit trees, 
 but it is to be regretted that the labor is often lost by a 
 common error: that is — allowing the grass to grow too 
 near the trees. No young tree will grow well when a 
 sward is formed around it. Yet in travelling our country 
 in every direction we see this mistake. 

The earth should be turned over in the spring, and in 
 the latter part of the summer or beginning of autumn, at 
 least three feet from the trees ; then all weeds, or grass 
 which spring up, will rot and become excellent manure 
 for them. Thus they will grow rapidly, otherwise they 
 often die before coming to maturity. 

The importance of raising forest trees is also becoming 
 every year more apparent, as there is an increasing scar- 
 city of wood in all cities or towns. To propagate these 
 also the same treatment should be resorted to as with fruit 
 trees. In planting, the hole dug for them should in all 
 cases, be much larger than the space necessary for the 
 accommodation of the roots, and it should be filled with
