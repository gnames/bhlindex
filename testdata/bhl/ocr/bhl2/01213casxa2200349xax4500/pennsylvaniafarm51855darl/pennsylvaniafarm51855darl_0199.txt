the best earth intermixed with manure. Although an 
 observance of this method will require more labor, it will 
 be great gain, as the trees will be larger in seven years, 
 than they would become in twenty if cultivated in the 
 common way. ARBORD. 

Farm Fencing. 
 . Our friend Col. Mayer, of Lancaster, in a private let- 
 ter to the editor, makes the following incidental allusion 
 to the subject of fencing. We trust he will find leisure 
 at an early clay to favor us with his views more at large 
 on this important topic. His long experience, and hab- 
 its of close observation in all matters to which he directs 
 his attention, give great weight to his opinions. 

"Having some thirty years experience in farm fencing, 
 which time I have re-fenced the lands of my large West 
 Earl Farm, I will at my leisure furnish you an article on 

that subject generally. Suffice it for the present to say 
 that green locust posts will last years longer than dry. 
 That posts of full grown sound timber free from decay, 
 prove to last longer in their natural than inverted posi- 
 tion. The reverse is the result of posts made out of old 
 trees in progress of decay, which is at all times indicated 
 by the dead tops, branches, decay or porosity of the butt 
 cutt."

A Splendid Stick. 
 A stick of white oak timber, measuring fifty-one feet 
 eleven inches in length, and squaring forty-one by forty 
 inches, making nearly six hundred cubic feet, has been 
 "manufactured" at Wallacebarg, C. W. This is said to 
 be the largest stick of timber ever cut on the North Amer- 
 ican Continent.

We have received the premium list for the June ex- 
 hibition of this Society to be held on the 12th, 13th, 
 14th and 15th insts. The Society "invites the co-opera- 
 tion and competition of cultivators. The purses are 
 open to all, and the Society institutes for the benefit of 
 all. 

Cultivators who neglect these exhibitions, act on a very 
 suicidal policy, while every one having a taste for the 
 cultivation of fruits, flowers, &c, and wishing it extend- 
 ed, should lend a helping hand. 

It embraces several new objects of competition, which 
 want of space prevents us from referring to more par- 
 ticularly in this number.

Premiums at Exhibtions. 
 Mr. Editor: â€” Your correspondent T. W. in a late 
 number of -the Farm Journal, makes the pertinent 
 enquiry: "Why do committees award premiums to ma- 
 chines and implements, which are good for nothing?" 
 T. W. does not say to what committee he refers, but it is 
 shrewdly suspected he had his eye on the late exhibition 
 at Powelton. As a quiet observer on tnat occasion, more 
 especially of the department of implements, to which my 
 mechanical taste and inclination led me, I passed from 
 machine to machine, comparing tne merits of each, con- 
 trasting the simplicity of one with tne cumbrcis char-
