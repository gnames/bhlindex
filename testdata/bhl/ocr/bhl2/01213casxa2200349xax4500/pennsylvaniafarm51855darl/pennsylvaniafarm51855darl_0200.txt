acter of another, where two or more were designed for 
 the same purpose, thus forming my own judgement, or 
 where preconceived opinions existed, correcting, changing 
 or confirming them, either by closer scrutiny or inter- 
 change of ideas with others of similar tastes with my 
 own, whom I met with on the grounds. Thus I became 
 pretty intimately acquainted with nearly all the inple- 
 ments of value, formed my own conclusions as to their 
 respective and comparative merits, and awaited the pub- 
 lished awards, with some little curiosity. I need not say 
 Mi*. Editor, the conceit was taken out of me. Machines to 
 which I would hardly have given shelter, were dignified 
 by "Silver Medals" and others of third or fourth rate 
 value, were assigned "first premiums." 

That the committees intended to do rightly, no man 
 can doubt, — to have "approached" them in the sense un- 
 derstood by the trading politicians of our Legislature, no 
 one would have ventured — but insidious snares some- 
 time succeed, when the open bribe would utterly fail, 
 base metal, in other words impudent assurance may be 
 more potent than modest merit. 

Mr. Editor, if the evil ended with the award, there 
 would be less cause of complaint, but unfortunately 
 many men distrusting their own judgement, are guided 
 by that of committees, make their purchases according- 
 ly and when too late to protect their pockets, find they 
 have been egregiously deceived, that the implement which 
 has reached them, endorsed by a respectable committee is 
 utterly worthless in comparison with others designed for 
 the same purpose, which are passed by without a word of 
 commendation. Another phase of the evil, arising from 
 the honest indignation of makers or inventors, who con- 
 scious of the value of what they exhibit, and to which 
 they invite the strictest scrutiny, find themselves over- 
 shadowed or forstalled by the effrontery of some one, 
 who worms himself into the confidence of the committee, 
 who perhaps yield unwillingly to avoid his unblushing 
 importunity. 

The committee on implements at the late State Fair, 
 were originally composed of gentlemen, selected on ac- 
 count of their presumed capacity for the duties asssigned 
 them, but in many instances they failed to appear and 
 their places were hastily filled by men "honest and true" 
 but wholly incompetent. 

It is to be hoped, hereafter that the executive com- 
 mittee will so sub-divide the committees, that not more 
 than an hour or two need be consumed by each, then 
 competent gentlemen will not hesitate to act and we shall 
 be spared the boasting advertisements which have suc- 
 ceeded the last show X. P. Q.

Lunar Influences on Agriculture. 
 In the Farm Journal of May, I noticed an interesting 
 article on the influences of the moon, respecting which 
 subject I should like to present some further inquiries. 
 I have not been able to see the number for August, 1852, 
 referred to by Mr. Garber and Mr. Hamilton, in their 
 articles, but I conclude that the proper time for cutting 
 briars, &c, there specified, is the sign of the Heart, 
 (Leo, the Lion,) in August. Several years ago, (in 1853,) 
 I made an experiment to ascertain the truth of this be- 

lief which I had often heard expressed, though the sign 
 recommended was different from the above, it being that 
 of the Arms, (Gemini, the Twins.) This trial proved un- 
 satisfactory, the bushes sprouting with equal vigor the 
 succeeding spring. Nevertheless, I have not relinquished 
 credence in these "superstitions," which, observed as 
 they are and have been through all ages aud in all na- 
 tions, are not to be risked on one or two experiments, 
 but on a carefully observed series. 

But this is not the only or the most interesting point 
 where the moon is said to touch Agriculture. In the 
 sowing and reaping of grain, the planting of garden veg- 
 etables, the cutting of timber, and in the transplanting 
 and setting out of fruit trees, many farmers still care- 
 fully attend some particular phase of the moon. On 
 these subjects, most of which are probably known to 
 many of your readers, I, for one, and certainly all eager 
 for true knowledge, would be heartily glad to be enlight- 
 ened by those who have experimented. 

A few months ago, when speaking to a highly intelli- 
 gent farmer of New York, he told me that in peeling 
 oak-bark for the tanneries, he had remarked that while 
 at some periods of the spring and summer this was very 
 easy, at others, dependant, the workman thought, on the 
 Moon, it was just the contrary. I suggested that per- 
 haps it was the new cortical layer forming in the spring, 
 which made it easy then, but he said the times in which 
 it was so, recurred periodically during the season. 

About thirty years ago there was an interesting article 
 published in the Annals of Philosophy* on these influ- 
 ences, principally embodying the observations of a gen- 
 tleman who had resided many years in South America. 
 Here it is stated that trees are least durable when cut 
 at full moon ; the difference in timber cut at this and at 
 the opposite syzygy being very apparent. The former 
 is more liable to be infested with worms, rots sooner, 
 and splits at certain periods after its fall. He also states 
 that, (in the tropics,) the sap rises at full moon, and 
 falls in proportion to the moon's decrease. 

It is well known to farmers that there are certain 
 nights, sometimes called "growing nights" on account of 
 the rapid growth of the cereals in them. We are told by 
 the traveller Dupons (Travels in Terra Firma Vol. II, 
 Ch. VII, pp. 150 and 158,) that in the cultivation of the 
 cacao great attention is paid to the lunar phases, the 
 cultivators having learned their importance by careful 
 experiment. 

It is earnestly to be hoped that that the interest exci- 
 ted in this subject will not be permitted to die cut, till 
 we know much more about the truth than we do now. 
 Will not some of those men who have observed the 
 "signs" practically, tell what they are and what are 
 their effects ? 

The high importance of the lunar influences has been 
 fully recognised in meteorology, medicine and geology, 
 so it is trusting in no mere chimera or empty superstition 
 to we bejieve their power over the vegetable economy.
