eold weather, for twelve hours ; in warm weather two hours

If baked in a brick oven, a three-quart loaf should stand 
 in the oven all night. The same quantity in three baking- 
 pans will bake in about three hours. 

Serve this warm from the oven, with good, sweet butter, 
 and we could fast upon it every morning for breakfast, 
 from January to December. — Plow, Loom and Anvil. 

Plum Trees. 

A correspondent of the Country Gentleman says: — "I 
 attribute my success mainly to an hereditary strain of Yan- 
 kee principle, producing a strong propensity to use a jack- 
 knife. My trees are mostly grafted on to suckers of the 
 native or wild plum, near or at the surface of the ground. 
 The scions take well in such stocks, and grow strong, fre- 
 quently from four to seven feet in a season. In the spring 
 of the first year, I cut back to two or two and a half feet, 
 and each spring following, from i to § of the last year's 
 growth. This causes them to grow stocky, with low, bushy 
 heads, and to set thickly with fruit spurs. I have trees in 
 different varieties of soil; some in cultivated, some in grass 
 land. All do well. I manure with what is most convenient, 
 without regard to kind or quality, long or short, stable or 
 hog manure, ashes, old lime, soap-suds, fish-brine, chip-ma- 
 nure, or whatever is at hand, plowed in or for top dressing. 

The great enemy of the plum-tree is the black-knot. Now 
 comes the grand question — Black-knot, what is it? Is it a 
 disease, or the work of an insect ? I will endeavor to an- 
 swer these questions according to my observations. I con- 
 sider it to be the work of an insect, with which I have no 
 personal acquaintance except in the maggot state. 

From frequent observation combined with practice, I find 
 that June is the time to look for the enemy. There are no 
 black knots then, of this year's growth, but simply swellings 
 npon the branches. Now use your jack-knife, and you are 
 sure of your foe. When these swellings first commence, so 
 as easily to be found, the insect is of the exact color of tho 
 excrescence, and so small as usually to escape detection. 
 Nevertheless he is there. From the middle of Juue to the 
 first of July, they are easily found, generally two in a knot, 
 varying from 1-20 to 3-8 of an inch in length — the largest 
 in tho mean time are leaving their cells. I have found them 
 near by, sheltered by the rough bark, covering themselves 
 with a thin, silk-like web. To all who wish to raise plums, 
 (and who does not?) I would say, here lies the secret. Cut 
 green knots instead of black ones. By following this prac- 
 tice, I have succeeded in raising very fine trees — not a black 
 knot is ever seen on them. A swelling is occasionally found, 
 but it is taken in time to secure the maggot. By this means, 
 the insects are reduced to that degree that my trees never 
 suffer thereby. I have trees from four to six years from the 
 graft, from eight to ten feet high, with large, spreading 
 teads, bearing the first season from one to more than two 
 bushels per tree, of most splendid fruit, as many a satiated 
 appetite can testify." 

The Importance of Farm Registers and Farm Accounts. 
 Perhaps there is nothing of so much importance, that is 
 so much neglected by the farmer, as the practice of keeping 
 a diary, or farm register, and a strict account of all his re- 
 ceipts and expenditures. How many farmers are there with- 
 in tho circle of your acquaintance, who can tell how much 
 money they have received during the year, and for what; 
 whether tho profits, if any, have been derived from their 
 corn, hay, or wheat, from their horses, cattle, or hogs, and 
 upon which they have sustained a loss; whether their crops 
 have been worked in due season, and with a judicioui econ- 

omy in every particular; how much corn, or its equivalent, 
 it will take to produce a pound of beef or pork, and what 
 method of feeding will give the groatost return. I fear that, 
 upon examination, tho number found who could answer these 
 questions correctly would be few indeed. And why is it so? 
 One reason is, the careless and shiftless manner in which 
 farmers generally manage every thing connected with farm 
 work. What would you say of the merchant who followed 
 his business in such a manner, some branches of his busi- 
 ness being attended with a certain loss, asd unknown to 
 him, solely because he neglected to keep a strict account 
 upon each branch ? You would say, that he would be obligei 
 to sell out, sooner or later, to save the sheriff the trouble. 
 But the merchant, even in our small county towns, deems it 
 indispensable to success in business to keep an accurate ac- 
 «ount of every transaction. Then let the farmer adopt such 
 a course. Let him keep an accurate account of his receipts 
 and expenditures, profit and loss, upon each item, and every 
 branch of his business, or with every field. Let him carry 
 a small book in his pocket, and daily note down the various 
 items of work for eaoh day, together with such practical 
 suggestions as may occur to his mind; and, my word for it, 
 he will find himself much the gainer in a pecuniary point of 
 view, while he secures, also, much gratification and pleasure 
 in a review of his labor from year to year. The farmer 
 would then know at a glance from what crops, what class of 
 animals, and what course of management, he receives tho 
 greatest profits, and on what ho sustains loss. Would not 
 this be a knowledge of the greatest benefit in determining 
 his course for the future? Let this practice become general, 
 and the benefits arising from it would soon be made mani- 
 fest in the improved condition of the farming community. 
 They would be seen in the greater interest which would be 
 awakened in those who now follow in the same old, beaten 
 paths which their fathers trod, and who keep no accounts 
 except such as they record with chalk. We should then seo 
 a desire on the part of farmers to possess a "little farm, well 
 tilled," rather than to add acre upon acre to their already 
 largo estate, which has been rendered unproductive by shal- 
 low plowing, scanty manuring, and a hurried cultivation. 
 We should then see agriculture taking that stand which its 
 merits demand. J. W. A.

Durham Cattle. 
 To the Editor of the Makk-Lane Express; — The 
 Short Horn or Durham cattle are not only spreading over 
 every county in England, but Ireland; and the Long Horns 
 will soon become extinct both in England and Ireland, 
 There are many first-rate Durhams to be found in Scotland, 
 and many fine Short Horns have crossed the Atlantic Ocean, 
 and will soon spread all over the globe. They are a large 
 sizo at early maturity. In England, the cows and heifers 
 are worth more than any other kind for the milkman in the 
 metropolis and other great towns. It is rare that you see a 
 Hereford, Devon, or Long Hornod cow among the milkmen 
 in London. Tho best Durham oxen have thick, wide, fat 
 backs, with a handsome frame, and plenty of lean flesh, with 
 heavy thighs, and generally when made fat, weigh all the 
 weights they are laid at; they are no longer than the gener- 
 ality of Herefords and Devons, and a great many Short 
 Horns are as large and as heavy at three years old as the 
 Devons and Herefords are at four. They carry plenty of 
 tallow according to age, and the best of them have a fine 
 silky grain, with marbled flesh. I find no beast come to the 
 scale better, with the exception of the thickest, lean-fleshed, 
 short-legged, polled Scots; and I have purchased manyhalf- 
 breds between tho best polled Soots and the Durhams fed in
