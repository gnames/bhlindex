A Psalm of Life. 

BY H. LONGFELLOW. 

Tell me not in mournful numbers, 

Life is but an empty dream ; 
 For the soul is dead that slumbers, 

And things are not what they seem. 

Life is real, Life is earnest 

And the Grave is not its goal; 

Dust thou art, to dust returnest, 
 Was not spoken of the soul. 

Not enjoyment and not sorrow 

Is our destined end or way, 
 But to act, that each to-morrow 

Finds us farther than to-day. 

Art is long and Time is fleeting, 

And our hearts though stout and bravo, 

Still, like muffled dreams, are beating 
 Funeral marches to the grave. 

In the world's broad field of battle, 

In the Bivouac of Life, 
 Be not like dumb, driven cattlo, 

Be a Hero in the strife. 

Trust no future, however pleasant, 
 Let the Dead Past bury its dead; 

Act, act in the living Present, 
 Heart within, and God o'erhead. 

Lives of great men all remind us 
 We can make our lives sublime, 

And, departing, leave behind us 
 Footprints on the sands of time. 

Footprints, that perhaps another, 
 Sailing o'er life's solemn main, 

A forlorn and shipwrecked brother, 
 Seeing, shall take heart again. 

Let us then be up and doing, 

With a heart for any fate ; 
 Still achieving, still pursuing, 

Learn to labor and to wait. 

Camphor vs. Pea-Bugs. 
 A correspondent of tho Plow, Loom and Anvil says: — 
 "Having observed in the Horticulturist an inquiry relative 
 to seed peas damaged by bugs, I will offer a remedy perhaps 
 not new but new to me. Four years ago last spring, my seed 
 peas were more than half destroyed by bugs, the largest and 
 best varieties being most injured. The summer following, 
 I had boxes made, one for each variety, with a cover ; and 
 when the peas were gathered, I put into each bos, with two 
 quarts of peas, from six to eight bits of gum-crfmphor the 
 size of a large pea, and mixed them together and closed the 
 box. The next spring there was not a pea injured. I have 
 pursued the same course every year since, and have not had 
 one pea affected by bugs. 

Draining. 
 John Johnston, of Seneca county, N. T., gives in the 
 American Agriculturist the following plan to ascertain, 
 whether land needs draining: — "Dig holes about two and a 
 half feet deep in different parts of the field ; put a cover 
 over the holes so that the rainwater cannot get into them, 
 and if they fill with water until within a foot or so of tho 
 surface, in ten or twelve hours, then his land requires, and 
 will pay well for draining. I think I hear F. I. B., and many 
 others say, that these holes will fill up on any land, if the 
 ground is wet at the time. But I tell them it is not the case. 
 You may dig as many drains as you please on dry lands, 
 and they will never run water unless the snow is melting on 
 the surface. If F. I. B., had stood over the making of be- 
 tween forty and fifty miles of drains, as I have done, he 
 would be a better judge of what was wet and what was dry 
 land. To the unpractised eye, land that looks dry, is gorged 
 with water six inches below the surface." 

Culture of Asparagus. 
 Asparagus is a plant that will bear an exceedingly rich 
 soil, provided the manure is finely and thoroughly incorpo- 
 rated with the soil, and that plenty of room is needed for 
 each individual plant, its large growth depending on this as 
 an indispensable requisite. From our own observations we 
 are inclined to think that for its market production, it should 
 be in drills sufficiently remote to admit a narrow horse cul- 
 tivator. A very common cause for small shoots, even in beds 
 which have been dug and enriched two feet deep, is planting 
 too thick or near together, and afterwards allowing the evil 
 to be increased by the self-sowing process, numerous young 
 plants springing up all over the bed. We would give three 
 leading requisites of success namely — good soil, good culti- 
 vation, and plenty of room. — Exchange. 

Origin of Potato Oats. 
 We have to record the death of Mr. Daniel Jackson, of 
 Greenhill, Arkleby, Cumberland, at the advanced age of 94. 
 He was a considerable landed proprietor in the county, and 
 upwards of half a century since, purchased some potatoes 
 which were supposed to have come from abroad. When they 
 came up, among them a few heads of corn appeared, resem- 
 bling the oats, then generally grown in this country, but 
 larger and differing in appearance from the common sorts. 
 The seed was carefully preserved, and in a few years suffi- 
 cient was produced to offer it for sale. From the circum- 
 stance of its having been found originally among these 
 potatoes, it was called potato-oats. — Mark Lane Ex. 

Seeing the Elephant. 
 Passengers who travel by the New York and New Haven 
 cars have a grand chance of "seeing the elephant." Going 
 from New York, the cars pass the farm of P. T. Barnum, a 
 mile or so before reaching Bridgeport, Ct. On that farm, 
 and in plain view from the railroad, an elephant may be 
 seen every pleasant day attached to a large plow, and doing 
 up the "subsoiling" in first rate style, at the rate of about 
 three distinct double-horse teams. The animal is perfectly 
 tractable. His attendant rides him, while a colored man 
 guides the plow. The elephant is also used for carting large 
 loads of gravel in a cart arranged purposely for him, and in 
 drawing stone on a stone-boat or drag, in piling up wood, 
 timber, &c, and in making himself generally useful.- Tribune. 

Seedling Pie Plant. 
 A word in time. Do not purchase Victoria, or any other 
 Pie Plant seeds, under an impression that you will get the 
 true variety, when grown from seed; for if you do, you will 
 certainly reap disappointment. Pie Plant seed is equally 
 as liable to "sport" as apple seed; and you may just as 
 reasonably expect to grow a Rhode Island Greening apple 
 by sowing the seed, as expect to grow Victoria Pie Plant by 
 sowing its seed. About five in one hundred will be likely 
 to resemble the parent; but a seedling, exactly like the 
 original has never yet been grown, out of thousands of 
 seedlings grown yearly. The Pie Plant can only be in- 
 creased by divisions of the roots. — Ohio Farmer. 

Pork. 
 Mr. John Bacon, of Rockton, brought to market a lot of 
 hogs consisting of fifteen of which the following are the 
 weights. They were one year and a half old, of the "Corn 
 Crib breed," and all of one lot fed and fatted together. When 
 pigs, they were fed the slop of the kitchen till a year old or 
 so, and then fed corn till their demise :
