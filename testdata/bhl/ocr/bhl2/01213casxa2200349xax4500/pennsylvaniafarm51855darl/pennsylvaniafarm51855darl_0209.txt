tlemaii of this city, as to the comparative agricultural 
 resources of Pennsylvania and New -Jersey. Jt was con- 
 cluded to refer the matter to a committee of which Will- 
 iam Parry was one, for examination, and we cheerfully 
 give place to the article in the Farm Journal. A large 
 number of our subscribers reside in New Jersey, and it 
 is hardly less interesting to us in Pennsylvania than to 
 them, to know that her size being considered, she is al- 
 ready in advance of her sister states in some important 
 staples. In another part of our paper we copy some ad- 
 ditional statistics from the last census, appended to the 
 pamphlet premium list of the New Jersey State Society 
 for present year. 

We have been surprised to find the value of farm land 
 per acre in New Jersey, rated in the census above both 
 Pennsylvania and New York. 

Rye Grass. 

J. L. Darlington Esq. : — In the May number of the 
 Farm Journal you ask for further information from me 
 on the subject of Rye-grass. Should you think the fol- 
 lowing observations worth inserting they are at your 
 service. 

When a resident in England, I several times saw Ital- 
 ian Rye-grass growing, and once from necessity grew it 
 myself, but can say little if any thing in its favor. It is 
 of a very coarse quality and in my opinion only usable in 
 its green state when not more than three quarters grown. 

I believe the late Duke of Portland tried it, as well as 
 all the other varieties under the irrigation system, but 
 gave it up, and continued the best kinds of English. 
 Allow me at this point to call the attention of those gen- 
 tlemen who take an interest in agricultural pursuits, to 
 the system of irrigation, and should they at any time go 
 to England and wish to see it carried out in a perfect 
 and successful manner, to make a special visit to the 
 meadows of the Duke of Portland, at Clipstone, near 
 Mansfield, Notinghamshire. I mention these meadows 
 because I have no doubt many have sites in this country 
 as well adapted for irrigation as these are. 

I will now go back to the chief subject of this article. 

I have not the least hesitation in saying that the Ital- 
 ian Rye grass is nearly if not quite as great an exhauster 
 of soil as Timothy, besides which, it leaves a root which 
 it is scarcely possible to get clear of again. I have also 
 but little if any doubts that it is the wild variety from 
 which all those named as English have been propagated. 
 One who is fully conversant with botany, could, I pre- 
 sume decide that point, and also whether the Ray-grass 
 spoken of in the American Agriculturist, is not this vari- 
 ety with the name changed to Rye. It posseses many of 
 the objectionable qualities that are mentioned as belong- 
 ing to the orchard grass of this country. 

As I have never turned my attention to practical agri- 
 culture in this country, having chiefly led a city life, I 
 am not aware that I have ever seen a specimen of the 
 orchard grass spokon of. , Perhaps some of your nume- 
 rous readers would kindly send a few stems with roots 
 attached, to your office for inspection. 

The growing of grasses of the best varieties is of such 
 importance that no pains or expense ought to be spared 
 to ascertain which are the best. 

As to the comparative value of the Italian and English, 

I can only say, I would never grow the Italian if any 
 other could be procured. It was by a partial failure of 
 a plant of clover, and that so late in the season, that 
 English was not to be had without sending to a great 
 distance, and every day I lost being of great moment, 
 that I very unwillingly sowed the Italian, and greatly to 
 my disappointment found it had smothered what clover 
 there was, and I was left with a crop little better than 
 wheat straw. Had it not been a fine season for securing 
 it, it would have been worse and fit for nothing except 
 bedding, and that of a very bad description. At any time 
 I would rather have good Oat or Barley straw than the 
 best secured Italian Rye-grass. Had I been fortunate 
 enough to have got English I should have saved my clo- 
 ver and had a very large quantity of superior hay. If I 
 were so situated again, although it might be at a season 
 when some other crop would have to be neglected for a 
 few days, I would sacrifice what clover remained, and 
 plough the land, and sow either Tares or a good variety 
 of Pea. This would leave the land in an ameliorate 
 condition and fit for growing a fine crop of wheat. 

I am certain it would repay, gentlemen, to encourage 
 the importation of all the varieties of English Rye-grass, 
 and give them a fair trial so as to ascertain which is the 
 one best adapted to this climate. 

Do hot let that extraordinary statement made at one 
 of Mr. Mechi's, agricultural dinners (in England) by a 
 Mr. Cird, and commented upon in the May number of 
 the Journal, induce any one to try the Italian Rye-grass. 
 I will let the twenty tons per acre, be it grass or hay, 
 answer for itself, but must inform those who are igno- 
 rant of the fact, that the Scotch acre is one fourth larger 
 than either the English or American. There is one other 
 statement made by the same gentleman which I cannot 
 let pass; and that is where he mentions that it was "cut 
 ten times from March to December." I think any gen- 
 tleman who is in the least conversant with the climate of 
 Scotland will agree with me, that there could be but 
 little got from the mowings that took place in the months 
 of November and December, and also that the "humid 
 climate of Scotland" must have been a great preventa- 
 tive to its being made into hay that cattle would eat. I 
 also think two or more of the first cuttings, even if abun- 
 dant, would be exposed to the same fate as those of the 
 months of November and December. 

The experiments that are being constantly made upon 
 the "Tiptree Farm" (as Mr. Mechi pleases to call his 
 property) and the good dinners given by that gentleman, 
 are the source of startling statements as to what is, and 
 can be produced per acre. It is very rarely that three 
 crops of hay are secured in a season in the south of Eng- 
 land, where they have many more bright and clear days 
 than in Scotland. Yours truly, JOHN WM. GIBBONS.

 Intellectual Improvement of Farmers. 
 The winter is past and the vernal sun is again shed- 
 ding his balmy influence over the hill, the valley and the 
 lawn ,• the feathered songsters are now cheering us with 
 their notes of thanksgiving, and the groves are becoming 
 redolent with the foliage and flowers already bursting 
 into life.
