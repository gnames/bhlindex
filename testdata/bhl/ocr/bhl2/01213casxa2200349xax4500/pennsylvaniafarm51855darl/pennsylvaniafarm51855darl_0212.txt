Perhaps it required two weeks longer keep in the 
 spring on hay, than if the cows had been turned upon 
 an abundant pasture. They were stabled nights, being 
 put up before milking, and not turned out till after milk- 
 ing the next morning, and received evening and morning 
 as much clover as they would eat, till about the 10th of 
 August, when the first sowed corn had got its growth, 
 and could be cut without loss. Upon this they were fed 
 till near the first of December, when the corn raised on 
 the four acres was gone. That portion of it standing 
 when frost came, was cut and cured in small bundles set 
 up in shocks, upon which the cattle fed nearly as well as 
 when green. 

The corn sowed was the common yellow, but this spring 
 I am going to sow sweet corn, which I am sure will pro- 
 duce a heavier growth, and much better quality. 

The cows thus fed, gave a larger quantity of milk than 
 they have ever done upon pasture alone, and did not 
 shrink it, in the fall, from the drouth as if pastured. This 
 was very favorable to my calves, with my mode of rear- 
 ing them, which is upon skimmed milk and buttermilk 
 with a little meal in it, which they receive as long as the 
 cows give milk in the winter ; for the amount of milk for 
 them did not diminish as it would, had the cows been 
 pastured alone, and shrunk of their milk in the latter 
 part of summer. 

My cows are of the largest class, being thorough bred 
 and grade short horns, none of them less than fifteen- 
 sixteenths Durham, and would require as much feed as 
 any class of cows. 

The only drawback is the labor required to feed and 
 care for the cows. This will amount to about two hours 
 extra labor per day, say $1.00 a week, or $30.00 for 
 seven months. But this is much more than compensated 
 in the greater amount and better quality Of the manure 
 made and saved in this way. for cow's manure, dropped 
 about a pasture in summer, spoils nearly as much grass 
 the first year, unless it is taken up and carted off, as it 
 augments the growth the next year. 

In order not to mislead any one, it should be added 
 that to feed so many cattle from so small an amount of 
 land, it must be in a good condition, rich enough to yield 
 at least three tons of hay or a hundred bushels of corn 
 to the acre. Respectfully yours, Alpheus Morie, in the 
 Country Gentleman. 

Corn and Cob Meal for horses. 

One of the editors of the Michigan Farmer has been 
 experimenting on corn and cob meal, as horse feed, for 
 a couple of months, exclusively, and with the following 
 results. After one.month's feeding, febrile symptoms were 
 occasionally observed in one of the horses, such as short 
 and quick breathing &c. 

On stating the case to Dr. Dadd, the skillful veterinary 
 surgeon of Boston, it elicited the following valuable letter. 
 The importance of occasional change of food which it 
 recommends, is not sufficiently attended to by our farm- 
 ers in feeding their stock. 

i: As regards your horse, I would (if he is no better) 
 change the diet immediately. He is probably suffering 
 from acute, or perhaps chronic indigestion, which is very 
 apt to occur in animals when kept too long on one kind 
 of diet. 

No facts in dietetics is better established than that of 
 the impossibility of long sustaining health, or even life 
 on one kind of diet. It fails to support nutrition. (See 
 Liebig and Carpenter.) The animals experimented up- 
 on, after a certain length of time, seemed willing to 
 endure starvation rather than live on one kind of diet. 
 As regards the adult horse, however, he will exist for some 
 time on highly nutritious articles, such as oats, barley, 
 corn meal, &c, but they finally induce febrile diseases 
 such as laminitis (inflammation of the foot,) rheumatism, 
 founder, &c. They do not require so much of the flesh- 
 making principle as the young and growing animal, which 
 not only requires sufficient carbon in the form of food to 
 renovate the tissues, but also enough for growth and 
 development. 

The adult, however, requires a greater variety of food 
 than the latter, to support the integrity of his organiza- 
 tion, consequently as you have fed your horse on corn and 
 cob meal all icinter, there may be a disproportion between 
 the amount of carbon, (in the form of food,) and the ox- 
 ygen respired, hence his digestion must be deranged, or 
 carbon, in the form of fat, is deposited in the various 
 tissues. 

A fat horse, of course you are aware, is not the one 
 for fast work nor fatigue, and, the emaciated excepted, 
 is more likely to become sick, from the least exciting 
 cause. 

On the other hand, an excess of carbonaceous material 
 deranging the stomach — it holding sympathetic relation 
 with the brain — is apt to terminate in staggers, &c. It 
 should be known to horsemen that an adult horse ought 
 not to increase in weight from year to year ; the food 
 may be proportioned to work, any increase of flesh or 
 fat, is a signal to dip a lighter hand into the meal bag ; 
 that is, if you want to keep disease and death at bay. 

It pays to fatten cattle, sheep and swine, because the re- 
 sult, is dollars and cents, but you may depend that it is 
 losing a spec to fatten horses ; for among such I have the 
 most practice, their disease being more difficult to con- 
 trol than when occurring in others, in fair working order. 

As regards corn and cob meal, I think it operates inju- 
 riously on a gi-eat many horses. 

In the first place they do not always masticate it prop- 
 erly, it being soft and easily insalivated, they are apt to 
 bolt it, as the saying is, it then runs into fermentation, 
 resulting in flatulent or spasmodic cholic. 

In order to obviate the difficulty, the meal ought to be 
 mixed with cut hay or straw, articles that must be mas- 
 ticated ere swallowed. Should the digestive organs be 
 deranged, meal ferments very rapidly, inducing flatu- 
 lency. 

I should not object to giving a horse a feed of corn 
 and cob meal occasionally, mixing it with cut hay and a 
 little salt. Salt is a good antiseptic — prevents fermen- 
 tation — affords by the decomposition in the stomach, 
 muriatic acid and soda ; aids digestion and prevents the 
 generation of worms. 

The best remedies for restoring the digestive functions 
 are : 

Powdered Gentian, 1 oz. Powdered Ginger, i oz 
 do Salt 2 oz. do Charcoal 1 oz. 

Mix, divide into eight parts and give one with the 
 food, night and morning.
