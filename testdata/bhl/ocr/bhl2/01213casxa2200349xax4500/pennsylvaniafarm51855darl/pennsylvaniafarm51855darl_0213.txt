Seeding Thick or Thin. 

The following from one of our foreign exchanges, con- 
 tains assertions, which will be rather startling to many 
 farmers here, where thick sowing is generally adopted 
 and preferred. 

Experiments on a small scale to test their truth should 
 be made the coming fall, and next spring. 

"Repeated experiments have proved that the capabili- 
 ties of grains of corn, whether Wheat, Barley or Oats, 
 are only to be known by planting early, thinly and singly; 
 and iu order for the full development of each grain, 
 whether on poor or rich soils, it requires to be plant- 
 ed at least 3 feet apart square. Although the notion 
 of planting at this extreme distance may be ridiculed 
 and pronounced illogical by thick seeders, yet we con- 
 tend that by judicious management on good and well pre- 
 pared soils, and by planting early in September, each 
 plant of Wheat thus treated will invariably not fail to 
 produce 4000-fold, and half a pint of selected seed is thus 
 sufficient to plant 1 acre, and as a natural consequence, 
 it is, of course, quite possible to obtain a produce of 
 4000 half pints, equal to 31 bushels, and 1 peck per acre, 
 quite equal to the average yield of the United Kingdom, 
 from the opposite extreme and ordinary practice of sow- 
 ing 256 half pints, or 2 bushels of seed, and sometimes 
 more to the acre. Anomalous as this may appear, yet 
 it is certain, and defies irrefragable evidence to prove 
 the contrary, that whilst 4000-fold is thus obtainable 
 from a half pint of seed, not 30-fold is nor can possibly be 
 obtained from a full crop of 256 times the quantity, by 
 reason of its extreme thickness ; for, were it so, 30 times 2 
 bushels would be the average yield, viz., 60 bushels per 
 acre ! If our agricultural friends will take the trouble to 
 plant, or thin small plots of their wheat to about 6 inches 
 by 12 apart, or about 18 plants to the square yard (the 
 distance we believe proper for obtaining the fullest crops) 
 their expectations will be fully realized. As the season 
 is now too far advanced to prove the correctness of this 
 statement on Wheat crops, if not already done, we do 
 trust that some unprejudiced farmers will take the 
 trouble to plant, transplant, or thin singly, about a rod 
 at least of their Barley or Oats crops, in the middle of 
 their fields, when it has been up about a fortnight, and 
 afterwards keep it clean by hoeing it deeply with a hack 
 hoe ; then all their doubt of the reasonableness of this 
 expostulation will be removed. — Hardy § Son, Seed

Grasses for Lawns, 
 The extreme beauty, evenness and velvety softness of 
 English Lawns, have been the theme of admiration of 
 all travellers, through the United Kingdom. In our 
 landscape gardening, these lawns are the models we strive 
 to equal, no arrangement of trees and shrubbery and 
 otherwise picturesque location of buildings, producing 
 the proper effect, without a well set, compact and even 
 sod of green grass. It is but seldom, in this country a 
 lawn or grass plot, either large or small, is to be seen 
 what it ought to be and what it may be. The differ- 
 ence in this particular, between here and England is 
 partially owing to her more moist and humid climate, 
 but more to other causes we shall now advert to and first 
 and most especially the determination in this country to 

do every thing fast, to make excellence, beauty, durabil- 
 ity, in nearly all cases subservient to speed. We do not 
 take the time, and will not incur the expense, in our ag- 
 ricultural and horticultural operations, as well as in 
 other branches of business, to do things well, but only 
 wish to do them soon. 

In England the formation of a good lawn, intended to be 
 permanently laid down to grass, is considered an expen- 
 sive operation and one requiring the greatest skill. The 
 subsoil is first, if it requires it, thoroughly drained, and 
 the surface made entirely level. Subsoil or trench 
 plowing is of course adopted, to guard against the effect 
 of drought, and the greatest care taken during the pro- 
 cess of levelling and preparing, to give it a uniform foun- 
 dation at a uniform depth, particularly to make the upper 
 six inches, every where the same, and of a uniform strat- 
 um of good garden soil. In this way they avoid the un- 
 even spots, hills and hollows, which so disfigure our own 
 lawns, and make a variety of tints in different parts. 

A mistake is often made here, in having the soil too 
 poor to produce a constant and luxuriant growth of grass, 
 levelling being often done with the earth out of the 
 cellar of the building just erected. We would recom- 
 mend, after plowing to the depth of ten to twelve inches, 
 if the soil is thin, it should be covered with a plentiful 
 coat of good barn yard manure, to be plowed down to the 
 depth of five inches, and the surface afterwards covered 
 with good surface soil, at least a couple of inches, to 
 serve as a recipient seed bed, for the young grass seeds. 
 Much of the outlay may be reduced, where circum- 
 stances admit of taking off previously to laying down the 
 lawn a crop of potatoes, or other roots, which have the 
 effect of making the soil mellow and friable. Previous 
 to seeding, all stones must of course be picked off and 
 the harrow passed over repeatedly to pulverize all lumps 
 and reduce all inequalities. 

The fall of the year is decidedly preferable for form- 
 ing a lawn, and it is a great advantage to sow at the 
 same time with the grass seed, — a small quantity of rye, 
 wheat or oats, for protection during the winter and suc- 
 ceeding spring, but which must be mowed off, when six 
 or eight inches high, to avoid any interference with the 
 growth of the grasses. 

The quantity of grass seed used to the acre for lawn 
 purposes is much greater in England than many persons 
 seem willing to incur the expense of here. Out of six 
 different mixtures of lawn grass seed, recormnemled for 
 au acre by some English authorities, we find not one to 
 contain less than forty pounds. The last spring there 
 are some lawns near Philadelphia, we could point out, 
 where only ten pounds of seed were used, and that 
 merly raked in on a hard and sterile seed bed of clay or 
 gravel, which had neither been dug or plowed up, and 
 and yet the proprietors are greatly dissappointed, that 
 by this time, the plot has not attained the velvety soft- 
 ness and compactness of an English Park. The cause 
 is of course attributed to our unfortunate climate. 

As there is no use in more than enough, we would 
 say if the ground is properly prepared, and the above 
 precautions attended to, twenty to twenty-five lbs. of seed 
 are sufficient for an acre. 

The kind of grass seed for an American lawn or park, 
 we have a very decided opinion about, and can speak
