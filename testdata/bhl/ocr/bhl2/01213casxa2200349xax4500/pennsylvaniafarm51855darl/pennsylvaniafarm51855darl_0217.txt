ing more milk and of as rich quality. The last season I had 
 six acres of millet which has been worth more than $50 per 
 acre, or $300 for the six acres. I have fed thirty-five cows 
 on the straw since tho 25th of January, and have enough 
 left to last until the 1st of May, and got 120 bushels of seed 
 from the lot. The ripest of the seed, some sixty bushels, I 
 have sold for seed, and the balance I am now feeding my 
 horses, and find they do as well on the meal put on cut hay 
 and straw as they did when I fed an equal quantity of corn 
 and oat-meal. 

Now for the manner of raising it; I have raised it on 
 green sward, turned over at my convenience any time in the 
 fall or in the spring up to the time of sowing; I then har- 
 row until mellow, then put on from twelve to eighteen quarts 
 of seed per acre, and as much fine manure as I can spare, 
 from five to fifteen good wagon loads per acre, and sow 
 about the middle of June, and I am sure to have double the 
 amount of hay that the same land in similar condition 
 would produce in meadow. It will stand the drouth better 
 than any other crop I ever raised; in fact, it wants hot, dry 
 weather for it to grow in ; if it is moist enough for it to 
 to come up, there is but little danger, as the last two years 
 have proved. After the seed is sown and well dragged or 
 cultivated, the ground should be well rolled, as we get a 
 good deal of dry weather about that time, and if not rolled 
 it may be too dry for the seed to grow; but after it is once 
 up, I think there is but little danger of a failure of a crop. 
 Tho time of cutting that I have practised is, as soon as I get 
 through with my oats — say the last of August, or when 
 about half of the heads have seed matured enough to grow. 
 Tho stalk will be green and full of juice. I cradle it, let it 
 lay one or two days to wilt, and stack it up as I do oats, put 
 on a cap, and let it cure in the stack ; it will then be as 
 bright as the best toppings of corn, and any animal will eat 
 it as readily as any other forage. — T. B. Shepard, in Gen- 
 esee Farmer. 

Plea for the Birds. 

The Norwich Examiner, in a notice of Hovey's Magazine 
 for February, says : 

'•Wilson Flagg continues his plea for tho birds and cer- 
 tainly makes out a very plausible argument for the crows 
 and blackbirds, which have been too long put under ban by 
 the sapient legislatives of New England. It is among our 
 earliest recollections, living in the family of a Justice of the 
 Peace, that the farmers' boys brought young crows by the 
 basketful, to receive the bounty upon them. The cry of 
 theso poor birdlings, just taken from their nests in the deep 
 forests, and with the down of infancy upon their half covered 
 skins, haunted our boyish imagination for months after the 
 sacrifice. It seemed a most inhuman butchery. The boun- 
 ties so thinned out the crows, and insects increased to such 
 an extent, that some of the States were obliged to offer 
 counter rewards for the protection of the crows. 

"The red wing crow and blackbirds live to a great extent 
 upon grub-worms, caterpillars and other larvae — the silent, 
 but deadly enemy of all vegetation, and whose secret and 
 insidious attacks are more to be dreaded than the combined 
 mischief of all the feathered tribes put together. It is re- 
 ported that when the locusts had been accidentally intro- 
 duced into the isle of Bourbon, and had spread so as to de- 
 stroy vegetation, a few grackles introduced from India soon 
 multiplied so as to exterminate them. The wood-peckers 
 and tho night-hawks are also shown to be very useful birds, 

"Who would grudge the common robin his feast of cher- 
 ries, or the blackbird his grains of corn, if he were at once 
 convinced that the services of these birds, and others, are 
 all that can save our crops from destruction, and the world 

from famine. They are profitable servants, who glean a 
 tribute from our orchards and cornfields, as the wages of their 
 labor; and if we could make an exact estimate of the amount 
 of service they perform, we should find them abundantly 
 worthy of their hire. If the poor bird who is outlawed for 
 a little mischief he is supposed to do, should present his 
 bill containing an enumeration in figures of the amount of 
 grubs and insects ho had destroyed, we should probably be 
 startled at our own indebtedness, and be willing to pay him 
 more liberally than he pays himself, for the continuance of 
 his services." 

Save Your Plums Now. 

Wo begin to think this can be done without Mr. Matthews, 
 if not with him. We were yesterday on the grounds of one 
 of our best horticulturists, and saw the application, and have 
 some faith in its success. Our friend thinks there is no 
 chance for mistake about its efficacy. He informed us that 
 he applied it last year, after the curculio had begun its rav- 
 ages, and that it not only saved those which were unstung, 
 but many of the plums on which the insect had left his 
 card, healed and ripened well. The liquid enters the opened 
 wound and destroys the egg. This is the only remedy he 
 has ever found to avail against this slippery enemy of one 
 of our best fruits. His recipe is — One peck of unslacked 
 lime, six pounds of salt, one barrel of water. The mixture 
 is to be applied with a common garden syringe. If one ap- 
 plication is not sufficient, repeat it. A singlo application 
 answered with him last year 

No time is to be lost, as the young plums are already set, 
 and the enemy has begun to show himself. If a syringe is 
 not to be had, sprinkle on the liquid in some other way. 
 The mixture is cheap and easily applied, and every man who 
 has a plum tree sho/ild try it. This is the most philosoph- 
 ical remedy we have yet seen suggested, and we commend 
 it with more confidence than most new things to tho notice 
 of fruit growers. If it answers our expectations, it will be 
 worth millions to the country. Plums can be grown on 
 loose, sandy loams as well as on clay soils, to which they 
 have hitherto been mainly confined, on account of the rava- 
 ges of this insect. The cultivation of this fruit may bo in- 
 definitely extended, and we may make our own dried plums 
 instead of importing them from France. 

Those who have Mr. Matthews' remedy in keeping 
 should hurry up their secret, or they will be too late for the 
 fair. — American Agriculturist. 

Hay for Cows in Summer. 

An observing intelligent and successful farmer informs us 
 that he is in the practice of feeding his cows with hay in 
 summer, particularly if the season is such as to afford flush 
 pastures. His reasoning is that a full, rapid and vigorous 
 growth of grass gives to cattle that feed upon it, a desiro for 
 something to absorb the excess of tho juice in their food. 
 Dry hay they devour greedily, and though in over so small 
 quantities, evidently with the most beneficial effects. Every 
 farmer must have observed that in dry seasons, horses, cattle 
 and sheep, keep in good condition upon herbage parched 
 and apparently scant, while in wet seasons, in tall pastures, 
 though always full, the process of fattening with them was 
 slow. Dry fodder in such cases is required to give substance 
 and tenacity to the green, and can be profitably used by 
 feeding it to horses and cattle. — Neicburgh Telegraph. 

We clip the above from the Rural New Yorker, and do 
 not remember ever to have seen or heard the observation 
 before about dry hay in summer for stock. It strikes us there 
 is sound philosophy in the theory. We have often noticed 
 our cows eating dry herbage in the midst of plentiful pasture,
