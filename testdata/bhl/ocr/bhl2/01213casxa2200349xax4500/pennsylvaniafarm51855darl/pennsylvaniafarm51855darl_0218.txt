THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[July 

but the reason why, never occurred to us. This is one of 
 the eases, where a practical hint of much value may be 
 gleaned by the farmer from his agricultural paper. 

Why there is no Rain in Peru. 
 In Peru, South America, rain is unknown. The coast of 
 Peru is within the region of perpetual south-east trade winds. 
 Though the Peruvian shores are on the verge of the great 
 South Sea boiler, yet it never rains there. The reason is 
 plain. The southeast trade winds in the Atlantic ocean first 
 strike the water on the coast of Africa. Travelling to the 
 northwest, they blow obliquely across the ocean until they 
 reach the coast of Brazil. By this time they are heavily 
 laden with vapor, which they continue to bear along across 
 the continent, depositing it as they go, and supplying with 
 it the sources of the Rio de la Plata and the southern tribu- 
 taries of the Amazon. Finally they reach the snow capped 
 Andes, and here is wrung from them the last particle of 
 moisture that that very low temperature can extract. Reach- 
 ing the summit of that range, they now tumble down as cool 
 and dry winds on the Pacific slopes beyond. Meeting with 
 no evaporating surface, and with no temperature colder than 
 that to which they were subjected on the mountain tops, 
 they reach the ocean before they become charged with fresh 
 vapor, and before, therefore, they have any which the Peru- 
 vian climate can extract. Thus we see how the top of the 
 Andes become the reservoir from which are supplied the 
 rivers of Chili and Peru. — [Lieut. Maury's Geography of the 
 Sea. 

The Late Thomas Bates of Englmd. 

The fact is, that he possessed that intuitive genius, with- 
 out which no man can hope to rise above a bungler in the 
 difficult art of breeding. With this he united long experi- 
 ence, and a degree of enthusiasm which no difficulties could 
 repress, no failures could daunt. He loved his cattle for 
 their own sake, not for the money he might happen to make 
 by them ; above all, he never forgot the character of the ani- 
 mal he was dealing with. He insisted on a cow being a cow, 
 and not a mere oblong box of fat. Hence the charm of his 
 herd, of which every individual has a character which when 
 once studied will never be forgotten. Hence he did not, as 
 some breeders do, neglect the milking qualities of his favor- 
 ites, for he well knew that a first rate animal may both milk 
 and feed. 

From my own experience, I find the cows of Mr. Bates' 
 blood the best thrivers on hard keep and in an exposed situ- 
 ation I ever possessed. The popular notion that highbred 
 animals are tenderer than mongrels is a mistake, arising in 
 great measure from the injudicious nursing they too fre- 
 quently receive. I never pamper my short-horns, and, there- 
 fore, when removed from my farm it would be difficult to 
 find a situation on which they would not thrive, or food on 
 which they would not keep their condition. — Willoughby 
 Wood, in Agricultural Gazette. 

How to Prevent Weevil. 
 We are informed by Mr. Chamberlain, of the City Mill, 
 that the farmers of Vermont are in the habit of heading the 
 movements of the weevil, by a simple process. The next 
 season after it makes its appearance, they go through their 
 wheat fields, about the time the wheat is heading, immedi- 
 ately after a shower or while the dew is on it, and scatter 
 newly slacked lime broad cast, so that it will adhere to the 
 heads and stems of the grain. They use about a bushel to 
 the acre. Good lime should be secured, and slacked by 
 sprinkling a little water over it so as to retain all its strength. 
 A paddle may be used in scattering it The remedy has, it 

is said, been so effectually tried, as to leave no doubt of the 
 result. Strips in largo wheat fields left untouched by the 
 lime, for experiment, have been entirely destroyed by the 
 weevil, while the grain on each side was all saved. 

Since this intelligence was received, Mr. Jesso Allen, of 
 the Centre Mill, has received corroborating information from 
 a Muskingum county farmer, who had seen tho same prac- 
 tice and the same results there. — Akron Beacon. 

A Speculator Cured. 

Once on a time a country Dutchman early one morning 
 went to town, where by chance he overheard some traders 
 telling each other how much money they had made that 
 morning by speculation ; one of them had made $100, $200, 
 $500, &c. Han's bump of inquisitiveness was so excited 
 that he, without any reflection, forthwith concluded to leave 
 his former business, which was labor, and try his hand at 
 speculation, and on his return home made known his inten- 
 tions to his faithful vrow. Early next morning he gathered 
 his wallet containing his funds, amounting to five dollars, 
 and off he goes post haste and half bent to look up a spec- 
 ulation. He had not proceeded far when he met a wagoner, 
 and accosted him thus : 

"Good morning, Mr. Wagoner, I wants to speculate a 
 leetle dish morning wid you." ''Well, say," said the wag- 
 oner, "how do you want to speculate?" "Well," says the 
 Dutchman, "I will bet fife dollars you can't guess what my 
 dog's name ish." "Call him up till I look at him;" rejoined 
 the wagoner. Dutchman — "H-er-e Va-tch, he-re Wa-tch, 
 he-re Va-tch," the wagoner eyes him for a moment and said, 
 "I guess his name is Watch." Dutchman — "O besure, Mr. 
 Wagoner, you has won him, de monish is yours," and Han's 
 returned to his old occupation perfectly satisfied. 

Great Yield of Cucumbers. 

Mr. Daniel Morse, of Lockport, N. Y., writes to the South- 
 ern Farmer as follows : 

For the benefit of your readers, I give you the production 
 of eight hills of cucumbers, planted in my garden last spring. 
 The manner of planting was taken from one of the agricul- 
 tural journals. 

Having fully prepared a good garden soil by repeated 
 spadings, I placed barrels at a distance each way of eight 
 feet, and about six inches in the ground. The barrels were 
 then filled with barnyard manure, and seeds previously 
 soaked for 24 hours planted around, and about four inches 
 from the barrels. After tho plants made their appearance, 
 and when there had been no rain during the day, two pails 
 of water were put on the manure in each barrel every night, 
 which found its way through holes bored in the lower head. 
 About four plants were left to each of the eight barrels. The 
 end of each vine was pinched off just before fruiting. Now 
 for the result and number of each picking.

An Umbrageous Oak. 
 There is an oak tree near Raleigh, N. C, which, at the 
 sun's meridian, covers with shade a space of 9,000 feet. It 
 would afford shelter for 4,500 men.
