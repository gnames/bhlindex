The Plum Weevil, or Curculio. 
 We mako the following extract from the report of Mr. 
 Townsend Glover on the curculio, which will be published 
 in the forthcoming agricultural report of the Patent Office : 
 'Tho plum weevil, or curculio, (rhyncheenus nenuphar,) is 
 one of the most destructive insects that the horticulturist 
 has to fear, not to plums alono, but to cherries, nectarines, 
 and apples, which are indiscriminately attacked; and in the 
 more Southern States, peaches also suffer much from the 
 larvae of a weevil of this kind, of similar habits and shape, 
 if not identically tho same. The perfect curculio is about 
 two-tenths of an inch in length, of a dark brown color, with 

a spot of yellowish "white on the hind part of each wing case. 
 The head is furnished with a long curved snout or bill, with 
 which it is enabled to bore into the unripe fruit by means of 
 jaws placed at the end of this bill. The wing cases, which 
 are rigid, uneven, and humped, cover two transparent wings, 
 by which the perfect weevil is enabled to fly from tree to 
 tree; but when these wing cases are closed, the back ap- 
 pears without any surface or division, which has led to the 
 vory erroneous idea among farmers that the insect cannot 
 fly. When disturbed, or shaken from the tree, it is so simi- 
 lar in appearance to a dried bud that it can scarcelybe dis- 
 tinguished, especially when feigning death, which it always 
 does when alarmed. As soon as the plums are of the size 
 of peas, the weevil commences the work of destruction by 
 making a semi-circular cut through the skin with her long 
 curved snout, in the apex of which cut she deposits & single 
 egg. She then goes to another plum, which is treated in a 
 similar manner, until she has exhausted her whole stock of 
 eggs. The grubs which are hatched by the heat of tho sun, 
 immediately eat their way to the stone in an oblique direc- 
 tion, where they remain gnawing the interior until the fruit 
 is weakened and diseased, and by this treatment falls from 
 the tree. The grub, which is a small, yellowish, footless, 
 white maggot, then leaves the fallen fruit, enters tho earth, 
 changes into a pupa, and in the first brood comes to the sur- 
 face again, in about three weeks, as a perfect weevil, to pro- 
 pagato its species and destroy more fruit. It has not yet 
 been decided whether the latest generation of the weevil 
 remains in the ground all winter in the grub or in the pupa 
 state. Dr. E. Sanborn, of Andovor, Massachusetts, asserts, 
 however, that the grubs, after having entered the earth, re- 
 turn to the surface in about six weeks as perfect weevils, 
 which must remain hidden in crevices until spring. The 
 most popular opinion is that they remain in the larvae or 
 pupa state. The worm or grub is often found in tho knots 
 or oxcrescences which disfigure and destroy plum trees, and 
 has been wrongfully accused of being the eause of these 
 swellings; but it is highly probable that the weevil, finding 
 in the young knots an acid somewhat similar to that of the 
 unripe fruit, merely deposits its eggs therein as the nearest 
 substitute for tho real plum. 

"Some of the remedies recommended for preventing the 
 ravages of these insects are actually absurd, such as tying 
 cotton round the trees in order to prevent them from ascen- 
 ding, when it is known that they are furnished with wings, 
 and fly from tree to tree with the greatest ease. Among tho 
 remedies at present in use one is to cover the fruit with a 
 coating of white-wash, mixed with a little glue, appliod by 
 means of a syringe ; another is to spread a sheet upon tho 
 ground under the tree, and then jar the principal branches 
 suddenly with a mallet covered with cloth, so as not to bruise 
 the bark, when the perfect insects will fall into the sheet 
 and feign death, and may be gathered and destroyed. Hogs 
 are sometimes turned into plum orchards, where, by eating 
 the fallen and diseased fruit, they materially lessen the evil. 
 Coops of thickens placed under the trees, and the branches 
 often shaken, the insects fall, and are eagerly seized and de- 
 voured. All fallen fruit should be gathered up several times 
 in the course of the season and burnt, or given to hogs, or 
 destroyed in some other way. By so doing thousands Of the 
 grubs which have not yet left the plums are destroyed; but, 
 as yet, no thoroughly practical remedy has been made pub- 
 lic, and the above are merely mentioned as being useful in 
 small gardens containing only a few trees." 

Beware.— Were it not that we have already heard of sev- 
 eral deaths from drinking immoderately of cold water in this 
 hot season, wo' should think a caution unnecessary.
