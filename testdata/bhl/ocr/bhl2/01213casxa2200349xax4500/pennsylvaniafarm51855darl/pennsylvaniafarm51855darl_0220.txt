19. All obstacles, present in the soil, which hinder the 
 Solution and absorbability of the plant-food, proportionally 
 destroy its ability to serve as food; they make the plant- 
 food ineffective. A certain physical state of the soil is a 
 needful preliminary condition to the efficacy of the food 
 therein contained. The soil must allow the access of air 
 and moisture, and permit the roots of plants to extend them- 
 selves in all directions, and seek out their nutriment. The 
 expression, telluric conditions, comprises every thing neces- 
 sary to vegetable growth, that depends upon the physical 
 qualities and composition of the soil. 

20. All plants need as nourishment phosphoric acid, sul- 
 phuric acid, the alkalies, lime, magnesia, and iron. Certain 
 families of plants require silica; those that grow on the sea 
 shore, and in the sea itself, require common salt, soda, and 
 iodine. In some families of plants the alkalies may be in 
 part replaced by lime and magnesia, and vice versa. All 
 these bodies are collectively designated as mineral food. 
 The atmospheric food ot plants is carbonic acid and ammo- 
 nia. Water serves itself as food and also as a general medi- 
 um of nutrition. 

21. The bodies that are necessary as food for the plant, 
 have an equal value in this respect, i. e. if any one of the 
 entire number be wanting the plant cannot flourish. 

22. Fields which are adapted to the cultivation of all spe- 
 cies of plants, contain all the soil-ingredients that are neces- 
 sary for these plants; the words poor or unfruitful, and rich 
 or fruitful, express the relations of these soil-ingredients in 
 quantity or quality. 

Among qualitative differences, are understood differences 
 in the solubility of the mineral ingredients, or in their capa- 
 bility of entering the vegetable structure through the agency 
 of water. 

Of two soils which contain equal quantities of mineral 
 food, one may be fruitful (considered as rich), the other un- 
 fruitful (considered as poor), when in the latter these nutri- 
 tive substances aro not free, but exist in the state of chemi- 
 cal compound. A body in chemical combination, opposes, 
 by its attraction for the bodies it is combined with, an ob- 
 stacle to another body that tends to unite with it. This 
 opposition must be overcome before the two will unite. 

23. All soils adapted for cultivation, contain the mineral 
 nutritive matters in both these forms. Taken together they 
 represent the capital of the soil; the freely soluble parts are 
 the movable or available capital. 

24. The improvement — enriching, making fruitful — of a 
 soil by proper means, but without addition of mineral plant- 
 food, implies a conversion of a part of the inactive, unavail- 
 able capital, into a form available for the plant. 

25. The mechanical operations of tillage, have the object 
 to overcome chemical obstacles, to set free and render di- 
 rectly useful the plant-food that is in insoluble chemical 
 combination. This object is accomplished through the co- 
 operation of the atmosphere, of carbonic acid, oxygen and 
 water. This action is called weathering. The presence of 
 standing water in tho soil, which cuts off the access of the 
 atmosphere to the chemical compounds in tho soil, hinders 
 the process of weathering. 

26. Fallow is the period of weathering. During fallow, 
 by means of air and rain, carbonic acid and ammonia are 
 added to the soil. The latter remains there when substan- 
 ces are present capable of fixing it, i. e. depriving it of vol- 
 atility. 

27. A soil is fruitful for a given species of plant, when it 
 contains the mineral substances needed by that plant in 

proper quantity and proportion, and in a form adapted for 
 entering it. 

28. When this soil has become unfruitful by continued 
 use, by the removal of a series of crops without replacing 
 the mineral ingredients carried off, it will recover its pro- 
 ductiveness for this kind of plant, by lying one or more sea- 
 sons in fallow, if, in addition to the soluble and removed 
 ingredients, it had contained a certain store of the same 
 substances in an insoluble form, which, during the fallow, 
 by mechanical division and weathering, are capable of be- 
 coming soluble. By tho so-called green manuring, this result 
 is effected in a shorter time. 

29. A field which does not contain these mineral forms of 
 plant-food, cannot become fruitful by lying in fallow. 

30. The increase of tho productiveness of a field by fallow 
 and tillage, and the removal of soil-ingredients in the crops, 
 without a return of the latter, brings about, in shorter or 
 longer time, a state of permanent unfruitfulness. 

31. In order that the fertility of a soil be permanent, the 
 removed substances must be replaced at certain intervals, i. 
 e. its original composition must be re-established. 

32. Various species of plants require the same kinds of 
 mineral food to their development ; but in unlike quantities, 
 or at different times. Some cultivated plants need that silioa 
 be present in soluble form in the soil. 

33. When a given field contains a certain amount of all 
 kinds of mineral plant-food in equal proportion, and in suit- 
 able form, it will become unproductive of a single species of 
 plant, so soon as, in consequence of continuous cropping, 
 any single kind of plant-food, e. g. soluble silica, is so far 
 exhausted that its quantity is insufficient for a new crop. 

34. A second plant which does not require this ingredient 
 (silica e. g. ), will yield one or more crops on the same soil, 
 because the other, for it necessary, ingredients, although in 
 changed proportions, (i. o. not in equal quantities) are yet 
 present in quantity sufficient for its perfect development. 

After the second, a third kind of plant will flourish in the 
 same field, if the remaining soil-ingredients be enough for 
 its wants; and if, during the growth of these kinds of plants, 
 a new supply of the wanting plant-food (soluble silica) has 
 been made available by weathering, then, the other condi- 
 tions being as before, the first plant will again flourish. 

35. On the unequal quantity and quality of the mineral 
 ingredients of the soil, and on the differing proportions in 
 which they serve as food for the different kinds of plants, is 
 based tho alternation or rotation of crops, in general, as well 
 as the peculiar method according to which it is carried out. 

26. Other things being equal, the growth of a plant, its 
 increase in bulk, and its perfect development in a given time, 
 stand in relation to the surface of tho organs whose function 
 it is to tako up the food of the plant. The quantity of plant- 
 food that is derived from the atmosphere, depends upon the 
 number and surface of the leaves ; that which is taken from 
 the soil, upon the number and surface of the roots. 

37. If to tWo plants of the same species, during the forma- 
 tion of leaves and roots, an unequal amount of nourishment 
 be offered in the same space of time, their increase of mass 
 is unequal in this time. That plant which has received more 
 food increases more, its development is facilitated. The 
 same difference in growth is manifest, when two plants re- 
 ceive the same amount of food, but in unlike forms as to 
 solubility. 

The rapidity of the development of a plant is facilitated 
 by furnishing it with all the necessary atmospheric and tel- 
 luric nutritive matters in proper form and at the right time. 
 The conditions that shorten the time of development, are 
 the same as those that contribute to its amount.
