 together in a given time, in order that the plant attain full 
 development in this time. The more rapidly a plant devel- 
 ops itself in a given period, the more food does it need in 
 that time. Annuals require more rapid supplies than peren-

The New Rochelle Blackberry. 

BY U., ADRIAN, MICH. 

Having recently visited New Rochelle, "Westchester co., 
 N. Y., and there learned many particulars respecting the 
 discovery of the New JRocJtelle or (as it is more commonly 
 called ) Lawton Blackberry, I take the liberty to make this 
 communication, in the hope that eventual///, though tardily, 
 proper credit may be given to the person to whom the public 
 are really indebted for the discovery and preservation of 
 this remarkable fruit. 

In the year 1S34, Mr. Lewis A. Seacor, then and now re- 
 siding in the village of New Rochelle, found, on a farm now 
 owned by F. Prince, Esq., a clump of Blackberry bushes 
 bearing fruit of uncommon size, which differed much in 
 shape and appearance from any he had ever seen. Four or 
 five years afterward, having purchased a lot for a residence, 
 he recollected these Blackberries, went to the field, dug up 
 and transplanted several of them into his garden. "When 
 in due time these bushes bore fruit, Mr. S. says his neigh- 
 bors were greatly surprised, and, attributing the difference 
 in size and shape from the common fruit to cultivation alone, 
 several of them supplied themselves with the common wild 
 plants from the fields, expecting to gather fruit equally 
 large as Mr. Seacor's. In this expectation they were dis- 
 appointed, and after a few years' trial tho plants which had 
 been so carefully cultivated were dug up and thrown away 
 as worthless. Mr. S. now supplied several of his neighbors 
 with plants from his garden, and the fruit became generally 
 known in his vicinity. 

Seven or eight years ago, Mr. Lawton (after whom the 
 fruit has been named) saw some of these Blackberries in the 
 garden of a neighbor, inquired where the roots were obtained, 
 Ac. He bought plants of Mr. Seacor, was told by him where 
 t&ey were found, the circumstances of their discovery, &c. 
 In 1853, at a meeting of the Farmers' Club, in the city of 
 New York, Mr. Lawton presented a quantity of these Black- 
 berries, which were greatly admired. He also at that time 
 read a paper before the Club, in which he says, (I quote 
 from a report of his remarks published in the newspapers,) 
 "it [this fruit] has been cultivated in small quantities for 
 several years in New Rochelle, where I now reside. I have 
 not been able to ascertain who first discovered the plant and 
 brought it into garden culture, but am informed it was found 
 on tho roadside, and thence introduced into the neighboring 
 gardens." The Farmers' Club passed a vote of thanks to 
 Mr. Lawton, and named the fruit the "â– Lawton Blackberry." 
 The Pomological Convention, which assembled in Boston 
 last year, also use the same name in their list of fruits; so 
 that it is likely to be perpetuated, unless the facts in the 
 case are known. Ask any person in New Rochelle, acquainted 
 with the fruit, as to its origin, and you will be told Mr. 
 Seacor was the discoverer. 

It may be well to mention that Mr. Prince, the present 
 owner of the farm where the fruit was found, in making 
 some improvements on his land, destroyed the original 
 bushes, without knowing anything of the existence of such 
 fruit on his premises ; so that but for Mr. Seacoi's efforts, 
 the fruit would have become extinct. 

Now, if his agency in preserving this valuable fruit has 
 not been of a character sufficiently meritorius to make it 
 proper that it should bear his name, there is certainly no 
 reason why it should bear Mr. Lawton's. But it may be 
 asked, "What's in a name?" to which I answer, in this case, 
 much. By getting his name affixed to the fruit, Mr. Lawton 
 does not merely (to use a common phrase) "steal another 
 man's thunder," but he is placed in a situation to make a 
 great deal of money out of it. Persons, unacquainted with 
 tho above facts, wishing to obtain this Blackberry, would 
 naturally say, "Who so likely to furnish the genuine Lawton 
 Blackberry, as Mr. Lawton himself?" And I find for the 
 year past he has been selling the plants at ten dollars the 
 dozen (double the price charged by Mr. Seacor) ; and al- 
 though in the end he may not win golden opinions, he is 
 likely to win plenty of golden dollars, which perhaps he 
 may value more. 

I would suggest that the New York or Brooklyn Horticul- 
 tural Society investigate this matter, and let justice be done; 
 the parties live in their immediate vicinity. 

There have been many conjectures as to the origin of this 
 fruit. It is known that a relative of a former proprietor of 
 the farm brought shrubbery with him from England, and 
 some suppose this Blackberry was then introduced; others 
 think the Huguenots, who originally settled New Rochelle, 
 brought it with them from Franco; but the prevalent belief 
 appears to be that it is an accidental seedling. 

For the facts embodied in this letter, I am indebted to a 
 communication from Frederick Prince, Esq., (the present 
 owner of the farm where the fruit was found,) published in 
 tho Westchester News, and to the verbal statements of Mr. 
 Seacor and some of his neighbors; and I have every reason 
 to believe all these statements to be substantially correct.

A New Vegetable. 

Tho first substantial result of the Gadsden treaty purchase 
 from Mexico, is the promise of a vegetable known as "Am- 
 mabroma Sonorse," or the Sand Food of Sonora, which is 
 said to abound in the acquired territory. It is described as 
 a parasitic plant, with a largo and fleshy root. It is cooked 
 by roasting on hot coals, and it much resembles the sweet 
 potato, having a great deal of saccharine matter in it. It 
 may also be dried and used for the table, and it is in this way 
 alone we can hope to taste it, for Prof. Torrey, who has 
 examined it, thinks it cannot be grown out of Sonora, unless 
 the root to -which it attaches itself can also bo transplanted. 

For the benefit of scientific readers, we add that Prof. 
 Torrey,. as the result of his examination of the Ammabroma 
 finds it to constitute "a new genus of the small group or fami- 
 ly represented by thelittleknown and anomalous Corallojihyl- 
 lum of Kouth and the Pholisma of Nutall; in the floral struc- 
 ture and the scales, more like the latter from which it is dis- 
 tinguished by its wooly plumose calyx, and its singular cy- 
 thiform inflorescence." These are hard words to swallow, 
 but Mr. A. B. Gray, who has tried the vegetable, found it not 
 at all hard to take, and thinks that it may become as much of 
 a favorite on the table as the sweet potato or asparagus. It 
 is for this great prospective vegetable that the United States 
 Government has paid ten millions of dollars, and we hope 
 hereafter there will be no further question of the wisdom of 
 ourdiplomacy.
