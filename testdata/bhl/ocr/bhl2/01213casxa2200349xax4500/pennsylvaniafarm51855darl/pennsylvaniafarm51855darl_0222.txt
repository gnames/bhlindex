 First Trial of Mowers in 1855. 

A great trial of Mowing Machines took place on the 15th 
 and 16th of June, on the farm of J. S. Dickenson, of Bedford, 
 Westchester co., N. T., and on the estate of Judge Jay, of 
 the same place. Eleven Machines were entered. One of 
 Eetchum's built by Howard & Co., of Buffalo. One do. built 
 by Messrs. Hull, of Poughkeepsie, N. T., and one one-horse 
 Mower, also Ketchum's patent, built by Ruggles Nourse, Ma- 
 son & Co., of Boston. Oue of Manny's Combined Reapers 
 and Mowers built by Ball & Co., of Hoosic Falls, N. Y., and 
 two more of the same patent built, with some alleged improve- 
 ments by Adrain, of Boston. One of Allen s built by R. S. 
 Allen of New York. One of Russet's built at Boston and 
 entered by Mr. Lease, of Albany. One of Forbush's Com- 
 bined Reaper and Mower's built by the American Mowing 
 Machine Manufacturing Company of Buffalo, and one of 
 Hallenback's built by Deering & Dickinson of Albany. The 
 order of the first day was each Machino to mow two swaths 
 operated by the same team and driver, and subsequently each 
 Machine to mow a given portion of meadow, operated as 
 might be desired by the exhibitor. The machine first entered 
 was Ketchum's by Howard & Co. Weight 650 lbs. iron frame 
 with two sets of gears. Cutters three and a quarter inches 
 long and vibrating thirty-six times in passing over nine feet 
 of ground. Trial first cut, clean and well, but worked rather 
 heavily and left the grass slightly tangled ; second cut work- 
 ed similarly. The second Machine operated was Russel's. 
 Weight about 700 lbs wood frame with wheel in addition to 
 driving wheel. Motion transmitted to the cutters by a cam 
 wheel instead of by a crank as in all the other machines. 
 This wheel is about twenty inches in diameter and communi- 
 cates four vibrations to the cutter in each of its revolutions, 
 and it must be confessed, is rather noisy in its operations. 
 The cutters instead of vibrating in a straight line, as do 
 those of all the other machines, vibrate on pivots passing 
 through their centres — the end of each cutter thus describing 
 a curve almost a semicircle — vibrating thirty-two times in 
 passing over nine feet. Trial first cut, but passing well, but 
 delivered rather imperfectly, and before arriving at the end 
 of the field had accumulated such an amount of grass on the 
 guard car that it cut rather long and straglingly. In mow- 
 ing the second cut the operation differed but, little from that 
 of the first. It is perhaps due to this machine to report that 
 its exhibitor, at this time, observed that during the whole 
 time of its trial there blew quite a gust of wind bending the 
 grass away from the cutters, and that had the machine been 
 driven in a contrary direction, it would have he, said, ope- 
 rated perfectly. 

The Machine next entered was Manny's by Adrian, 
 as above. Weight 800 lbs., wood frame with two sets of 
 gears, and reel which taken with all its connexions, em- 
 braces a rather complicated looking apparatus. Length of 
 cutter two and three-quarter inches, and cuts twenty-eight 
 times in passing over seven and a half foet. Trial first cut, 
 mowed well, but worked rather more heavily than Ketchum's 
 and cut not quite so low. Second cut, stopped once and cut 
 rather long and straglingly. One of these two Machines be- 
 ing driven against the wind mowed rather better than the 
 other. The next Machine operated was Forbush's. Weight 
 of Combined Machine 900 lbs., of Mower alone, 700 lbs., 
 wood triangular shaped frame with two sets of gears and 
 reel and apparatus something similar to the two last tried. 
 Length of cutter two and three-quarter inches, vibrating 
 twenty-eight times in passing over nine feet. Trial first cut, 
 out well on starting, then clogged and cut long and strag- 
 lingly. Second cut, the driver walked and the Machine op- 
 erated rather better. The next Machino entered was Hal- 

lenback's. Weight 500 lbs., wood frame, one set of gears, 
 and altogether very simple in its design and construction. 
 Length of cutters three and three-eighth inches, vibrating 
 thirty times in passing over ten feet. Trial first cut, cut with 
 hardly any perceptible labor to the horses and very quietly 
 and effectively, leaving the grass behind'it, perfectly paral- 
 lel. Second cut, cut (as everybody in the field said) most 
 excellently. The next Machine operated was Manny's by 
 Ball & Co. Weight of Combined Machino, 800 lbs., of 
 Mower alone 700 lbs., wood frame with two sets of gears and 
 reel, with the usual accompanying, rather complicated look- 
 ing apparatus. Length of cutter two and three-quarter 
 inches, vibrating twenty eight times in passing over seven 
 and a half feet. Trial first cut, draws heavy — horses work 
 rather laboriously, but the Machino cuts well, leaving the 
 grass, however, slightly stragling. Second cut not material- 
 ly different from the first. Perhaps it should bo reported 
 that this Machino cuts five feet wide, while the other Ma- 
 chines cut but about four and a half each. The next Machine 
 worked was Ketchum's by the Messrs. Hull, which with 
 the exception of a greater noise, and rather more labor to 
 the horses, cut and laid the grass quite as well as Hallen- 
 beck's. The last Machine tried was Kotchum's one horse Ma- 
 chino, which, cutting a swath about two and a half feet wide 
 operated about the same as Ketchum's as above, by Howard 
 & Co. The trial proceeded, according to the order given 
 above, during the whole afternoon and the next forenoon on 
 the lawn in front of the residence of Judge Jay, but as 
 each of the Machines continued to operate very much as in 
 the first trial it is unnecessary to proceed with details. Hal- 
 lenbeck's and Ketchum's by the Messrs. Hull were decided- 
 ly the two best Machines on the grounds. In reforence to 
 the single gearing of the former, Mr. Ketchum, remarked 
 that in 1848 and 9, he had tried such a system of gearing 
 sufficiently to prove to himself and friends that it could not 
 bo made to answer the purpose; to which a bystander re- 
 plied that "according to his, Mr. Ketchum's admission, the 
 cutting apparatus was exceedingly imperfect compared to 
 what it is at present, and that if he should now try the one 
 set of gears he would certainly find that with his improved 
 and perfect guard-bar, guards and cutters it would operate 
 quite as effectively as the double gearing ; and so, of course, 
 with less noise, with far less labor to tho horses, and with 
 less of an uneasy and tiresome vibration communicated to 
 the seat of the driver." With this perfected guard-bar, these 
 perfected guards and cutters, it is altogether unnecessary". 
 Mr. Hallenbeck affirms, "to have more than one set of 
 gears," while after the trial, the farmers' argument in its fa- 
 vor was that "it was easy on the horses and operated first 
 rate." 

During a recess of the trial S. B. Johnson Esq. of the State 
 Agricultural Society, delivered a highly interesting and in- 
 sructive address, while during the entire time of tho trial — 
 meal times, evenings, and nights the farmers livings in the 
 vicinity, were kind gentlemanly and hospitable.

Mowing Machines 
 The late trial in Westchester co. New York : — I have just 
 received the manuscript Report of the Judges appointed for 
 the above trial, (being substantially published in your paper 
 of the 21st inst.,) which gives me tho opportunity of correct- 
 ing from an official document the report which appeared in 
 the Tribune of the 16th inst. with regard to Allen's Mowing 
 Machine. Your last says :— "The bar that holds the knives 
 appears to run low, but it does not cut as close as some of 
 the other machines, aud does not work as easily. It may do 
 better in heavy grass, but with three of the principal men of 
 the manufacturer's to direct its operations, it did not give
