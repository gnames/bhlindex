As Professor Way, is one of the highest authorities 
 in England on scientific agricultural topics, we hope our 
 friends around Philadelphia who are dairymen, will give 
 their opinion of this new theory. 

Pedigrees of Stock. — Herd Book Animals. 

While improved stock are bringing their present ex- 
 traordinary prices, which appear likely to continue for 
 some time to come, it seems desirable that the subject of 
 Pedigrees should be well understood. There is a vast 
 deal of misconception about it, often to rather an amu- 
 sing extent. Many an animal of fine appearance sells 
 at comparatively a low figure, because his pedigree is said 
 to be deficient, or, in other words, the names of his dam 
 or sire, grandam or grandsire, cannot be stated. Many 
 an uncouth and unsightly animal, in some points, brings 
 a high figure, say one thousand dollars, because his 
 pedigree is said to be perfect, or, in other words, the 
 names of all his ancestry on both sides runs so far back 
 as to make it useless to go farther. There is no inter- 
 ruption in it, or want of connection. 

Now we wish to impress the fact, that in this latter 
 instance the animal may be more worthless than in the 
 other. As an illustration, suppose a person in the pre- 
 sent day to be able to trace back clearly his descent for 
 one hundred and fifty years, from a man who was swung 
 off from the scaffold. The pedigree, although perfect, is 
 a bad one ; and so with animals. The simple fact of the 
 names of all a cow's ancestors being recollected, or even 
 registered in the Herd Book, is not of itself sufficient 
 evidence of her being valuable. We do not care for 
 names, but things. The more and the longer pedigree a 
 cow or bull may have, the more undesirable they may 
 be, as it perhaps involves the possession of bad qualities, 
 which it is necessary to breed out, instead of crossing to 
 obtain. A great many very indifferent animals are re- 
 gistered in the English Herd Book, which no judge of 
 stock, anxious to improve his herd, would desire to own. 
 On the other hand take the case of the Duchess family 
 of Short-horns. Here is a family of Durhams, who, so 
 far as they can be traced back, have been remarkable 
 for their superiority in certain valuable points of form, 
 size, neatness, easy feeders, fine milkers, &c. A 
 Duchess cow of the present day not only can have her 
 pedigree traced back in respect to names, but these 
 names represent animals which are known to have been 
 very superior ; and on the pi-inciple that like produces 
 like, the probabilities are that those qualities will be in- 
 herited by their descendants. This is the reason that 
 the Duchess, Princess, and some other families of Short- 
 horns, always command such extraordinary prices. 

We would say to beginners, desirous to improve their 
 stock, do not pay for merely high sounding names, un- 
 less you know what they represent, whether excellence 
 or the contrary. We would rather commence with a 
 good common cow (a deep milker), and cross her with a 
 well shaped bull, whose ancestors for two or three years 
 we knew something about, in order to accomplish a cer- 
 tain degree of improvement in a given time, than to 
 breed from animals with long pedigrees, of which we 
 knew nothing. 

No one estimates higher than ourselves the importance 
 of a good pedigree, but we wish it fully understood that 

it is not necessarily good because it is long. It may be 
 much the worse for being long, but it is not necessarily 
 on that account good. Imagine the case of a Durham 
 cow (thorough-bred), so called, with a light or deficient 
 hind quarter. She may, although a herd book animal, 
 have inherited that defect from an ancestor twenty-five 
 years ago, which has been carried down through suc- 
 cessive generations. We assert that it would be more 
 difficult to raise a calf from her having a heavy hind 
 quarter, than from a common cow who was defective in 
 that point, but only as an aecidental property or pecu- 
 liarity. We would encourage every farmer to keep a 
 book — a herd book of his own — in which to register the 
 names of all his permanent stock kept for breeding — 
 cows, sheep, pigs, &c. It will be found vastly conveni- 
 ent and useful, and enable him to cross his animals with 
 more judgmeut, and preserve more readily their desira- 
 ble characteristics. 

Liability of Nurserymen. 

J. L. Darlington, Esq:— Please give me through 
 the Farm Journal, your views as to whether or not re- 
 dress by law can be had from a nurseryman, by whom 
 I have been terribly imposed on with a lot of trees, 
 costing over two hundred dollars ; out of three hundred 
 and fifty trees, fruit and ornamental together, but twen- 
 ty-five are now alive. My neighbors tell me there is no 
 help for it, and that I had better keep quiet, but it has 
 been my rule through life not to submit to imposition, 
 and if there is any law in the land to meet the case, I 
 intend to incur the expense of testing the question for 
 my own and the public benefit. With the exception of 
 three or four bundles which had been badly rubbed in 
 the railroad cars, the trees were in apparently good or- 
 der. It must have been only apparently, as the result 
 proves they must have been badly grown and unhealthy 
 Being engaged at my usual business in the city, I left 
 the planting with my two Irishmen, charging them par- 
 ticularly to do it carefully, and they are willing to be 
 qualified every pains was taken, and that they had never 
 worked harder than during the two days they were en- 
 gaged at it. Wishing to neglect nothing, I have also 
 had them watered every evening for three weeks, du- 
 ring the dry weather, and after all my pains, expense, 
 and anxiety, the result is as stated. 

Now Mr. Editor, if I buy a barrel of apples warran- 
 ted sound and on opening find four-fifths are rotten, and 
 if I buy a piece of dry goods, silk, woolen or muslin, 
 and find on opening the bundle they are moth eaten, or 
 otherwise damaged, I have a right to return them and 
 get my money. This seems plain, common sense, 
 whether it is law or not. Please give us your opinion, 
 as I have reason to believe mine is not a solitary case. 

Philadelphia. A. HIBBART. 

In answer to our correspondent, we would reply that 
 if he has a needy relative who is a lawyer, and wanting 
 business, we would by all means recommend him to ap- 
 propriate five hundred dollars as a fee, in order to "test 
 the question" fully. It would not only be patriotic, but 
 an acceptable charity, as we know young lawyers com- 
 mencing business are very often in want of cases and 
 funds. We have no doubt the verdict of a jury for all 
 that appears in his statement above, would be for the
