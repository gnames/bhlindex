defendant, and plaintiff to pay the costs. It has often 
 appeared to us most singular, that the fault of an or- 
 chard not bearing, or dying out prematurely, should be 
 as a matter of course attributed to the nurseryman. He 
 is truly responsible only, for trees being thrifty and 
 healthy when they pass out of his hands, for their being 
 true to name, rightly directed, and -well packed. Beyond 
 these he has no control. He does not go with them to 
 see that they carry safely. He does not plant them, or 
 give them attention afterwards, and there is not even 
 '■'common sense," in his being held liable for the igno- 
 rance or carelessness of others. His duty is discharged 
 when they are placed on the car or boat. To plant trees 
 properly, to prune them judiciously, to give them as 
 much and no more water than they require, to mulch 
 the surface, to keep the bark healthy, pliable, and free 
 from moss, &c, are matters for the purchaser of trees 
 to study and attend to, and unless he does, it is folly to 
 plant them and expect either fine fruit or healthy foli- 
 age. Our friend Hibbart appears to have left the re- 
 sponsibility of what is always and necessarily an ope- 
 ration requiring the greatest skill and judgment, with 
 two Irishmen, and the style in which they performed it, 
 may be readily inferred from the fact that it occupied 
 only two days, whereas no two skilful and experienced 
 men, entirely acquainted both with the theory and prac- 
 tice of tree planting, could have planted three hundred 
 and fifty trees as they ought to be, in less than a week, 
 and not in that time without other help. 

Why three weeks drenching with water, would drown 
 the life out of any tree before its leaves were developed, 
 without any other cause to produce death. 

As they were "apparently" in good condition when 
 they arrived, the presumption is very clear that the nur- 
 seryman had done his part, and that the failure was 
 owing to other causes. 

Unless our friend has more money than he knows what 
 to do with, he had better take his neighbor's advice. 

The case stated about a piece of cloth, is not at all ap- 
 plicable. If when opened it was in good order and had be- 
 come moth eaten afterwards, he would hardly ask redress, 
 and this appears to have been the case with the trees.-ED.

Portraits and Plaster Casts. 
 We have received from Samuel Thorn, Esq., of Thorn- 
 dale, Duchess county, N. Y., a pair of beautiful por- 
 traits, of his Short Horn Bull Grand Duke 10,284, and 
 Short Horn Cow Duchess 64, bred by the late Thomas 
 Bates, of Kinkleavington, England, and imported by 
 Jonathan Thome, father of the present owner. Grand 
 Duke cost in England one thousand guineas, and Duch- 
 ess six hundred guineas. Too much credit cannot be 
 given to the enterprise that thus, regardless of cost, 
 procured the best stock in England. We have also re- 
 ceived from the same gentleman, plaster casts of a cou- 
 ple of his Southdown Sheep, which are beautifully exe- 
 cuted, more so than anything we have seen of the kind 
 in this country. Their fine proportions and perfection 
 in the most valuable points of the carcass, make them 
 fit subjects for study, and they would be valuable for 
 any farmer, engaged in breeding sheep, to keep such 
 models before him, as a standard for comparison with 
 his own flock. 

Catawissa Raspberry. 

The Catawissa raspberry originated in the grave- 
 yard of a little Quaker meeting house in the village of 
 Catawissa, Columbia county, Penna. The fruit is of medi 
 um size, inferior to many of the new popular varieties, 
 but is sufficiently large for all economical purposes. Its 
 color is dark red purple when ripe, and is of a very high 
 flavor. It bears most abundantly after the young wood, 
 on which it produces its best fruit, attains a height of 
 four or five feet; usually begins to- ripen early in August, 
 and even sooner. The fruit is produced on branches 
 continually pushing out from all parts, successively ap- 
 pearing in various stages of growth, from the blossom to 
 perfect maturity; and often there may be counted more 
 than fifty berries on a branch. As the fruit of each 
 branch successively ripens, the later ones gradually di- 
 minish in size ; but there is no suspension of blooming or 
 fruiting, before the plant is checked by frost. If protec- 
 ted in doors, it undoubtedly would produce during the 
 winter months. One great advantage of this over other 
 varieties of the raspberry is, that if the stocks should be 
 accidentally broken or cut off, or should be killed by 
 winter frost, it is all the better for the crop. Another 
 advantage is, that from the small space of a few yards 
 well cultivated, a daily dessert for a small family would 
 always be at hand for from three to four months of the year.

The Jujube Tree. 

The seeds of this tree were imported a short time sinca 
 from the south of Europe for experiment in the South. 
 It grows in the form of a shrub of middle size, bearing a 
 red oval fruit about as large as olives, inclosing a stone 
 of the same shape. They are sweet, but only eaten 
 among us in the form of paste. In Algiers the fruit 
 ripens in the month of June, and is much sought after 
 by the inhabitants, who consume large quantities, both 
 fresh and dried, as well as in the form of a delicious paste.

Cuttings of the Zante Currants 
 There has been introduced from France the cuttings of 
 the Zante currant — a variety of small grape — which have 
 been distributed in the Middle aud Western States. This 
 variety of fruit, so well known as entering into the com- 
 position of some parts of domestic cookery, should it 
 succeed, will add to the numerous varieties of choice 
 fruit which have been introduced within the last few 
 years into this country. lb.
