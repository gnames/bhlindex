Memories. 

BY J. G. WHTITIER. 

A beautiful and happy girl, 

With step as soft as summer air, 
 And fresh young lip and brow of pearl, 
 Shadowed by many a careless curl 
 Of unconfined and flowing hair, 

A seeming child in everything; 
 Save thoughtful brow and ripening charms, 

As nature wears the smile of spring, 
 When sinking into summer's arms. 
 Years have passed on, and left their trace, 

Of graver care and deeper thought, 
 And unto me the calm cold face 
 Of manhood, and to thee the grace 
 Of woman's pensive beauty brought. 
 Of Life's rough blast to blame or praise 

The school boy's name has widely flown; 
 Thine in the green and quiot ways 

Of unobtrusive goodness known. 
 And wider yet in thought and deed 

Our still diverging paths incline; 
 Thine the Genevan's sternest creed, 
 While answers to the spirit's need 

The Yorkshire peasant's simple line; 
 For thee the priestly-rite and prayer, 

And holy-day and solemn psalm; 
 For me the silent reverence where 

My brethern gather slow and calm. 
 Yet hath thy spirit left on me 

An impress time hath worn not out, 
 A something of myself in thee, 
 A shadow from the past I see, 

Lingering even yet thy way about, 
 Not wholly can the heart unlearn 

That lesson of the better hours ; 
 Not yet has time's dull foot-steps worn 

To common dust that path of flowers. 
 Thus while at times before the eye 

The clouds about the present part, 
 And smiling through them, round us lie 
 Soft hues of Memory's morning sky ; 

The Indian summer of the heart, 
 In secret sympathies of mind, 

In founts of feeling which retain 
 Their pure fresh flow, we yet may find 

Our early dreams not wholly vain. 
 -A mind rejoicing in the light 

Which melted through its graceful bowers, 
 Leaf after leaf serenely bright 

And stainless in its holy white 

Unfolding like the morning flower ; 
 A heart, which, like a fine toned flute 

With every breath of feeling woke, 
 And even when the tongue was mute, 

From eye and lip in music spoke. 
 How thrills once more the lengthening chain 

Of memory at the thought of thee ! 
 Old hopes which long in dust have lain, 
 Old dreams come thronging back again, 

And boy hood lives again in me ; 
 I feel its glow upon my cheek, 

Its fulness of the heart is mine, 
 As when I leaned to hear the speak, 

Or raised my doubtful eyes to thine. 
 I hear again thy low replies, 

I feel thine arm within my own, 
 And timidly again upraise 

The fringed-lids of hazel eyes 
 With soft brown tresses overblown ; 

Ah, memories of sweet summer eves, 
 Of moonlit wave and willowy way, 

Of stars and flowers and dewy leaves, 

And smiles and tones more dear than they. 
 Ere this thy quiet eye hath smiled, 

My picture of thy youth to see, 
 When half a woman, half a child, 
 Thy very artlessness beguiled, 

And folly's self seemed wise in thee, 
 I too can smile, when o'er that hour 

The lights of memory backward stream, 
 Yet feel the while that manhood's power 

Is vainer than my boyhood's dream. 

Cost of Raising Wheat, Corn, &c. 

The next volume of the N. Y. Agricultural Transactions, 
 will contain a detailed farm account of Mr. Wm. Johnson, 
 nearGeneva, from which we gather the following interesting 
 items in regard to the cost of raising different crops the last 
 season. His statement is published in the Journal of the 
 State Society, for the present month, and shows very cred- 
 itably the order and method of Mr. J.'s agricultural opera- 
 tions. 

The farm contains 80 acres of tillable land divided into 
 nine lots, numbered from one upwards, and accurate account 
 kept with each. The soil is a dry loam, with a clay subsoil, 
 pretty uniform throughout the farm. Each crop is charged 
 with the interest on the value of the land producing it, and 
 with all the labor and material used in its production. Of 
 wheat six acres were sown, the whole expense was $122,40; 
 the product was 126 bushels or 21 bushels per acre; this makes 
 its cost per bushel a trifle over 97 cents. But deducting the 
 value of the straw, estimated at $18, we make the cost of the 
 wheat but 83 cts. per bushel. It was sold at $1,81, leaving 
 a fair margin for profit at either figures. But at the price of 
 wheat for many years past the profit would have been little 
 or nothing. 

Eight acres of Barley cost $102,20 and produced 284 bush- 
 els, or 35J bushels per acre. It cost nearly 37 cts., and sold 
 for $1,00 per bushel. This produced a greater per cent, of 
 profit than the wheat, as we believe it generally has, for a 
 series of years. 

Ten acres of corn on clover sod cost $153,26. The product 
 was 410 bushels of corn and $60 worth of corn stalks. Mr. 
 Johnson states the cost of raising the corn at 37Â£ cts. per 
 bushel, but if we deduct the value of the stalks from the 
 whole expense it makes the cost of the corn but 22J cts. per 
 bushel. We should be glad of some explanation from Mr. 
 J. on this point, as the value of the stalks aud straw may 
 have been allowed to balance some part of the expenses not 
 indicated. 

Ten cows are kept upon the farm, yielding an average of 210 
 lbs. of butter each. Mr. J. estimates the product of each cow 
 worth about $54, and the cost of keeping $26,85. It cost 
 12J cts. per lb. to mafe butter, on Elmwood farm, and we 
 think it cannot be sold for less anywhere with much profit. 
 His pork killed at 9i months old, fed on milk and fattened 
 with corn, costs 5 cts. per pound. The balance over ex- 
 penses on the whole farm, for last year was $953,42. 

Mr. Johnson practices the following system of rotation. 
 1st corn, to which is applied all the unfermented manure he 
 can get. The next spring it is sown with barley at the rate 
 of 2J bushels of seed to the acre, then sown to wheat in the
