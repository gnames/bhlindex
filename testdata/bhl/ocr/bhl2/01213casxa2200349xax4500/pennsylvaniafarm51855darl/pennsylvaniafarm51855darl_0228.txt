fall, with a top dressing of fino mauuro, of about 6 loads to 
 the acre. The following spring it is sown with 8 quarts of 
 clover seed and 4 quarts of Timothy, with one bushel of 
 plaster per acre, when it is allowed to remain three years in 
 grass. The usual product is 55 bushels of corn, 30 of barley, 
 and from 20 to 30 of wheat, per acre. The manure is all kept 
 under cover and a regular system of underdraining is being 
 carried out. We should be glad to receive further particulars 
 of the latter, for the benefit of our readers. — Rural New

 Rape. 

Your correspondents N. L. and F. A. N. differ in opinion 
 on the subject of rape. Having practised agriculture in 
 countries where this plant is extensively cultivated, my 
 views on the subject, in accordance with those of the best 
 practical agriculturists of Continental Europe, may perhaps 
 not be without any interest for your readers. 

Rape is cultivated in England for early pasture, but less 
 and less. Its cultivation for the purpose of oil making 
 would not pay as it is no sure crop, and the prices of bread- 
 stuffs and animal produce are always high. All rape cake 
 that is fed or employed as manure is there imported. 

Rape is extensively grown in all the most fertile districts 
 of North Western Continental Europe. Its cultivation can 
 be of advantage only on fertile, not too clayey, freshly ma- 
 nured lands, with well draining or well drained underground, 
 and on farms with an abundance of manure, on other places 
 it is at the utmost, of temporary profit and soon exhausting. 

Rape requires a careful, deep culture, which has to begin 
 in spring so as to give the sward time to rot between the 
 repeated plowings. 

Rape requires only little covering. The sowing is done 
 in August in countries where winter sets in earlier than here 
 and where the fall months are less hot but generally bring 
 much more rain. The seed is sown broadcast, or what is 
 much better, and now done almost exclusively drilled in. 
 The drills are from eighteen to twenty-four inches apart. 
 The quantity of seed required on an acre when sown in 
 drills is from seven to ten lbs. I perceive that N. L. sowed 
 his rape and then planted out. In Europe it is immediately 
 sown over the whole field and not transplanted. Such a 
 process would be more expensive, and make the crop less 
 sure, because these transplanted seedlings often die in dry, 
 and are more tender in wet or cold weather. When rape is 
 put in drills, earth is brought up to the plants once or twice 
 in the fall with the double mouldboard plough, and once 
 early in the spring, provided the ground is sufficiently dry. 

Winter rape is an uncertain crop, it suffers from winter 
 wet and open frost, (there is generally more snow and a 
 dryer .and intenser cold in the north of Continental Eu- 
 rope, than in Pennsylvania,) from the flea, caterpillars and 
 scarabees, which last ones, getting into the blossoms, of- 
 ten destroy the mos f promising crop. (F. A. N. will not al- 
 ways find these enemies driven into the sea, and perchance 
 experience that certain insects generate in larger quanti- 
 ties by the more extended cultivation of certain plants.) If 
 we well cultivate and manure rape 9n appropriate ground, 
 we assume from five crops three complete ones. Harvesting 
 takes place in the beginning of July, (in Pennsylvania it 
 would probably in the middle of June). The pods when dry 
 burst easily and the grain is lost, therefore one prefers to take 
 in the rape not too dry and thresh it immediately, because 
 standard grain suffers by the development of heat in the barn 
 in many places one brings it even on large cloths spread in 
 the field, and threshes it there. Rape will sometimes give 
 thirty-six bushels to the acre, I have seen forty-five, but 

often crops will fail entirely, so that on good soil, with good 
 culture, the average result from an acre, cannot be calculated 
 more than twenty-four bushels to the acre, whereby one has 
 to consider that it gives less to the barnyard than surer 
 crops. 

Rape certainly can be cultivated hero notwithstanding it 
 will be a still less sure crop than in North Western Europe as 
 the weather is rather too dry in the fall, more wot and change- 
 able, in winter with more open frost here than there. The 
 cultivator would be paid worst just as in Europe, near the 
 large (Eastern) markets, where animal produce is very high 
 priced, often higher than in Loudon ; it would pay best in 
 tho fertile lands of the west provided one can work the soil 
 sufficiently and get hands enough for harvesting. In the 
 west too, the manufactured oil will sooner bear the competi- 
 tion of imported animal and vegetable oils, and the cake will 
 find a remunerating sale ; it will be unprofitable when the 
 prices of grain are very high, as now, but bring ready money 
 in the hands of western farmers when srrain is low. 0. R. 

■ How to Destroy the Onion Fly. 

Mr. Editor: — I notice, in the last number of the. Farmer, 
 your desire of information in regard to the destruction of 
 ,the onion fly or a remedy against its ravages. If your "old 
 friend," and others that may have been pestered with its 
 presence, will follow the course pursued by me for the last 
 throe years, with satisfactory success, they may again pride 
 themselves upon having a good kitchen garden. 

I sow in trenches, with a good supply of seed soaked in 
 warm water, (stirring in plaster to dry the seed, also making 
 it far better for sowing.) As soon as I see the first wither, 
 from the maggot working at the root of the plant, I heat 
 water in proportion to the size of the bed, throwing in while 
 boiling a quantity of tansy. While hot, pour the liquid from 
 a sprinkler (without the rose) or a large coffee pot around 
 the roots, but care should be taken not to pour it on the 
 stock. I think clear water may answer the purpose. The 
 maggot being tender is easily killed by the heat. 

I have gathered large sized onions with a hole between 
 the roots (caused by the tormentor while small) as large as a 
 filbert, which were saved by one application only of the 
 above remedy. — G. E. G. Maine Farmer.

Influences of the Moon on Agriculture. 

Mr. Editor : — In your last April No. of the Farm Jour- 
 nal, a gentleman subscribing his name "A. W. C, gives 
 some experience he has had concerning the influence of the 
 Moon on certain objects. I have gone some farther than he 
 in making experiments, and watching what effect the moon 
 might have on objects. I have been farming for myself 
 forty-seven years and have watched the signs of the moon 
 fully, to satisfy myself. In the first place, what influenoe 
 has the moon on cutting timber? about forty years ago one 
 of our neighbors put up two or three hundred panels of post 
 fence; twenty years after the fence was good; there was 
 great inquiring when the timber was cut; it was said to be 
 cut in the dark of the February moon. I cut posts and rails 
 in that sign, put up my fence, and in eight years it was 
 rotten. The sons of the man (who put up the above men- 
 tioned fence) say, it could not have been in February the 
 timber was cut, for they remember playing in the woods 
 Making bark whistles while their father was cutting it; they 
 say it was in May. I know by experience that timber cut 
 in May will last twice as long as that cut in February, with- 
 out respect to the moon ; the reason for this is, that in May 
 the sap flows up out of the wood and gathers under the bark
