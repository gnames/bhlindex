at the time. Where I spread the first load of manure hauled 
 in the fall, I usually have the best corn the ensuing season. 
 My reasons for this course are the following. By hauling 
 out manure in the fall, winter and spring, I get into my 
 fields all, that is at all suitable for this purpose. In this 
 way, the decomposition it must undergo in the barn yard, 
 takes place in the field, and imparts thereby nourishment 
 and strength to the growing crop. A field manured in the 
 way referred to, last year, produced seventy-five bushels of 
 good sound corn to the acre ; while a field of the same size 
 and soil of like quality, without manure, produced but forty- 
 five bushels per acre. Practical experience is preferable to 
 theory. But to return to my statement. The manure once 
 out of my barn-yard, I immediately commence littering up, 
 •with every available material, to act as an absorbent of the 
 juices of the yard; and I find, that by the time oat-harvest 
 is over, I still have sufficient to cover over a thirty-acre field 
 for wheat. Had all remained in the yard until after harvest, 
 no one, that has not tested the matter practically, would be- 
 lieve the reduction the bulk of manure would undergo. I 
 have now, at the writing of this article, hauled out manure 
 sufficient for forty acres of corn and potatoes; and I expect, 
 after oat-harvest, to have made sufficient to cover over thirty 
 acres for wheat. 

When I plow for oats in the spring the field manured the 
 year previous for corn, I usually sow it with clover seed. 
 The mellow and friable condition of the soil, from the effects 
 of the manure, renders the chance for a crop of clover almost 
 certain. This field, the following year, I pasture to some 
 extent, and then make open fallow of it for wheat, without 
 any further manuring, excepting possibly upon a dry knoll 
 or two. 

I have now a twenty acre field of wheat, seeded the 7th 
 day of last September, in this way, without manure, that 
 "will vie with any field I have yet seen this season. The 
 manure was hauled upon a thirty acre field, which had been 
 in oats, and seeded with wheat on the 11th and 13th of Sep- 
 tember ; but this does not look near as well as the field first 
 referred to. I believe a good clover sod, without manure, 
 usually a better chance for wheat, than oats stubble manured 
 in the usual way. 

I place but little reliance upon the analysis of soils, so 
 much talked and written about in these days of wonderful 
 improvement. Take, for instance, the farm upon which I 
 reside. I do not believe that any ten rods will bear a like 
 classification of soil. Hence then the difficulty of ascertain- 
 ing the component parts, and of applying artificial manures 
 with certainty. This being the case, I rely mainly upon 
 lime and barn -yard manure to keep up my farm. I have 
 used artificial manures, but only to a limited extent; and I 
 cannot say, in any case, with much advantage. I know 
 that many farmers say they derive great benefit from the 
 use of guano ; and I have no doubt, token the season suits, 
 and they get a pure article, this is the case, particularly on 
 worn out lands. But how many are there who will tell you, 
 that they have tried all without any apparent advantage. 
 This may be owing, in part, to the uncertainity of what a 
 man gets when he buys guano ; and until there is some sure 
 method adopted to protect the farmer in the purchase of this, 
 no doubt, valuable article, and the many nostrums of the 
 day manufactured to get his money, I for one, for the pres- 
 ent, prefer to stick to the old plan of lime and barn-yard 
 manure. In this method there is no doubt or uncertainty. 
 The farmer is sure of a beneficial result. 

Admitting guano to be highly beneficial, will it pay at its 
 present high prices? With a judicious use of all the mate- 
 rial about a farm for the creating of manure and the preser- 
 vation of that already made, any farm of an ordinarily good 

soil, can be kept in a fine state of improvement, with but 
 little outlay for manure, and gradually made to increase in 
 value. 

With these few plain remarks, hastily thrown together, I 
 leave the subject, with the hope that some of our more able 
 and enterprising farmers will take up their pens and com- 
 municate their views in like manner.

Lime Spreaders Again. 

Mr. Darlington: — Sir: — In your Farm Journal I see 
 one of your correspondents complains much about his Mow- 
 ing Machine and Lime Spreader, Ac, &c. I have one of 
 Cooper's Lime Spreaders, and have spread six thousand 
 bushels of lime on about one hundred and fifty acres of land: 
 two thousand five hundred last spring, and three thousand 
 five hundred this spring. I put two hands with it and they 
 spread on the average, about seven or eight acres a day; 
 some days they would spread ten acres, owing to distance 
 they had to haul the lime. The lime was in good order 
 mostly, as I don't wish to put it on my land in any other 
 way, not wishing to lose its virtue; which I believe ,-would 
 be greatly the case if spread in a wet condition, no ■matter 
 with what kind of machine or implement applied. An old 
 maxim is that "whatever is worth doing at all is worth 
 doing well"; therefore, if liming is of use it is fair to do it 
 in right order; which certainly can be done with the Lime 
 Spreader I got of Mr. Cooper, if the lime is in any kind of 
 good order. I would not willingly spare my machine for 
 four times its cost, which was (including expense of trans- 
 portation eighty eight dollars and thirty three cents, the 
 freight being eight dollars and thirty three cents. I think 
 the machine is worthy of a good name, and the inventor 
 worthy of patronage for making such a machine. I offer 
 this gratuitous mite on his behalf hoping that you will give 
 it space in your columns without the hope of a "Silver Plow" 
 being awarded to me for endeavoring to set the Farmers 
 right with Lime Spreaders. Truly yours,

Chester County Horticultural and Industrial Exhibition. 

The June semi-annual display of this Society, came off 
 on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd ult., at West Chester; and taking 
 all things together may be considered the most successful of 
 any yet held. 

We understand on the last day and evening, over two 
 thousand and three hundred tickets were sold ; showing a 
 continued interest on the part of the people of the county, 
 in getting up and sustaining these Exhibitions. The dis- 
 play embraced as usual, not only fruits, flowers and vegeta- 
 bles, but also specimens of mechanical skill and ingenuity, 
 fine arts, <fcc, highly creditable to the county. Roses, of 
 some sixty varieties, Green-house plants, many of the rare 
 and beautiful specimens, Evergreen trees and shrubs, <fcc, 
 were contributed by the nurserymen. Cherries and Straw- 
 berries of fine quality and great variety also of them, and 
 other fruit growers; vegetables in profusion, many of then 
 of extraordinary size, by the market and amateur growers; 
 and also by various residents of the Borough and county, 
 elegant furniture, paintings, ornamental baskets, worsted 
 work, and embroidery, ottoman covers, dageurreotypes, pre- 
 serves, <fcc. 

Out of Philadelphia, and perhaps Alleghany, there is no 
 county in the State, but Chester, which sustains Agricultural 
 and Horticultural societies in separate organizations. Here 
 they are both working distinct, and yet harmoniously, and 
 both flourish. The Horticultural society has built for itself
