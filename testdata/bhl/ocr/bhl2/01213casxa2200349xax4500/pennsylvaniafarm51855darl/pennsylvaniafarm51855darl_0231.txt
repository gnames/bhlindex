a spacious Hall costing over six thousand dollars, now nearly 
 paid for; and holds in addition to its regular monthly meet- 
 ings and Exhibitions, two semi-annual exhibitions like the 
 present, which have always been crowded, and there is no 
 doubt will continue to flourish. Its finances will very shortly 
 be in such a condition as to be able to enlarge its premium 
 lists, so as to make them really what premiums ought in all 

cases to be, objects of remuneration to contributors, for ex- 
 cellence or superiority in their contributions. When this 
 is attained it gives a ground-work or nucleus for extended 
 usefulness, and places any society on a vantage ground, 
 where its influence will be more powerfully seen and felt. 
 We are glad that the Agricultural and Horticultural Socie- 
 ties of Chester county will soon be in this enviable position.
