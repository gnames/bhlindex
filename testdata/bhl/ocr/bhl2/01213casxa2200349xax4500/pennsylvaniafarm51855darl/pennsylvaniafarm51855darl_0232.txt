[July- 

Pittsburgh Horticultural Exhibition. 

Mr. Editor: — I herewith send you the reports of the 
 awarding Committees at the June Exhibition of the Pitts- 
 burgh Horticultural Society just closed ; from which you 
 will see that the good cause is making great progress in this 
 transmoutane region. We had a fine display of flowers and 
 early fruits ; and every thing passed off satisfactorily to the 
 Society, because the Exhibitors were many, and showed by 
 their fruits that they had been provoking one another to 
 good works in the cultivation of the soil ; and to the public 
 at large, because for three days it spread before their eyes a 
 spectacle of rare plants, choice fruits and vegetables; and 
 satisfied them, that in the production of the kindly fruits of 
 the earth, our own county has advanced pari passu, with 
 other garden spots in our land. This is apparent from the 
 enclosed reports. 

The display of Cacti, Fuchsias Tind Verbenas, was exten- 
 sive and beautiful, — but in the Floral department, the great 
 attraction was the "Night Blooming Ceres" from the Con- 
 servatory of C. F. Spang, Esq. This magnificent plant had 
 thirteen buds well developed, three -of which were expected 
 to bloom on the second night of the Exhibition; but owing 
 to a sudden and great change in the weather on the day of 
 its removal to the Hall, it had become chilled, and the ex- 
 pansion of the buds was checked, to the great disappoint- 
 ment of a crowd of visitors; on the last day however, Mr. 
 Spang kindly sent another plant from his valuable collection, 
 which did bloom in the perfection of beauty; while on the 
 same night, the first one having partially recovered from its 
 chilling reception, and as if not to be outdone by its rival, 
 partially expanded three of its flowers, so that we enjoyed 
 a rare treat. 

There was also a choice collection of Foreign Grapes 
 from the Grapery of Mr. Spang ; large, beautiful and well 
 ripened, comprising the ''Black Hamburg, White Cheasselas, 
 Red do, White Frontignac, West St. Peters, and Charge 
 Henling." 

Next after the above, perhaps the Strawberries attracted 
 most attention and admiration; especially from the many 
 strangers who visited the Hall, and I think I may say with- 
 out presumption or boasting, that Alleghany county, Penn., 
 can challenge the world on the Strawberry question. Such, 
 at least, seemed to be the .testimony of persons from differ- 
 ent parts of the U. S. The chief varieties on exhibition, 
 were Hovey's, Buist's Prize, Boston Prize, Victoria (Keen's 
 Seedling), M'Avoy's Superior, Princess Alicemaude, and 
 Wyatts British Queen. Most of these berries measured in 
 circumference over four inches, very many over five, many 
 over six, and some seven inches; of these, perhaps the 
 greatest favorite for the table at present is the M'Avoy, 
 being large, sweet, and productive. It is objected to it, as a 
 market berry, that it is soft, and therefore becomes crushed 
 in transportation; for the same reason it is not a very desi- 
 rable berry for preserving, for which purpose the Hovey's 
 and Buist's have been the favorites. Buist's New Prize, is 
 coming into favor with many of our growers and is highly 
 esteemed. Wyatt's British Queen promises to be one of, if 
 not, the finest of all our berries, being handsome, firm, lus- 
 cious, and a good bearer. It has but recently been intro- 
 duced here, but so far as my observation goes, I would call it 
 No. 1. 

The collection of Cherries was very attractive, and drew 
 a crowd of admirers. It comprised the following varieties 
 — Early Purple Guigue, Elton, Black Tartarean, Knight's 
 Early Black, May Duke, Gov. Wood, Napoleon and Flesh 
 colored Bigarreau. 

Mr. Howett's eleven varieties of Cucumbers, astonished 
 the uninitiated, by their size and appearance, as well as 

their weight; the smallest being eleven inches long, and 
 weighing one pound, while the largest measured eighteen 
 inches and weighed two pounds seven ounces ; they embraced 
 all the intermediate sizes, and the following, among other 
 varieties, White Spine, Black do., Jeness, Lion House, Man 
 of Kent, Manchester' Prize, Lord Kenyon, Emperor, &c, &c. 

There were also exibited thirty three varieties ef Goose- 
 berries, though it was too early to see them in perfection. 

We hope to have another Exhibition in September next, 
 when we would be glad to see our distant Horticultural 
 friends, whether as competitors or spectators. Your obedi- 
 ent servant. ROBERT M'KNIGHT.

Pittsburgh, June 20th, 1855. 

We are under obligations to our friend, the President of 
 the Pittsburgh Horticultural Society, for the above interest- 
 ing account of their Exhibition. We regret being unable 
 to publish the award of Premiums, of any one mere local 
 exhibition, as it would entail upon us the necessity of pub- 
 lishing for all the counties in the State and occupy too much 
 of the space of the Farm Journal. 

We shall be much pleased however, to receive condensed 
 notices, like the above of all of them. — Ed. 

Pruning, 

I have lately noticed some of my neighbors, with jack- 
 knife, handsaw, and hatchet in hand, attacking their fruit 
 trees as though they were enemies whom it was their pur- 
 pose to wound and mutilate and disable by all means in 
 their power. After the battle has been fought I have seen 
 the ground covered with branches, and in some cases with 
 heads and trunks lying scattered in all directions around the 
 scathed and bleeding trees, that remain like wounded and 
 maimed soldiers, after a hard fought conflict. And the tro- 
 phies of the victory thus obtained are carried off by the 
 whole cart loads in the shape of sound, healthy sprouts and 
 branches, covered with leaf and fruit-bud, and consigned to 
 the wood-pile. 

It seems to me, sir, that these good neighbors of mine are 
 trying an experiment to see how much injury they can in- 
 flict upon their trees, without destroying their lives. When 
 the Inquisitors stretch a heretic upon the rack, they place a 
 surgeon by his side, with his finger upon the pulse, to decide 
 when the torture has been carried to the limits of human en- 
 durance. But not so with our tree-trimmers. They seem to 
 think that there is no limit to the endurance of vegetable life. 
 This subject has often been referred to in your paper, aDd 
 the evil consequences of such a course have been frequently 
 pointed out. But the fact that this practice still continues, 
 shows that not enough has yet been said. "Line upon 
 line and precept upon precept," seems to be the only way in 
 which truth can be fixed in the public mind. If those who 
 pursue this course will watch their trees carefully, and observe 
 the effects of their treatment for two or three years, I think 
 they will be satisfied that it is not only useless, but highly 
 injurious. When the trees are trimmed in March, April and 
 May, as soon as the warm weather comes on, and the sap 
 presses into and distend the sap vessels, and runs down 
 and blackens and poisons the bark, and causes it to crack and 
 separate from the underlying alburnum, and thus effectually 
 prevent the healing of the wound, gangrene and death of 
 a portion of the wood neceesarily follow. Where several 
 such wounds are made in a tree, its whole constitution will 
 soon become impaired. It ceases to grow, and in a few 
 years droops and dies. 

Trees that are trimmed the least will generally be found 
 to be the most vigorous, and to develope the best formed and 
 most beautiful heads. Now and then, a limb that is putting
