Rambouillet, he replied he was without experience as a 
 manufacturer, as from what he had examined on the back 
 of the sheep, and from the amount of dirt and grease which 
 always appeared connected with or added to them, he had 
 never the least desire to purchase their wool, neither does 
 he like to manufacture the old fashioned Merino wool, on 
 account of the natural grease it contains. This calculation is 
 based upon flocks ordinarily cared for in large numbers ; of 
 course where small flocks are well kept and well cared for, the 
 average weight of wool will be greatly increased. My cal- 
 culations and statements are made for those who may wish 
 to embark in sheep farming on a large scale. 

Having fixed the value of the wool certainly equal per 
 head, let us now proceed to the value of the carcase. As to 
 the quality of mutton, contrasted with other sheep, it is a 
 fact as well established that Southdown mutton is as far su- 
 perior to any other in this country, as a canvass back duck 
 is to all others of its kind. In the Highlands of Scotland 
 and in Wales there is a little mountain breed of sheep that 
 equal if not surpass the Southdowns in quality of mutton, 
 but it is mainly owing to the herbage upon which they feed. 
 I was so struck with the quality of that mutton in 1850, while 
 in the Highlands near the Trossacks, that I determined to 
 purchase some of the sheep and forward them to Liverpool 
 to be shipped with a lot of animals I sent home that year. I 
 was recommended to a Mr. MacGregor as the best person to 
 got them from ; after quite a toilsome journey, and making 
 my wishes known, MacGregor said he would let me have 
 them with pleasure, and the main outlay would be the expense 
 of getting them to Liverpool, as the sheep themselves were of 
 but little value ; and upon informing him that I wanted them 
 for mutton sheep in America upon cultivated farms, where 
 they would be cared for as domestic animals should be, he 
 said, — "You had better take the Southdowns, for they pos- 
 ses all the advantage as to mutton when fed on the same 
 food, and will produce a great deal more of it." This wound 
 up my desire for the Black-faced Heath Sheep, and rather 
 increased my appetite for the mutton in its native location. 

The value of Southdown mutton is regularly established 
 by a certain additional price per pound in all the markets in 
 England, and in all cases the sheep's head and legs are left 
 on to satisfy the purchaser. The average size and weight of 
 Southdowns in large flocks would be greater than either of 
 the kinds with which I contrasted the value of their wool, 
 and their hardy constitutions, and being very prolific, often 
 producing twins, uncommonly good milkers and kind nurses 
 all tend to make them in my judgement the most valuable 
 sheep to propagate in the United States. The long- wooled, 
 such as the Bakewell, Leicester and Cotswold, I have not 
 taken in this calculation, as the quality of wool and mutton 
 vary so much from the Southdown that a comparison could 
 not well be made, and they are not sheep calculated for 
 keeping in large flocks. 

The result of sheep husbandry in England has driven the' 
 fine wooled sheep nearly, if not entirely out of the country, 
 and as it is the closest calculating agricultural country for 
 profit, it is fair to assume that my conclusions are correct. 
 At the present day, when meat bears so high a price as con- 
 trasted with wool, there is no question as to the superiority 
 of the Southdowns. 

Horses. 

The very worst recommendation a breeding horse can pos- 
 sibly have, is. that he possesses great height. If the horse 
 had been made like the "Crane, for wading in search of food, 
 or could be made useful to man for hunting ducks, or as a 
 fruit ladder, then it might be well to breed a few for these 
 objects. But, inasmuch as, for all the uses to which we put 

the animal, long legs, are a serious disadvantage, rendering 
 him liable to cripple up, at an early age, (who ever saw a 
 "leggy" horse, fit for the road at fifteen or twenty,) and 
 being invariably coupled with other serious imperfections, it 
 is of the utmost importance, that we steer clear of all animals 
 for breeding purposes, both male and female, that show too 
 much "daylight. The proper horse for the farmer is one of 
 enduring constitution, round in the body and thick set, quick, 
 but not fiery good sized joints, but not large boned, broad in 
 the hips, deep in the quarter, strong in the loins, capacious 
 in the chest, low upon the legs and having a good hoof. 
 Such a horse will be hardy, strong, and a good traveller, 
 and always up to the collar and the feed box. — Ohio Farmer.

Sheep Raising in Spain — Mode of giving Salt to the 
 Sheep: — The first thing the shepherd does when his flock 
 returns from the South to their summer downs or pastures, 
 is to give them as much salt as they will eat. Every own- 
 er allows to each tribe of a thousand sheep twenty -five quin- 
 tals of salt. (2,500 pounds,) which they consume in about 
 five months. They eat none in their journeys, nor are they 
 allowed any in winter, for it is a prevailing opinion that it 
 produces abortion when given to ewes forward with young. 
 This has ever been the custom, and is thought to be the true 
 reason why the kings of Spain could never raise the price of 
 salt to the height it has maintained in most parts of France: 
 for it would tempt the shepherd to stint the sheep, which it 
 is believed, would weaken their constitutions and deteriori- 
 ate their wool, The shepherd places fifty or sixty flat stones 
 at the distance of five paces apart, strews salt upon each, 
 leads the sheep among them, and every one is allowed to eat 
 of it at pleasure. But when they are feeding on limestone 
 land, whether it be on the grass of the downs, or on the little 
 plants of the cornfields after harvest home, they oat no salt; 
 and if they meet with a spot of mixed formation, they are 
 said to partake of it in proportion as the soil is mingled 
 with clay. The shepherd, being aware that his sheep will 
 suffer if deprived of salt, leads them to a clayey soil, and in 
 a quarter of an hour 's feeding they march to the stone and 
 devour whatever they need. 

Caution in Allowing the Sheep to Imbibe Frost or 
 Snow :— One of the shepherd's chief cares is not to suffer his 
 sheep to imbibe, in the morning, the frozen dew or melted 
 frost, and never to approach a pond or stream after a shower 
 of hail ; for, if they should eat the dewy grass, or drink the 
 melted hail, the whole tribe it is believed, would become de- 
 pressed in spirits, lose their appetites, pine away and die, as 
 often has happened. Hail water is also so pernicious to 
 man, in that climate, that people have learned by experi- 
 ence, not to drink from a rivulet or stream until some time 
 after a violent storm of hail, 

The Shepherds: — The salary of the chief shepherd does 
 not exceed two hundred dollars a year and a horse ; that of 
 the first under shepherd of a tribe, ten dollars a year; the 
 second, seven dollars ; the third, five ; the fourth three ; and 
 the fifth a- boy, two dollars a year. The ration of each is 
 two pounds of bread a day, with the privilege of keeping a 
 few goats in the flock for their milk. They are also entitled 
 to the skins and carcasses of the culled sheep and lambs, and 
 each receives from the chief shepherd a " regalito" of three 
 fourths of a dollar in April and October, and these are all 
 the sweets that these poor wretches enjoy, with the exception 
 of about a month in a year, which each takes in his turn, to 
 visit his family and friends. They are exposed the rest of 
 the time to all the vicissitudes of the weather, and at night 
 have to lie in miserable huts formed of stakes, brambles', or 
 branches of trees, and often sleep as they term it, de abaxo
