A Word to the Boys. 

I wish to say a word to the boys of the good old Keystone 
 State, through your valuable Journal, if you ha.ve any readers 
 that will come under the- name of boys. I see in a late paper 
 that boys are getting very scarce and the Yankees are about 
 contriving a machine to remedy the evil, as young America 
 boys think they aro men before they have seen fourteen 
 Bummers. It is to these I wish to speak at least the farming 
 portion of them. 

As harvest is coming on it is customary among the farmers 
 to rig a scythe for every thing that is able to carry one. 
 Now boys I would say to you to claim a good tool, not par- 
 ticular about a new one, although they look dazzling to the 
 eye they are not alwas the best, (all is not gold that glitters). 
 A well tried tool if not too much worn, is much better for 
 you. But let them be light and well fastened, for when a 
 thing has to be tinkered at in the field, you are bound to do 
 but little good. Do not pull and sweat in trying to make a 
 hand as most boys do, but what you attempt to do, do well. 
 Mow clean and level, have the pointing in and out as low 
 as the middle of your swath. If j T ou are with men, listen 
 not to their flattering words, as very few like to mow, and 
 they will try to get you to do as much as they can, thus ex- 
 hausting your streugth, and racking your frame, while you 
 are too young for the task. 

Be not over anxious to persuade your fathers to let you 
 mow or cradle as they have experienced it before you, and 
 can better judge of your ability to perform such work. If 
 parents do justice to their children they would not encour- 
 age them to begin too young, for by the time you are in 
 reality men you will be complaining of pains and Rheuma- 
 tism &c, and your life will be a trouble. 

Preserve a healthy constitution by moderate labor, and 
 never let idleness creep in upon your mortal borders. But 
 push onward in the field of action, for the time is coming 
 when prominent Agriculturists will be called the great men. 
 as the Generals are called great now. Yes ! the swords will 
 be beaten into Mowing Machines, and the spears into Reap- 
 ers and we will have war no more. A word to the wise is 
 sufficient ONE OF THE BOHOYS.

Founder in Horses. 
 I send you a recipe for founder in horses, which I have 
 never seen in print. I have used and recommended it for 
 fifteen years, and so far as my experience goes, it is a sure 
 and speedy remedy. Take a table-spoonful of pulverized 
 alum, pull the horse's tongue out of his mouth as far as pos- 
 sible and throw the alum down his throat ; let go of his 
 tongue and hold up his head until he swallows ; in 6 hours 
 time (no matter how bad the founder) he will be fit for mod- 
 erate service. I have seen this remedy tested so often with 
 perfect success, that I would not make five dollars difference 
 in a horse foundered, (if done recently,) and one that was 
 not. — E. L. PERHAM. — Country Gentlnman. — Albany, Or-

Agricultural Division of the Patent Office. 
 Plant live on Grape Vines: — We make an extract from a 
 paper by Mr. Townsend Glover on the plant louse, to be 
 published in the forthcoming agricultural report: — The plant 
 louse (Aphis) is very destructive to young shoots and leaves 
 of grape vines, as they suck out the sap by means of a 
 piercer or trunk, and thus enfeeble the system of the plant, 
 the natural history of these insects is similar to that of the 
 cotton louse. Their natural enemies are also the same, as 
 they are destroyed by the lady bird, the lace-wing fly, and 
 syrphus. I must, however, remark that the minute ichneu- 
 mon fly which destroys the aphis or grape vines, differs essen- 

tially from that of the cotton louse, although its general form 
 and habits are the same. 

"When the vines are in small gardens the best remedy to 
 destroy this pest would be to syringe the plants thoroughly, 
 both on the upper and lower sides of the foliage, with a so- 
 lution of whale oil soap. Dusting the leaves with lime has 
 also been recommended, and in a green house these lice can 
 be destroyed by a thorough fumigation with the smoke of 

tobacco.

APPLE TREE BORER. 

We copy the following from the Maine Farmer, as applica- 
 cable to the season. Now is the time to ferret out the borer, 
 and save ones trees. In addition to the recommendation be- 
 low, our friend J. S. Keller, of Orwigsburg, recommends in 
 the last vol. of the Journal, as apreventitive, where trees have 
 not been attacked, procure a square box, one and a half or" 
 two feet high, sufficiently wide to last for several years, to 
 reach at least ono inch or more into the ground, around the 
 trunk of each tree, the box to be closed at the top with fine 
 grass &c, covered with a coat of lime mortar, and the tree 
 whitewashed up to the first limbs. 

The box may be opened, and left open till April or May, 
 for air and moisture if necessary. A writer in the Ohio 
 Farmer, also says the attacks of the borer, may be prevented, 
 1. by trying only sound trees. 2. After setting them out 
 apply to the trunk and lower branches with an old broom, 
 the following. To two quarts of soft soap add half a pound 
 of sulphnr, and dilute the mass until it is as thin as paint by 
 pouring in strong tobacco water. Make one application to 
 the trunk and lower branches, the middle of May, and an- 
 other the middle of June. 3. Before the weather becomes 
 very hot, protect the trees from the sun by a board, or wrap- 
 ping wisp of straw around the portions most exposed to the 
 heat. 4. Place a circle of ashes close' around the root of the 
 tree. 

"The only sure way to kill the borer when he has got in 
 and began to work, (which may be known by seeing its sate 
 dust at the root of the tree,) is to find the hole where he 
 pushes out his shavings, and cut him out and cJiop his head 
 off. By pushing a limber wire up you may sometimes pierce 
 him, and kill him, but are not always sure of reaching him. 
 The time of the operation of this pest, is from June to 
 August. 

The preventatives recommended, are washing the tree 
 with potash water, soap suds, white-washing, &c, &e. 

The grass and sprouts and other incumbrances should be 
 cleared away from the trunk of the tree at its base, so that 
 there should be no hiding place for the winged insects to 
 lodgo in during the day. This species generally deposits its 
 eggs near the ground ; but there is another variety that at- 
 tacks the limbs. We once had a young tree killed by this 
 variety. The worm appeared smaller and flatter than the 
 one above described. Its parent we have never seen. 
 One of the most insidious and at the same time destructive 
 enemies to the apple tree in Maine is the borer, (Saperda 
 Bivittati, of naturalists. This is an insect of the beetle, or 
 as we Yankees say of the "bug" kind, which is represented in 
 the accompanying cut. In the perfect or winged state, as 
 you here see him, he is about an inch long, of a lightish brown 
 color with two white stripes running lengthwise of his back. 
 He has a white face and whiteish feet, and two long horns, 
 or antennae. He is an active, stirring felrbw in the night, 
 and has his mouth armed with a pair of sharp, horny mandi- 
 bles, with which he can cut through substances quite hard-
