[July. 

We once imprisoned one in a tumbler, over which we tied 
 several thickness of thick, strong paper. He kept the peace 
 during the day, but in the night he cut a hole in the paper, 
 and '■ vamosed" before morning. He generally lies quietly 
 during the clay, and performs what he has to do during the 
 darkness. The perfect or winged insect does no other inju- 
 ry, that we know of, except depositing its eggs in the bark 
 of the apple tree. It is the worm or maggot, which does the 
 mischief, by boring into the tree, and cutting off, as it bur- 
 ix ws along under the bark, the communication or channels 
 of sap between the top and roots. 

Newly Invented Horse Shoe. 

A patent has recently been granted to a mechanic of Phil- 
 adelphia, for an improvement in the method of fastening 
 horse-shoes. The invention consists in the construction of 
 inclined flanges or lips, rising from the front sides of the 
 shoe corresponding in form with the parts of the hoof 
 against which they are made to bear, when fitted. One of 
 the side flanges is made separate, and fastened by sliding 
 into a recess in the side of the shoe, and secured by means 
 of a screw, thus entirely dispensing with the use of nails, and 
 avoiding any liability to injury by pricking. 

Colza Oil. 

This beautiful oil, which is used in all the French light- 
 houses, and which is superior to sperm for such purposes, 
 should arrest the attention of our oil dealers and farmers. 
 The plants from which it is obtained, we have no doubt, can 
 be cultivated with success in various parts of our country, 
 and if this can be done it should be attended to. — Scientific

Roots of Trees in Pipe Drains. 
 Where drains have to be laid near the roots of trees, it 
 is important that they should be well bedded in cement, 
 at those places, and every small opening effectually 
 closed. Whenever the water can get in the roots also will 
 find their way, and eventually cause much trouble in the 
 stoppage of the drain. 

The Albany (N. Y.) Knickerbocker says: — " A first class 
 Shanghai cock will eat as much corn as a horse. In con- 
 sequence of this, it is not profitable to grow Shanghais, un- 
 less you can buy oats for ten cents a bushel, or sell eggs for 
 four shillings apiece. 

How to Make a Horse Carry his Tail Straight. 
 I had a very fine colt, that carried his tail on one side, and 
 was continually throwing it over the driving lino, when to 
 cure him of this habit, I braided a loop in his tail and tied it 
 with a string to the trace on the same side on which he car- 
 ried it, and when he found it was tied he would pull on it, 
 when I would let him up a little gradually on the string until 
 at length he came to carry his tail perfectly straight. — Bos- 
 ton Cultivator. 

We see it stated that the Executive Committee of the 
 Virginia State Agricultural Society, have determined this 
 year to place tho entire management and arrangement of 
 the departments of "Household and Domestic Manufactures," 
 Flowers," and "Ladies Ornamental and Fancy Works" in 
 the hands of the ladies. • 

Mammoth Calf. 
 A cow belonging to William Creamer, near Bareville, Lan- 
 caster county, recently gave birth to a calf, weighing 125 lbs. 

It was well formed in every respect and healthy. The breed 
 is not stated. , 

Orchard Grass. 

To the Editor of the Farm Journal : — As a great 
 deal of Orchard grass seed is sown and sent from the 
 districts around Philadelphia, can you give us the best 
 mode of cleaning the seed. It being so light, presents a 
 difficulty which is not found in preparing Timothy and 
 other heavier seeds for market. Orchard grass is a good 
 deal cultivated iu this neighborhood, in connection with 
 clover, principally for grazing purposes. The first crop 
 is usually cut for hay, and we must continue to grow it 
 'till a better substitute is found. The various Rye grasses 
 do not appear to succeed so well in our climate, though 
 they are greatly esteemed in England. The Italian Rye 
 grass is more valued than the Perennial, and the seed 
 commands a higher price. "Pacey's" appears to be more 
 highly appreciated than any variety of this family. By 
 some late experiments, it is observed that the Italian 
 Rye grass (Lolium perenne) sown with Alsike clover 
 (Trifolium hybridum) is said to yield for hay and pas- 
 ture the best crop as to quality and bulk of product. It 
 is sown either with or without grain. Which do you con- 
 sider best in sowing grass seeds (particularly Timothy,) 
 with grain, or alone ? SUBSCRIBER.

. • An Inquiry. 

Mr. Darlington : — Will some of your numerous readers 
 inform a young farmer of the utility of Lime Spreaders, 
 Cooper's or others. I have about twenty thousand bushels 
 of lime burnt, and as the ordinary way of spreading it with 
 shovels is very tedious, and withal not very pleasant work, 
 and seeing an advertisement in the "Farm Journal" of a 
 Lime Spreader, Lewis Cooper's, which proposes to do the 
 work of six men and to spread the lime more evenly, I was 
 induced to make this inquiry. Any information in regard to 
 their practicability, the number of bushels one hand can 
 spread with them in a day, and anything else pertaining to 
 them will be thankfully received by

Sowing Corn Fodder. 
 Mr. J. L. Darlington : — Dear Sir : — Your corres- 
 pondent, George Walker, in March No., says," by the use 
 of a corn-stalk cutter which he used last winter in cut- 
 ting corn fodder, he saved at least twenty tons of hay, 
 in consequence of which he was enabled to keep fifty-six 
 head of horned cattle and five horses, being twice the 
 number he was able to keep under the old and wasteful 
 mode of feeding corn stalks without first being cut with 
 a good machine. This we think is a misrepresentation 
 of the subject ; we do not doubt that the cutting of the 
 corn fodder is a great saving to hay, but we have from 
 good authority, that thirty or upwards of those cows, he 
 did not have until after Christmas (the last of December), 
 and he has bought ten tons of hay and fed it out, and if 
 he keeps them until grass grows he will have to buy 
 more than ten tons. Such stories as this are not credit- 
 able in this part of the state, I know not what they may 
 be in Philadelphia. Yours,
