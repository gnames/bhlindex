Resolved, That Dr. A. L. Elwyn, John Strohm, and 
 Wm. Jessup, be a committee whose duty it shall be to 
 select a proper person for that purpose and that they 
 make report to the next meeting of the Board. 

P. S. — After the Board had taken action upon the 
 foregoing report and resolutions, a gentleman of Dauphin 
 County, a member of the Executive Committee of the 
 State Agricultural Society, appeared before the Board, 
 and said that at the next ' meeting, the citizens of 
 Dauphin county, to induce tire location of the School 
 here, would offer to pay the sum of ten thousand dol- 
 lars, and- with' a view to its attainment la.% would head 
 the subscription with one thousand dollars. A delega- 
 tion of Messrs. Geo. W. Patton and John Morrow from 
 the county of Blair, on behalf of her citizens^ proposed 
 that they would purchase and pay for two hundred acres 
 of land of Col. Baker, in addition to what he offers 
 gratuituousily. Thus presenting to the Board a grant of 
 four hundred acres on condition of the location of the 
 School there. 

A communication was received from Joseph Baily, and 
 referred to the committee having charge of the subject, 
 inviting the Trustees to look at a large tract of land in 
 Perry county he proposes to sell upon liberal terms to 
 the Farmers' High School. 

A communication was received from Algernon S. 
 Roberts, stating that the imperative demands of public 
 business prevented his attendance. 

On motion of John Strohm, the proceedings of this 
 meeting were ordered to be published, with the request 
 that all papers in the State would copy the same. On 
 motion the Board adjourned.

Summer Pruning. 

We copy below from Barry's Fruit Book some general 
 principles in respect to pruning trees, by the Professor 
 of Arboriculture in the garden of plants at Rouen, in 
 France. 

There is hardly any branch of horticulture less under- 
 stood and more neglected than judicious pruning. At 
 this season particularly, much much may be done to 
 promote fruitfulness, and regulate the form of the tree. 
 Every one can understand how, by pinching off now an 
 over luxnriant branch, or shortening instead of letting it 
 grow and the wood mature, you economise sap, or con- 
 centrate in the remaining branch what would otherwise 
 have gone to form useless wood, to be pruned off next 
 winter or spring. This concentration of sap often de- 
 velopes fruit buds, where otherwise there woiud only 
 have been groivfh buds. There is no more interesting 
 branch of horticulture than this frequent attention to 
 pruning, watching the development of branches, train- 
 ing and regulating their shape, so as to admit free access 
 of all to sun and air. It is not much attention that is 
 wanted, but little and often. We hardly know which of 
 the two evils among fruit growers is most prevalent : 
 entire neglect of pruning, or unsparing injudicious mu- 
 tilation with axe and saw. We commend the following 
 rules to the attention of all our readers : 

"The theory of the pruning of fruit trees rests on the 
 following six general principles : 

"1. The vigor of a tree, subjected to pruning, de- 

pends, in a great measure, on the equal distribution of 
 sap in all its branches. 

"In fruit trees abandoned to themselves, the sap is 
 equally distributed in different parts without any other 
 aid than nature, because the tree assumes the form most 
 in harmony with the natural tendency of the sap. 

"But in those submitted to pruning, it is different; 
 the forms imposed on them, such as espalier, pyramid, 
 vase, &c., change more or less the normal direction of 
 the sap, and' prevent it from taking the form proper to 
 its species. Thus nearly all the forms given to trees 
 require the development of ramifications more or less 
 numerous, and of greater or less dimensions at the base 
 of the stem. And, as the sap tends by preference 
 towards the summit of the tree, it happens that, unless 
 great care be taken, the branches at the base become 
 feeble, and finally dry up, and the form intended to be 
 obtained disappears, to be replaced by the natural form, 
 that is a stem of a trunk with a branching head. It is 
 then indispensable, if we wish to preserve the form we 
 impose upon trees, to employ certain means, by the aid 
 of which the natural direction of the sap can be changed 
 and directed towards the points where we wish to obtain 
 the most vigorous growth. To do this we must arrest 
 vegetation in the parts to which the sap is carried in too 
 great abundance, and on the contrary favor the parts 
 that do not receive enough. To accomplish this the 
 following means must be successively employed : 

"1. Prune the branches of the most vigorous parts 
 very short, and those of the weak parts long. We know 
 that the sap is attracted by the leaves. The removal of 
 a large number of wood-buds from the vigorous parts, 
 deprives these parts of the leaves which these buds 
 would have produced ; consequently the sap is attracted 
 there in less quantities, and the growth thereby dimin- 
 ished. The feeble parts being pruned long, present a 
 great number of buds, which produce a large surface of 
 leaves, and these attract the sap and acquire a vigorous 
 growth. This principle holds good in all trees, under 
 whatever form they may be conducted. 

"2. Leave a large quantity of fruit on the strong part, 
 and remove the whole, or greater part, from the feeble. 
 We know already that the fruit has the property of at- 
 tracting to it the sap from the roots, and of employing 
 it entirely to its own growth. The necessary result of 
 this is, What we are about to point out, viz., that all the 
 sap, which arrives in the strong parts, will be absorbed 
 by the fruits, and the wood there, in consequence, will 
 make but little growth, while on the feeble parts, de- 
 prived of fruits, the sap will all be appropriated by the 
 growing parts, and they will increase in size and 
 strength. 

"3. Bend the strong parts and keep the weak erect. 
 The more erect the branches and stem are, the greater 
 will be the flow of sap to the growing parts ; hence, the 
 feeble parts being erect, attract much more sap than the 
 strong parts inclined, and, consequently, make a more 
 vigorous growth, and soon recover their balance. This 
 remedy is more especially applied to espalier trees. 

"4. Remove from the vigorous parts the superfluous 
 shoots as early in the season as possible, and from the 
 feeble parts as late as possible. The fewer the number 
 of young shoots there are on a branch, the fewer there
