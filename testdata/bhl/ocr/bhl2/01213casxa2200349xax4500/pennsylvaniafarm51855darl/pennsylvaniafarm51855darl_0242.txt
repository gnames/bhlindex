are of leaves, and consequently the less is the sap at- 
 tracted there. Hence, in leaving the young shoots on 
 the feeble part, their leaves attract the sap there, and 
 induce a vigorous growth. 

"5. Pinch early the soft extremities of the shoots on 
 the vigorous parts, and as late as possible on the feeble 
 parts, excepting always any shoots which may be too 
 vigorous for their position. By thus pinching early the 
 strong part, the. flow of sap to that point is checked, and 
 naturally turns to the growing parts that have not been 
 pinched ; this remedy is applicable to trees in all forms. 

" 6. Lay in the strong shoots on the trellis early, and 
 leave the feeble parts loose as long as possible. Laying 
 in the strong parts obstructs the circulation of the sap 
 in them, and consequently favors the weak parts that 
 are loose. This is only applicable to espaliers. 

" 7. In espalier trees, giving the feeble parts the ben- 
 efit of the light, and confining the strong parts more in 
 the shade, restores a balance, for light is the agent 
 which enables leaves to perform their functions and 
 their action on the roots, and the parts receiving the 
 greatest proportion of it acquire the most vigorous de- 
 velopment. 

2. "The sap acts with greater force and produces 
 more vigorous growth on a branch or shoot pruned 
 short, than on one pruned long. This is easily explain- 
 ed. The sap acting on two buds must evidently produce 
 a greater development of wood on them, than if it were 
 divided between fifteen or twenty buds. 

" It follows from this, that if we wish to obtain wood 
 branches, we prune short, for vigorous shoots produce 
 few fruit buds. On the contrary, if we wish to obtain 
 fruit branches, we prune long, because the most slender 
 or feeble shoots are the most disposed to fruit. 

"Another application of this principle is to prune 
 short for a year or two, such trees or parts as have be- 
 come enfeebled by overbearing. (This principle de- 
 serves especial attention, as its application is of great 
 importance.) 

3. "The sap tending always to the extremities of the 
 shoots causes the terminal bud to push with greater 
 vigor than the laterals. According to this principle, 
 when we wish a prolongment of a stem or branch, we 
 should prune to a vigorous bud, and leave no production 
 that can interfere with the action of the sap on it. 

4. "The more the sap is obstructed in its circulation, 
 the more likely it will be to produce fruit buds. This 
 principle is founded on a fact to which we have already 
 had occasion to refer, viz., that the sap circulating slow- 
 ly is subjected to a more complete elaboration in the 
 tissues of the tree, and becomes better adapted to the 
 formation of fruit buds. 

"This principle can be applied to produce the follow- 
 ing result: When we wish to produce fruit buds on a 
 branch, we prevent a free circulation of the sap by 
 bending the branches, or by making annular or circular 
 incisions on it ; and on the contrary, when we wish to 
 change a fruit branch into a wood branch, we give it a 
 vertical position, or prune it to two or three buds, on 
 which we concentrate the action of the sap and thus in- 
 duce their vigorous development. 

5. "The leaves serve to prepare the sap absorbed by 
 the rootp for the nourishment of the tree, and aid the 

formation of buds on the shoots. All trees, therefore, 
 deprived of their leaves are liable to perish. This prin- 
 ciple shows how dangerous it is to remove a large quan- 
 tity of leaves from trees, under the pretext of aiding the 
 growth or ripenirig of fruits, for the leaves are the nour- 
 ishing organs, and the trees deprived of them cannot 
 continue to grow, neither can the fruit; and the bi'attches 
 so stripped will have feeble, ill-formed buds, which will, 
 the following year, produce a weak and sickly growth. 
 6. "Where the buds of any shoot or branch do not 
 develope before the age of two years, they can only be 
 forced into activity by a very close pruning, and in some 
 cases, as the peach, this even will often fail. This last 
 principle shows the importance of pruning the main 
 branches pf .espaliers particularly, so as to ensure the 
 development of the buds of their successive sections, 
 and to preserve well the side shoots thus produced, for 
 without this, the interior of the tree will become naked 
 and unproductive, and a remedy will be very difficult." 

Dwarf Fruit Trees. 

The intention of names bemg to designate things, the 
 term dwarf as usually understood and applied to Fruit 
 Trees, is unfortunate, giving as it often does entirely a 
 wrong impression. 

The belief is very common that a dwarf Pear or 
 Apple tree, means one that win only grow four or five 
 feet high, and bear perhaps at the most a dozen speci- 
 mens. Many also understand the term to apply to the 
 fruit itself, which they think only grows to about half 
 the ordinary size, 

We have surprised many persons, by telling them that 
 we have weighed Duchesse d'Angouleme Pears from 
 what are called dwarf trees, reaching, nineteen and half 
 ounces and that we could show them dwarf trees in this 
 city twelve to fifteen feet high, and bearing from five to 
 six bushels of Pears annually. What is usually meant 
 by a dwarf Pear tre$, is one grafted on a Quince 
 stock, with branches starting out near the ground, and 
 not trimmed up to the usual height for standard trees. 

The operation of making dwarf Pear and Apple trees, 
 is performed by budding the former on Quince, and the 
 latter on Paradise or Doncain stock. This has the effect 
 with many varieties of restraining a very rapid growth, 
 and developing early fruiting, although this latter de- 
 pends much on judicious pruning. Such trees are made 
 to branch out, one or two feet from the ground, not only 
 on account of the convenience of picking the fruit but 
 also because the shape of the head, and the shortening 
 in process of the branches, is within easier control. The 
 common practice of letting branches start at the height 
 of six or seven feet is sanctioned neither by convenience 
 or sound philosophy. With a variable climate, and 
 sudden alternations of heat and cold, wet and dry, the 
 exposure of a naked trunk to such influences, often 
 affect its thriftiness, producing blight and other diseases, 
 and sometimes destroying life. This is particularly the 
 case with Cherry and Pear trees. When the branches 
 are low, they answer a valuable purpose in shading and 
 protecting the trunk, and both on dwarf and standard, 
 trees, in this respect, nature should be more closely fol- 
 lowed. An objection is made to it, that the grass will 
 not grow underneath, and that the passage among the
