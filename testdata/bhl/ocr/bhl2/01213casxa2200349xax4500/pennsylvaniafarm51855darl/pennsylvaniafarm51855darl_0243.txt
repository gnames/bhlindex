trees is interrupted. Things ought to be kept in their 
 proper places. A Lawn in front of the house, should be 
 reserved for shade, not fruit trees. There is always a 
 separate vegetable garden, and there ought also to be a 
 fruit garden reserved exclusively for fruit trees. These 
 require particular treatment, and attention, such as oc- 
 casional ploughing up of the ground, which is imprac- 
 ticable in a lawn, but absolutely necessary, for a thriv- 
 ing orchard. 

Spreading Manure — Mulching. 

After Harvest, one of the first and most important 
 operations on the farm requiring attention, is the haul- 
 ing out of manure, and preparation of the ground 'for 
 wheat. Practical farmers diifer much on these points, 
 some recommending but a single ploughing others 
 ploughing twice, some spreading but a small portion of 
 their manure at a time, and ploughing it down as soon 
 as possible to prevent loss by evaporation, others pre- 
 fering to spread it early and allow it to lay as long as 
 possible exposed to the hot sun. Upon inquiring of this 
 latter class, and quite a numerous one too, they have 
 replied to us, as a reason for their doing so "that the 
 manure is sour, and the sun siveetens it. We have re- 
 peatedly heard cases cited of experiments tried side by 
 side, in one case of manure being ploughed down as 
 soon as possible, and in the other of letting it be ex- 
 posed for weeks, to the atmosphere, and the wheat on 
 the latter proved far heavier, other circumstances being 
 the same. 

Practical results, are the best tests of the soundness 
 of any theory, They are what farmers most care for, 
 who are right too in rejecting all scientific explana- 
 tions, not confirmed by their own experience, or which 
 is disproved by their constant practice. Still the saddle 
 should be put on the right horse. The failure or suc- 
 cess of any operation on the farm, must be traced to its 
 true cause._ It is hardly doing justice to the patient 
 explorer of the arcana of nature to interrupt his chain 
 of inductive reasoning, by attributing results to causes 
 with which they have no connection whatever, and then 
 exclaim against book farming. 

In the case of alleged benefit, from exposure of 
 manure to the surface, the result is truly attributable, 
 not to the manure " being sweetened," by the hot sun, 
 butlto the mulching or covering of the suface of the 
 ground, and which would have been produoed equally by 
 dry straw, hay, shavings. At least this has always 
 been our opinion. 

Barnyard manure may lose its most valuable ammon- 
 iacal constituents, by exposure, and evaporation, but 
 it cannot possibly gain anything. The theory if it 
 proves anything, proves too much. Were it true, in- 
 stead of keeping our manure under sheds, covering with 
 straw or earth to preserve and absorb its valuable 
 ; uices, we should be continually turning it over so as to 
 expose every portion to evaporation and thus entirely get 
 rid of the "sourness." This we all know is opposed to 
 the practice of every good farmer. Mulching the sur- 
 face of the ground, with a view to fertilize it, is pur- 
 sued in England, as a regular system, under the title 
 of Gurneyism. In this country we know but little about 
 it, excepting as an application around trees, strawberry 

beds &c, but in so changeable' a climate as ours, 
 there is no doubt it would often be found very valuable. 

Waring in his Elements, says the improvement from 
 mulching arises 1st. 

"1. The evaporation of water from the soil is prevent- 
 ed during drought by the shade afforded by the mulch ; 
 and is is therefore kept in better condition, as to mois- 
 ture and temperature, than when evaporation goes on 
 more freely. This condition is well calculated to ad- 
 vance the chemical changes necessary to prepare the 
 matters — both organic and mineral — in the soil for the 
 use of plants. 

2. By preventing evaporation, we partially protect the 
 soil from losing ammonia resultant from decaying 
 organic matter. 

3. A heavy mulch breaks the force of rains, and pre- 
 vents them from compacting the soil, as would be the 
 result, were no such precaution taken. 

4. Mulching protects the surface-soil from freezing as 
 readily as when exposed, and thus keeps it longer open 
 for the admission of air and moisture. When unpro- 
 tected, the soil early becomes frozen ; and all water 
 falling, instead of entering as it should do, passes off on 
 the surface. 

5. The throwing out of winter grain is often pre- 
 vented, because this is due to the freezing of the sur- 
 face-soil. 

G. Mulching prevents the growth of some weeds, 
 because it removes from them the fostering heat of the 
 sun. , 

Many of the best nursery-men keep the soil about the 
 roots of young trees mulched continually. One of the 
 chief arguments for this treatment is, that it prevents 
 the removal of the moisture from the soil and the con- 
 sequent loss of heat. Also that it keeps up a full sup- 
 ply of water for the uses of the roots, because it keeps 
 the soil cool, and causes a desposit of dew. 

7. It also prevents the " baking" of the soil, or the 
 formation of a crust." 

In England they often remove the mulch from field to 
 field, and consider that it pays well for the expense. 

We have entire faith from our own experience in 
 mulching the surface of the ground, for several of our 
 crops, besides its more customary application, around 
 the triiuks of trees but we have no confidence what- 
 ever in exposing manures to evaporation, or allowing 
 their juices to drain away, for want of protection and 
 covering;. 

Farmers' Reading Room in Philadelphia. 
 There are some projects to promote the Public Inter- 
 ests which when' once suggested, excite general surprise 
 that they had not been started before, their utility being 
 so very apparent. Of this character we think is the plan 
 for a reading room in Philadelphia for farmers. The 
 Philadelphia society for promoting agriculture have un- 
 der appointment a committee, to confer with other com- 
 mittees from several of our neighboring counties, who 
 now have the matter in hand, and are looking out for a 
 suitable location. The market taverns, being generally 
 along market street, some place within a square of that 
 street is urged by many as most desirable. To carry out 
 the object fully we think the room should be open at all
