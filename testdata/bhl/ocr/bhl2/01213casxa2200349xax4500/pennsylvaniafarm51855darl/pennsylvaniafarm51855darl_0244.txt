THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[Aucust 

times both day and evening, lighted and warmed, when 
 the season requiries it, so as to make it a pleasant place 
 of resort not only for market farmers, who attend the 
 city regularly, but also for our agricultural friends at a 
 distance who come occasionally. There ought to be 
 found at all times on the table, agricultural periodicals 
 from every section of the Union, and also the leading 
 standard agricultural works. , 

Models of new and improved implements would also 
 soon find their way there, and we believe the reading 
 room once fairly started, on a suitable scale for conveni- 
 ence and comfort, would be found a general rendezvous 
 for the friends of agriculture, from both near and dis- 
 tant points. 

The report of the joint committee is looked for with 
 much interest. . ,, 

Horticulturist. 

The first number of the above, since its removal to 
 Philadelphia has fully satisfied public expectation, and 
 gratified its friends in every- section of the union. The 
 new editor shows himself fully equal to his position and 
 while fully acknowledging the deserved reputation of the 
 Horticulturist, under the control of Downing and Barry, 
 we must also say from the number before us, and as a 
 matter of justice all around, that we consider it in no 
 respect inferior to any which have preceded it. 

The price is as usual $2. per year. R. P. Smith,

Industrial and Agricultural Exhibition at Doylestown. 
 The above display of our Bucks County friends, will 
 come off on the 21, 22, 23, and 24 of present month. — 
 They have issued a famous handbill, with an engraving 
 of a miniature Crystal Palace on its face indicating we 
 presume the shape and proportions of the building 
 erected to display the various articles of competition. 
 The premium list is of the most extensive character, em- 
 tracing a gentleman's department, "a ladies and artist's 
 department," a "father's and mother's department" 
 for babies, " equestrian department, &c. Three ad- 
 dresses are to be delivered, one on Tuesday by Horaoe 
 Greely, on Wednesday by John P. Hale, and on Thurs- 
 day by some other distinguished speaker. Our friends 
 are proposing to take a wide swathe, and we hope they 
 will be successful. 

Tall stalks of Wheat and Rye in Pennsylvania. 

If any of our readers, can exceed the following, we 
 shall be glad to hear from them. . 

Peter Wagner, Esq., of Limestone in Montour Co., 
 exhibited this season some stalks of rye, measuring 
 eight feet two inches ; and wheat five feet ten inches. 

Jacob Sechler sen. of Danville in same county, ex- 
 hibited, stalks of wheat measuring seven feet, eleyen 
 inches and a quarter, The heads of the. latter, as well 
 as the grains, were large and well filled. 

Fruit Growers Hand Book. 

By W. G. Waring, Boalsburg Pa. — -The above is a 

very valuable compendium of knowledge for the Fruit 

Grower, which ought to be more generally known. Part 

1st. contains an extensive list and description of the 

most valuable fruits in cultivation, and Part 2d. direc- 
 tions -'how, when and where to plant, with rules for 
 the successful and economical culture of Fruit Trees 
 and Tlants." It is illustrated with engravings, and 
 deserves extensive circulation.' Were such works more 
 sought for and studied we should not hear of so many 
 failures in tree planting and so much inferior fruit. 

Drilling Wheat. 
 As the season for seeding is again at hand, we would 
 urge every farmer, who does not own a wheat drill, to 
 procure one without delay. Were there not other in- 
 ducements to do so, the experience of last winter of the 
 advantages of drilling would be conclusive. We heard 
 of many places, and indeed in nearly every neighbor- 
 hood in this section of the State, there were cases where 
 the drilled wheat stood the winter well, and' has since 
 yielded a plentiful hai-vest, while that sown broadcast, 
 and covered with the harrow, was very much killed out 
 and injured. The reasons in favor of drilling in are, 
 that the wheat is covered deeper, it is dropped and cov- 
 ered with, more regularity, and it requires less seed. 
 Pennock's improved grain drill is probably as j^erfect an 
 implement for this purpose as can be devised: It is 
 calculated for wheat, oats and grass seeds, is well made, 
 and at the same time free from all complexity. Jt can 
 be thrown in and out of gear by a single movement. 
 After experiments for a series of years to adapt it en- 
 tirely to the wants of the farmers, the Messrs. Pen- 
 nocks, inventors and manufacturers, consider their pre- 
 sent drill as combining every thing that can be wanted. 
 The price of the seven tubed drill is $65 ; eight tubed, 
 $70 ; nine tubed, $75 ; ten tubed, $80. The grass seed 
 sower costs an additional $10 ; oats sower, $5 ; and the 
 guano attachment, $15. We give these prices for the 
 information of our friends at a distance who may wish 
 to order. 

Domestic Recipes. 

Washington Fritters. — Boil four large potatoes ; 
 peel them ; and, when cold, grate them as fine as possi- 
 ble. Mix well together two large table-spoonfuls of 
 cream, two table spoonfuls of sweet white wine, half a 
 grated nutmeg two table spoonfuls of powdered sugar, 
 and the juice of a lemon. Beat eight eggs very 
 light, (omitting the whites of two,) and then mix them 
 gradually with the cream, wine, &c, alternately with 
 the grated potatoe, a little' at a time of each. Beat 
 the whole together at least a quarter of an hour 
 after all the ingredients are mixed. Have ready, in a 
 frying-pan over the fire, a large quantity of boiling 
 lard; and when the bubbling has subsided, put in spoon, 
 fuls of the batter, so as to make well-formed fritters. 
 Fry them a light brown, and take them up with a per- 
 forated skimmer, so as to drain them from the lard. 
 Lay them on a hot dish, and send immediately to table. 
 Serve up with them, in a boat, a sauce made in the pro- 
 portion of two glasses of white wine, the juice of two 
 lemons, and a table-spoonful of peach-water, or a glass 
 of rose-water. Make the sauce very sweet with pow- 
 dered white sugar, and grate nutmeg into it. 

These fritters may be made with boiled sweet potatoes, 
 crated when cold.
