Bread Fritters — Pick, wash, and dry half a pound 
 of Zante currants, and having spread them out on a flat 
 dish, dredge them well with flour. Grate some bread 
 into a 'pan, till you have a pint of crumbs. Pour over 
 the grated bread a pint of boiling milk, into which you 
 have stirred, as soon as taken from the fire, a piece of 
 fresh butter, the size of an egg. Cover the pan, and let 
 it stand an hour. Then beat it hard, and add nutmeg, 
 and a quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar, 
 stirred in gradually, and two table-sgopnfuls^of the best 
 brandy. Beat six eggs till very light, and then stir 
 them, by. degrees, into the mixture. Lastly, add the 
 currants, a few at a time; and beat the whole very hard. 
 It should be a thick batter. If you find it too thin, add 
 a little flour. Have ready over the fire a hot frying- pan 
 with boiling lard. Put in the batter in large spoon- 
 fuls, .(so as not- to touch,) and fry the- fritters a light 
 brown. Drain them on a perforated skimmer, -or an in- 
 verted sieve placed in a deep pan, and send them to 
 table hot. Eat them with wine, and powdered su- 
 gar. 

Instead of currants, you may use sultana raisins, cut 
 in half and well floured, 

Orange Tarts. — Take six or seven fine large sweet 
 oranges ; roll them under your hand on a table to in- 
 crease the juice, and then squeeze them through a 
 strainer over half a pound or more of powdered loaf- 
 sugar. Mix- the orange-juice and the sugar thoroughly 
 together. Use none of the peel. Break twelve eggs 
 into a large shallow pan, and .beat them till thick and 
 smooth. Then stir in, gradually, the orange-juice and 
 sugar. Have ready a sufficiency of the best puff-paste, 
 roll it out thin, and line some patty-pans with it, having 
 first buttered them inside. Then fill them with the 
 orange-mixture, and set them immediately into rather 
 brisk oven. Bake the tarts a light brown ; and when 
 done, set to cool. When quite cold, take them out of 
 the patty-pans, put them on a large dish, and grate 
 sugar over their tops. 

Lemon tarts may be made in a similar manner, but 
 they require double the quantity of sugar. 

For baking tarts it is well to use (instead of tin patty- 
 pans (small deep plates •of china or white-ware, with 
 broad flat edges, little soup-plates. You can then have 
 all round the edge a rim of paste ornamentally notched. 
 In notching the edge of a tart, (this must, of course, be 
 done before it goes into the oven,) use a sharp knife. — 
 Make the cuts at equal distances about an inoh broad, 
 so as to form squares. Turn upwards one square, and 
 leave the next one down ; and so on all round the edge. 
 This is the chevaux-de-J'rize pattern. For the shell-pat- 
 tern, having notched the edge of the paste into squares, 
 turn up one half of every square, giving the corner a 
 fold down. The paste should always be thickest round 
 the rim or edge. 

All tarts are best the day they are baked ; but they 
 should never be sent to table warm. 

A Sweet Omelet. — Break small in an earthen pan six 
 maccaroons made with bitter almonds, and mix with 
 them a dozen orange-blossoms pounded to paste. If the 
 orange-flowers are quite blown, the fragrance and flavour 
 will be finer. If more convenient, substitute for the 
 blossoms a large wine-glass of orange-flower water. Add 

six ounces of powdered loaf-sugar, and mix all well 
 together. Separate the whites from the yolks of six 
 eggs. Beat the yolks in broad earthen pan till very light 
 and smooth, and add to them, gradually, the other in- 
 gredients. Have ready the whites beaten to a stiff froth, 
 and stir them in at the last, a little at a time. Put four 
 ounces of fresh butter into an omelet pan (or a small, 
 clean, short-handled frying-pan, tinned or enamelled in- 
 side.) Set it over hot coals, and when the butter is all 
 melted put in the omelet-batter; which some one should 
 continue to beat till the last minute. When the omelet 
 has^become hot and has begun to colour, transfer it to a 
 well buttered dish. Place it instantly in a ratlier brisk 
 oven and bake it from five to ten minutes, till it is a 
 light-yellowish brown, and puffed up high. Sift pow- 
 dered sugar over it as quickly as possible, and carry 
 it immediately to the dinner-table ; handing it round 
 rapidly for every one to take a piece, as it falls very 
 soon. 

These omelets are served up at dinner-parties imme- 
 diately on the removal of the meats. 

They must be made, cooked, served up, eaten with 
 great celerity. Therefore it is not usual to commence 
 mixing a sweet or soufflee omelet, till after the company 
 has set down to dinner. 

If exactly followed, this receipt will be found ex- 
 cellent. 

An Address by Governor Bigler. 
 The Philad. Society for Promoting Agriculture, has 
 secured the services of Ex-Gov. Bigler, as orator on 
 the occasion of its exhibition in September. This 
 will add much to its interest, and a sound, practical 
 and valuable address may be expected. Appearances 
 indicate that the exhibition will be a most successful 
 one, creditable to the society and to the city 

Sale of Short Horns. 

The fine herd of short-horns belonging to Mr. John S. 
 Tanqueray, at Hendon, near London, was sold by auc- 
 tion last week, by Mr. Strafford, and realized very high 
 pi'ices — 77 cows and heifers nearly 6000Z., and 23 bulls 
 about 200CM. The largest amount for any single animal 
 was 500 guineas, for a splendid red roan cow, named 
 "Oxford," calved in August, 1849, and knocked down to 
 Mr. Gunter. "Marmaduke," a roan bull calf, 11 weeks 
 old, realized 100 guineas. The most extensive and spirited 
 buyers were from the United States and from Adelaide, 
 Australia. Prince Albert, the Earl of Burlington, Lord 
 Feversham, Sir Chas. Knightly, Mr. Topham, Mr. Jonas 
 Webb, and Mr. Kirkham, were also announced as pur- 
 chasers. 

On Friday last, the celebrated stock of short-horned 
 cattle, the property of the late John Bolden, Esq., of 
 Hying, Lancashire, was sold by Mr. Strafford. Mr. Torr 
 bought the highest priced animal, viz., Lady Hopetown, 
 for 20gs,, and Gertrude for 100 gs. 

Frosted Potatoes. 
 Frosted potatoes may be rendered as good as ever by 
 being' soaked for aboutten minutes in salt and water 
 previous to boiling.
