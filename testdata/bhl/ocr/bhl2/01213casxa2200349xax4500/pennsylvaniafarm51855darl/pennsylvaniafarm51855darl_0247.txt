among the short-horns, and remember that it was an origi- 
 nal characteristic of the tribe, it appears to me of great con- 
 sequence, considering the national importance of dairy pro- 
 duce, to use every exertion to render so valuable a quality 
 permanent. Good milkers are not over abundant among 
 any variety of the vaccine species, and are most scarce 
 among ill-bred mongrels. Mr. Atten, of Longcroft, had 
 two or three years a white cow of the name of Penguin, de- 
 scended from the stock of Mr. Robertson, of Ladykirk, 
 which was an extraordinary milker. Colonel Kingscote's 
 cow Honeysuckle is remarkable even in his herd, where this 
 point is so successfully cultivated, for the same quality. 
 Mr. Sainsbury is strenuous in attaining high excellence here 
 as in every other point. Among my own cows, which are 
 milking better this year than lever knew them before, I 
 may be allowed to name one which at nine years old is a 
 most extraordinary milker, viz., Jessy, bred by Mr. R. Bell. 
 She is by Napoleon (10552) dam by Cleveland' Lad (3407)-, 
 &c, and has bred a prize heifer. She may therefore be 
 cited as a proof that it is possible to combine the quality 
 for which I am contending with the best short-horn blood. 

In conclusion I may add that I am preparing for publi- 
 cation an article on the breeding of short-horns, and shall 
 therefore feel obliged for any communications from breeders 
 containing facts in reference to this or other points worthy 
 of notice. I shall also be glad to show my small herd to 
 any breeder who may happen to be visiting this neighbor- 
 Lood.' They are as hardly kept as those of any neighboring 
 farmer, and as my object is to make cheese, the calves are 
 weaned from new milk at an earlier age than is usual among 
 the breeders of short-horns. — Willoughhy Wood, London Ag-

The Greatness of Little Things. 

In Lieut. Maury's recent work on the Physical Geography 
 of the Sea, he gives the result of microscopic examinations 
 of some shells drawn up from the bottom of the Atlantic 
 Ocean, where it is more than two miles in depth. These 
 shells are so minute that to the naked eye they appear like 
 common dust or clay, although not a grain of sand. is among 
 them ; and yet are so preserved that their most delicate 
 edges are perfect. It would require a larger grave to hold 
 all the small insects of the world than all the elephants. The 
 smallest insects of the ocean, not the largest, are the most 
 important occupants, and the microscopic shell fish create 
 more important changes than the whales. 

It has been the great error of historians, statesmen, and 
 politicians, to lose sight of this truth. They look entirely at 
 the whales, the big fish, and seem to consider these as the 
 monarchs of the deep sea of politics, and they alone have a 
 right to swim there. If the French Emperor flounders, or 
 the Russian Autocrat turns over on his side and dies, each 
 contortion is truly chronicled. But in the mean time, what 
 do wo hear of the progress of the people, the industrious 
 classes, the small fish? They are the true monarchs of this 
 great and wide sea of politics after all. They form the 
 strata by which the geologist of history will hereafter mark 
 the progress of this ago, and classify all its products, and 
 upon tho basis of which all future society will develop itself. 
 Take care of the poor and the rich will take care of them- 
 selves. Educate -the masses, and there will arise from the 
 number a sufficiently large class to generalize their ideas, 
 and carry out their principles. Reform the people, make 
 them temperate, truthful and virtuous, for they give tone 
 and temper to the age and to the country, determining the 
 character of its leaders, far more than the leaders that of 
 the masses. 

And so in individual life and character. It is little things 

that make and unmake us all. There are thousands of young 
 men of genius and enterprise at this moment, who dream of 
 fame and distinction, and who, if it only required some 
 great act of daring or sacrifice within tho scope of human 
 possibility to become distinguished, would bo heroes; but 
 because true eminence is only to be attained by a perseve- 
 ring application in a number of daily virtues, are constantly 
 at war with the whole scheme of things, and esteem it a 
 very badly governed world in which they find no higher 
 place. 

It is a man'6 habit of dress, demeanor and conversation, 
 that make or unmake friends, on which his success and hap- 
 piness in life depend. It is on a man's little habits of eat- 
 ing and drinking, or loitering over trifles, or knowing how 
 to brush them aside, that his character of idleness or indus- 
 try, and the occupation of the largest part of tine depend. 
 It is the way in which a man takes care of the pennies in 
 his pecuniary transactions, that determines whether he will 
 ever take care of pounds. 

Little habitsr drivo nails into our coffins. They more than 
 make up by their number, what they seem to lack in individ- 
 ual importance. They are the true seeds of character. We 
 might as well plant aGorns, and not expect them to grow, as 
 cherish small vices and not calculate on their increase ; or 
 as reasonably hope to see the firm and noble oak where no 
 acorns were ever planted, as true greatness and success in 
 life, where the seedlings of a thousand little habits of indus- 
 try and virtue had not been first carefully cherished. 

In a word, character is the sum of little things, rather 
 than great ones. The true estimate of an individual is not 
 ascertained by his accidental or occasional achievements, 
 but his every day habits. A nation's character is not deter- 
 mined by its famous men, but by the habits of its masses, 
 and the character of the age by the vices or virtues that 
 were so inherent as to be unnoticed. — Exchange. 

A Few Hints on Budding. 

A VALUABLE AND TIMELY ARTICLE. 

Budding, or inoculation, is one of the most general, .and, 
 in this country, by far the most important method of sum- 
 mer propagation. This operation consists in removing a 
 bud from the variety to be propagated, and inserting it on 
 another which is called the stock. Its success depends 
 upon the following conditions: — In the first place, there 
 must be a certain degree of affinity between the stock and 
 the parent plant from which we propose to propagate. Thus, 
 among fruit trees, the Apple, Crab, Pear, Quince, Mespilus, 
 and Mountain Ash, all belong to the same natural family, 
 and may be worked upon each other. The Plum, Apricot, 
 Nectarine, Peach and Almond, form another natural division, 
 and work upon each other. The Cherry must be worked 
 upon some kind of Cherry, and Currants and Gooseberries 
 go together. In general practice the Apple is worked 
 either upon Apple seedlings, which are called free stocks, 
 or upon the Doucain or Paradise, which are dwarf growing 
 species, and are used for the purpose of making small trees. 
 The Pear is worked either upon Pear seedlings, which are 
 called free stocks, or upon the Quince, to make dwarfs ; oc- 
 casionally it is worked upon the Mountain Ash and Thorn. 
 But it must be borne in mind that while all varieties succeed 
 on the Pear seedling, a certain number fail entirely on the 
 other stocks we have named. . The Cherry is worked either 
 upon seedlings of what is known as the Mazzard, a small, 
 black, sweet cherry, that form a very large, robust tree ; or 
 for dwarfs, on the Mahaleb, or perfumed cherry, which is a 
 small tree with bitter fruit, about as large as a common pea. 

In the second place, the buds must be in a proper state. 
 The shoot, or scion budded from, must be the present sea-
