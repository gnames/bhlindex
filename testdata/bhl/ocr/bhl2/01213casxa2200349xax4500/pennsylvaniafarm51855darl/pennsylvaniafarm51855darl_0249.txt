little greater than oats; that peas wheat and rye, produce 
 the greatest increase of wool; and that barley and wheat 
 cause the greatest increase of tallow. That, as an average, 
 grain generally gives about throo times the increase in the 
 flesh, that roots do when in equal weight; that grain pro- 
 duces about twice as much wool as is caused by an equal 
 weight of roots, aud several times the amount of tallow. 

The legitimate conclusion from the foregoing is, that the 
 flock'master, whose object is wool only, must rely on good 
 hay and some straw, whose constituents are admirably adapt- 
 ed for the growth and perfection of wool, with a moderate 
 allowance, daily, of ground peas and oats, and some pota- 
 toes as green food, for the greatest amount of wool; and 
 those gross substances, oil-cake 1 , corn-meal, ruta bagas, may 
 be turned oyer to the. producers of fat mutton. — Morrell's

Reaping and Mowing Exhibitions. 

The premium system, not only for Reaping and Mowing 
 Machines but for all other articles at our annual exhibitions, 
 although liable to many objections, is yet probably better 
 adapted than any thing else that can be devised to excite 
 general interest and promote competition. Knowing the 
 difficulties committees often labor under, we were pleased 
 that a few years ago a scale of points was adopted by the 
 State Agricultural Society of New York, for judging of live 
 stock. These were established after considerable delibera- 
 tion by many of her most prominent breeders; have given 
 since great satisfaction, and have been an important aid to 
 committees. It is now proposed by a number of prominent 
 friends of Agriculture in New York and Pennsylvania, to 
 establish a scale of points for Reapers and Mowers, and by 
 settling first what is wanted to make a perfect machine, to 
 afford thus some guide to committees at exhibitions, for 
 awarding premiums according to their approximation to a 
 recognized and established scale. 

We publish below the circular which has been issued. 
 Scales for Reapers and Mowers. 

Remarks upon the Scale: — A Scale of Points is neces- 
 sary in Trials of Reapers and Mowers for three reasons : 1st, 
 that a correct decision may be obtained; 2nd, that the 
 grounds of the awards may be understood by those who 
 wish to buy machines; and 3rd, that the awards of different 
 committees may be understandingly compared. 

It is idle for any committee, no matter how capable of 
 judging clearly and correctly, to jump at a decision in the 
 aggregate between the claims of rival Reapers — so many of 
 which are established as good machines, some of them per- 
 haps nearly equal in all important respects, and no one of 
 which is best on every point. A comparison must be insti- 
 tuted between them, and a careful decision had, upon each 
 specific point. Having a scale of these various points, with 
 their relative value fairly apportioned, even an inferior com- 
 mittee could hardly fail to arrive at a pretty correct 
 award. 

Such has been tho character of most of the trials that the 
 decisions have little weight. The premiums at one trial are 
 given to certain machines, and in the adjoining County or 
 State, the verdict is reversed and other machines declared 
 best. None of the details upon which judgment was formed, 
 being known, it is impossible for a farmer not at the trials 
 to get any aid from them in selecting a Reaper. Indeed, 
 the variety of verdicts given in this blind manner, tends to 
 confuse him; whereas had the decisions been given upon 
 each specific point, he could by comparison of the reports, 
 decide which Reaper was best suited to his circumstances. 

One scale was prepared of 100, but to give the points 
 lowest in importance a sufficiently high number to mark the 

relative differences in machines, the sum total must run far 
 beyond that amount. 

It is important for farmers to have such machines used in 
 trials, as are ordjnarily built and sold to them. They do 
 not want to be misled by a machine of extra cost and finish, 
 taking the highest prize. They want to see the machines 
 tried that they have got to buy. Therefore, let all societies 
 introduce a rule to this effect, and if any manufacturer is 
 found trying to work underhandedly or unfairly on this or 
 other points, he should be excluded from the trial and the 
 award, at the judgment of the committee. 

The above scales are not offered to the public as being 
 perfect, but as being an improvement upon any plan as yet 
 proposed. It has received the careful consideration of far- 
 mers well acquainted with machines, and with public trials, 
 and has been altered so that it meets the united approval of 
 leading persons in the agricultural societies of five different 
 States. 

It is hoped it will be generally used this year in trials, 
 and that committees and others interested will send reports 
 of their decisions, and communicate their views and any al- 
 terations they may suggest, to Col. B. P. Johnson, Secre- 
 retary, State Agricultural Society, Albany, N. Y., and to 
 Dr. A. L. Elwyn, Secretary, State Agricultural Society, 
 Philadelphia, Pa. 

Note.— Judgment being formed by the Committee relative to each' 
 machine ou each specific point according to the following scales, the 
 machine whose aggregate reaches the highest No. is the victor; 300 
 being the sum total of a perfect Reaper, 212 of a perfect Mower, and 
 550 of a perfect combined machine.

 -To determine the relative value of points correctly, they 
 should, as far ar practicable, be estimated by dollars and 
 cents, though several cannot be arrived at in that manner. 
 As a matter of convenience, those are put into the scale that 
 can bo estimated by money, at a unit for each dollar. 

1st Pointy "Cost." — This I get at by supposing a machine 
 good for five years wear, which the higher priced ones cer- 
 tainty are — tho difference in price between the cheapest and 
 the highest priced is $35. This amount divided among the 
 five years, gives $7, and the interest on $35 is $2.10, making 
 $9.10. This, therefore, is put at' 9, in the scale, being a unit 
 for each dollar. 

The 2d Point should road, "simplicity of construction to 
 do its work. The more a machine does, the more machinery 
 may there be to do it. A Self Raknr, and even a Binder, may 
 be just as simple in its structure, as some Hand Raker, con- 
 sidering what it does; and to make judgment fair and equi-
