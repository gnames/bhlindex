table between them, the object and work must be fairly con- 
 sidered as well as construction. 

This point is not of great importance — those following 
 should control. For if a machine is easily managed, dura- 
 ble, 4c, it is little matter about a piece or two more of gear- 
 ing or frame. 

The 3d Point — "Facility of management, including time 
 and room required for turning," is so similar to the ninth 
 points — rapidity of operation, that one of these must be set 
 low, or too much weight will be given them. 

The ith Point — "Durability and Reliability," is of much 
 more importance. Any machine, however good in other re- 
 spects, in an immense evil to the farmer, if it fails in time of 
 need. Having relied upon it to save his grain, and it proving 
 worthless, and having made no other provisions, he is 
 obliged to hire harvesters at largely increased cost, if indeed 
 he can get them at all, or perhaps submit to the loss of a 
 valuable crop, wholly or in part. Opinions would vary 
 greatly as to the number this should be set at. 

The 5th Point — "Adaptation to varied and uneven surfa- 
 ces, and to cutting at different heights," should be set much 
 lower than the previous one. 

The- 6th Point — "Freedom of the knife from clogging," 
 seems to merit much consideration ; though not so impor- 
 tant in reaping as in mowing. Some machines, it is known, 
 choke or clog by fibres being drawn in the opening of the 
 fingers in cutting damp or wet grain. This is particularly 
 the case where there is>uiuck undergrowth. It is important 
 to be able to put when the dew is on, because it is cooler, 
 and the grain shatters less. But if the knife constantly 
 clogs, little progress can be made. 

tK3= Thus far it has been impossible to find data by which to estimate 
 the relative value of the points, and opinions will perhaps vary very 
 much concerning them. But in the others, we can get sound data to 
 base them upon, and though in carrying out the estimates some com e 
 to high figures, they are not therefore to beiejected or considered 
 wild. 

The 7th Point — "Motive power, or power required for a 
 given amount of work." The difference in team required 
 to work any two Reapers, is never more than one pair of 
 horses, — the value of which for a harvest will vary consid- 
 erably in different sections. Large farmers who have plenty 
 of horses would only consider the cost of an extra pair as 
 the worth of the extra grain they had to feed during the 
 reaping. Probably putting this at the same as the 1st point, 
 ' cost," will be fair and certainly high enough, particularly 
 as the inconvenience of using an extrapair has its weight 
 in the estimate of 3d point. 

The Sth Point — "Manual labor in Raking." To establish 
 the value of this point, it is first to bo considered that there 
 is considerable difference between hand-raking Reapers in 
 the ease with which grain can be raked from them. It 
 would not be too much to allow 10 to estimate the. difference 
 between them. 

Then a Self -Raker saves a hand, — and that too, at the 
 very hardest of work — over the best hand Rakor. As wages 
 were last year, and will bo the present, this hand in harvest 
 with his board costs at least $2.00 a day. If a little less 
 than that in some sections, it will be enough more in others 
 to make it equal this and more too. The wheat harvest will 
 last from 8 to 12 days — say 10 — and oats, rye, barley, Ac, 
 say 5 days. The latter is perhaps a day or two longer than 
 southern farmers would generally have grain for, but it is 
 too little by 5 days for the North, so that 15 days work 
 would be a moderate allowance, making .the saving $30. 
 Something more should be added to this, because of the ex- 
 cessive labor that is saved, one hand being hardly sufficient 
 to work all day long, and day after day in raking off. For 
 this 5 is added. Add tho previous 10, giving 45 for this point. 

The %th Point — "Rapidity, or amount of harvesting in a 
 given time." Suppose Reapers cost on an average with 
 transportation, $140, and are worn out in 5 years,- that is 
 $28 a year; the interest is $8.40. The team, 2 pair, $18. 
 The Rake' $30, and driver $20. The lattor not having as 
 hard work and a cheaper hand answering, his labor is esti- 
 mated a little less than the raker. The total is $104.40. 
 The narrowest Reaper cuts 4£ feet, and the widest 6 feet, 
 (with a very few exceptions not necessary to be allowed for,) 
 making a difference of one quarter. Then one quarter of the 
 above figures would give tho value of this point at 26. 

The 10th Point — "Manner of leaving the grain for bind- 
 ing." More difference than one hand can bo made in bind- 
 ing, by the gavels being well or badly laid. Between the 
 best and worst machine to rake from, there is in the manner 
 of depositing the grain, at least a difference of a hand and 
 a half, costing for the 15 days $45, making this point there- 
 fore 45. 

The 11th Point — "Saving of grain in cutting, binding, 
 and handling, and in the stack." Those who have compared 
 tho working of different Reapers, know that some will save 
 largely as compared With others, and it is very easy to make 
 a difference of several bushels in each day's work of 10 to 
 15 acres, even to the amount of a bushel or more an acre, 
 particularly if the grain is over ripe. 

There is, 1st, the loss in not cutting clean; 2d, shattering 
 by the reel and in cutting; 3d, shattering in raking off; 4th, 
 loss from scattered grain being badly rnked off; 5th, loss in 
 handling the sheaves, the grain not having been raked 
 straight, and consequently being imperfectly secured in the 
 sheaf; and 0th, liability to injury in the stack by the weather 
 if the heads are not all laid ono way in the raking. 

These losses, though depending much upon the hands, 
 will all be found to exist, and greatly to vary between diff- 
 erent machines with good hands. Some of them are trifling, 
 yet in the aggregate they make a point of much more value 
 than any other. 

Suppose the difference of loss in extreme cases is only 
 half a bushel to the acre, — that 120 acres of wheat and 60 
 acres of other grains are cut, which would bo twelve acres 
 per day for the season of 15 days. Thus there is saved 60 
 bushels of wheat, worth say $1 per bushel, and 30 bushels 
 of oats, barley, rye, <fcc, worth say 40 cents, making the 
 saving $72. Though 72 seems at first to be large for this 
 point, it ought to be set higher rather than lower. 

If this scale is at all correct, there is, of course, great 
 difference in machines. If tho 40 or 50 varieties invented, 
 and of which some 30 are more or less in use, could all be 
 brought together, some would run very low in the scale, 
 while others would go high. Of the points in the scale 206 
 (loss 10 in tho 8th point of raking) equal 196, are estimated 
 in money value of say only $14 a season, making $210. 
 Some of the reapers would not in thorough trials reach 60 
 on these points, while qthers would reach 160 and over, thus 
 showing there may be a differenc in reapers of over $.100 in 
 a single season's use. 

With so large a difference in reapers, and the demand so 
 rapidly increasing, and it being difficult — almost impossible, 
 for farmers to compare them themselves, it is not strange 
 that so many attempts should bo made to test them by far- 
 mers united in their State and County societies. Yet how 
 few of the numerous trials have as yet resulted in any per- 
 manent good ! Wherefore this abortive result in efforts 
 which havo cost so much in time, labor and money to socie- 
 ties, committees, reaper-builders .and the public generally ? 
 Is not the failure chiefly owing to the want of a systematic 
 plan to insure thoroughness and guard against mistakes ? If 
 so, a good scalo of this kind will correct the evils, and it is
