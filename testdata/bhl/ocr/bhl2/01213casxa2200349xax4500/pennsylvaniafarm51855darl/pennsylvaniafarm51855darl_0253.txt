them, is the smoothness of their inner surface. Any one 
 who has paid attention to the rooting of plants in pots, must 
 be aware that many kinds delight to root amongst the bro- 
 ken erockage, and about any irregularity of surface in the 
 pot: this would appear to have some assimilation with the 
 fissures of rocks, in which it is known that some kinds de- 
 light to root ; and, if this be the case, the smooth glazed pots, 
 and the absence of all erockage .might render them still less 
 valuable. The great objection, however, to glazed pots, is 
 the simple fact that they are not porous. In the culture of 
 plants in pots, the porosity of the sides of the latter will 
 permit the atmospheric air, composed of vital gases, to pen- 
 etrate through into the soil, and thus the healthiest roots are 
 always found in contact with the pot; but iu the case of 
 glazed pots, this percolation could not take place, and the 
 surface of the soil alone would be exposed in any degree to 
 the action of the atmosphere ; consequently the plants would 
 "be deprived of a greator portion of their nourishment.- Flor.

Of the Manures from Domestic Animals and their Pre- 
 servation. 

The manure of various domestic animals is, in this coun- 
 try, most commonly employed as a fertilizer, all other 
 manures being used in comparatively small quantities ; and 
 yet even these are seldom preserved and applied as carefully 
 as they might, or ought to be. 

The principal varieties are those of the ox, the cow, the 
 hog, the horse, and the sheep. Of these, that of the horse 
 is most valuable in its fresh state: it contains much nitrogen, 
 but is very liable to lose by fermentation. That of the hog 
 comes next. That of the cow is placed at the bottom of the 
 list. This is because the enriching substances of her food go 
 principally ta the formation of milk, the manure being 
 thereby rendered poorer. 

The manure of all these animals is far richer than the 
 food given them because it contains much more nitrogen. 
 This is for the reason that a large part of the carbon and 
 oxygen of the food are consumed in the lungs and blood 
 generally; for the purpose of keeping up the "heat of the 
 body. They are given off from the lungs, and also by per- 
 spiration and evaporation through the pores of the skin, in 
 the forms of carbonic acid and water. 

From animals fed upon rich food, the manure is much 
 more powerful than when it is poor. In England, for in- 
 stance, where they fatten cattle largely on oil-cake, it is 
 calculated that the increased value of the manure repays 
 all of the outlay. This is the reason why human ordure is 
 better than manure from any of the animals mentioned 
 above, the food of man being rich and various. 

All these kinds of manure should be carefully collected 
 and preserved, both as to their liquid and solid parts. The 
 liquid part or urine is particularly rich in the phosphates 
 and in. nitrogen. This part is by very many farmers per- 
 mitted in a great degree to run away or evaporate. Some 
 farmyards are contrived so as to throw the water off entire- 
 ly, others convey it through a small ditch upon the nearest 
 field. The liquid manure which might have fertilized 
 several acres in the course of the season, is thus concen- 
 trated upon one Small spot, and the consequence is a vegeta- 
 tion so rank as to be of very littlo use. Spots of this kind 
 may be seen in the neighborhood of many farm-yards, 
 where the grass grows up so heavy that it falls down and 
 rots at the bottom, and has to be cut some weeks before 
 having time, producing strong coarse hay that cattle will 
 scarcely touch. 

The proper way to save this liquid is to have a tank or 
 hole, into which all the drainings of the yard may be con- 

ducted. If left here long, this liquid begins to ferment, and 
 to lose nitrogen in the form of ammonia, which it will be 
 remembered is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen. To 
 remedy this, a little sulphuric acid, or a few pounds of 
 plaster, may be occasionally thrown in. The sulphurie acid 
 will unite with the ammonia, and form sulphate of ammonia, 
 which will remain unchanged, not being liable to evaporate. 
 Others prefer to mix sufficient peat, ashes, sawdust, or fino 
 charcoal, with the liquid in tank, to soak it all up ; others 
 still pump it out and pour it upon a compost heap. One 
 point is to be noticed in the management of a tank. Only 
 the water which naturally drains from the stables and yards 
 should be allowed to enter it: all that falls from the eaves 
 of the buildings should bo discharged elsewhere. Regu- 
 lated in this way, the tank will seldom overflow, and the 
 manure collected in it will be of the most valuable and 
 powerful description. The tank may be made of stone, 
 brick, or wood, as is most convenient, and need cost but 
 very little. 

While the liquid manure is actually in many cases al- 
 most entirely lost, the solid part is often allowed to drain 
 and bleach, until nearly every thing soluble has washed 
 away ; or is exposed in heaps to ferment, without any 
 covering. In such a case ammonia is always formed and 
 given off: it may often be perceived by the smell, particu- 
 larly in horse manure. The fact may also be shown, by 
 dipping a feather in muriatic acid and waving it over the 
 heap. If ammonia in any quantity is escaping, white fumes 
 will be visible about the feather, caused by the formation of 
 muriate of ammonia. A teacher can exemplify this by 
 holding a feather, dipped in the same way, over an 
 ammonia bottle. This escape of so valuable a substance 
 may be in a great measure prevented by shovelling earth 
 over the surface of the heap, to a depth of two or three 
 inches. If this does not arrest it entirely, sprinkle a few 
 haudfuls of plaster upon the top : the sulphuric acid of the 
 plaster will as before unite with the ammonia, and form 
 sulphate of ammonia. 

Manures containing nitrogen in large quantity are so ex- 
 ceedingly valuable, because this gas is required to form 
 gluten, and bodies of that class, in the plant; this is parti- 
 cularly in the seed, and sometimes also in the fruit. Plants 
 can easily obtain an abundance of carbon, oxygen, and 
 hydrogen, from the air, the soil, and manures. Not so with 
 nitrogen. They cannot get it from the air : there is little of 
 it in most soils; and hence manures which contain much of 
 it, produce such a marked effect. Not that it is more ne- 
 cessary than the other organic bodies, but more scarce ; at 
 least in a form available for plants. The same reasoning 
 applies to phosphoric acid. It is not more necessary 
 than the other inorganic ingredients ; but still is more 
 valuable, because more uncommon in the soil and in 
 manures. 

In all places where manure is protected from the sun, 
 and from much washing by rain, its value is greatly in- 
 creased. 

a. Horse manure particularly should not be left exposed 
 at all: it begins to heat and to lose nitrogen almost immedi- 
 ately, as may be perceived by the smell. It should be 
 mixed with other manures, or covered by some absorbent 
 earth, as soon as possible. Almost every one who enters a 
 stable in the morning, where there are many horses, must 
 perceive the strong smell of ammonia that fills the place. 
 I have seen in some stables, little pans containing plaster of 
 of Paris or sulphuric acid, for the purpose of absorbing these 
 fumes, and forming sulphate of ammonia, b. The liquid 
 which runs from barnyards and from manure heaps, is 
 shown by analysis to consist of the most fertilizing sub-
