stances ; and it is calculated that where this is all allowed 
 to wash away, as is the case in many instances, the manure 
 is often reduced nearly one-half in its value. I have seen 
 yards where it was almost worthless, owing to long ex- 
 posure. 

The farmers of this country need awakening upon the 
 subject "f carefully preserving their common manures. In 
 Flanders, where everything of the kind is saved with tho 
 greatest care, the liquid manure of a single cow for a 
 year is valued at $10 ; here it is too often allowed to escape 
 entirely. Either they are very foolish, or we are very 
 wasteful. 

Truths Established by Agricultural Chemistry. 
 Liebig. 
 If the deficient ingredient be added to the soil, or an in- 
 soluble one be made soluble, the others become effective. I same be destined to yield anew a like number of crops 

not be increased by addition of atmospheric ingredients. 

By incorporating with a soil rich in mineral nutritive 
 matters, either ammonia alone or ammonia humus, one 
 heavy crop, or a series of the same, may be gathered with- 
 out any replacement of the removed soil ingredients. Tho 
 duration of productiveness in such a case depends upon the 
 store, the quantity and form of the mineral plant- food con- 
 tained in the soil. Continuing such a course must in time 
 exhaust the soil. 

If a soil thus reduced is to be brought up to its original 
 fertility, the soil ingredients that have been removed during 
 the period in which it was subjected to the exhausting pro- 
 cess, must be restored. 

If in ten years the soil has yielded ten crops without res- 
 titution of the removod soil-ingredients, then in tho 11th 
 year this tenfold quantity must be replaced in the soil, if tho 

The deficiency of one ingredient, makes a soil unproductive 
 of all those plants which indispensably require this ingredi- 
 ent, although all others be present. The soil yields 
 abundant crops when this ingredient is added in proper 
 quantity and form. In cases of soils of unknown composi- 

The foregoing fifty propositions are comprehended in a sin- 
 gle one, viz., that the nourishment, growth and developement 
 of plants, depend upon the absorption of certain matters, which 
 of themselves, or by virtue of their mass, produce an effect. 
 This effect, within certain limits therefore, stands in direct ratio

 learning the nature and deficiencies of the soil. If e. g. j their action. If this proposition, whose truth can he subject

 the same was deficient in the soil, while all other ingredients J ducible, by subsisting the words poor or rich, fruitful or 

were present therein in sufficient quantity. If any other 
 necessary substance had been wanting, then the phosphate 
 of lime would have manifested no action. 

The action of all the soil-constituents collectively is de- 
 pendent upon the simultaneous co-operation of the atmos- 
 pheric plant food. 

The efficacy of the atmospheric plant-food depends upon 
 the joint-working of the soil-ingredients at the same time. 
 When the soil contains the proper ingredients, in proper 
 quantity and form, the development of a plant stands in ra- 
 tio to the amount of atmospheric plant-food offered to and 
 assimilated by the plant. The quantity and condition (state 
 of solubility or absorbability) of the mineral nutritive matters 
 in the soil, and the absence or presence of hindrances to 
 their activity, (physical character or condition), increase or 
 diminish the number and mass of plants that may be culti- 
 vated on a given surface. The fruitful soil removes, in the 
 vegetation it supports, more carbonic acid and ammonia from 
 the atmosphere than one that is unfruitful. 

This removal is in ratio to the fertility of the soil, and is 
 only limited by the limited amount of carbonic acid and am- 
 monia present in the air. 

By like supply of the atmospheric conditions of vegetable 
 growth, the harvest stands in direct ratio to the mineral 
 plant-food added in the manure. 

By telluric conditions, the harvests are in proportion to the 
 quantity of atmospheric plant-food furnished by the atmos- 
 phere and by the soil. 

If carbonic acid and ammonia be added to the supplies 
 already in the soil, its productiveness is increased. 

The union of the telluric and atmospheric conditions, and 
 their co-operation in proper quantity and form, and at the 
 right time, determine the maximum of production. 

The addition of a larger quantity of atmospheric plant- 
 food (by means of humus, salts of ammonia, <fcc.,) than the 
 atmosphere offers, increases tho activity of the mineral sub- 
 stances present. In such a case the yield of a given surface 
 would be greater. It might happen that thus in one year 
 as much would be produced as otherwise in two years. 

The produce of a soil rich in mineral plant-food, cannot be 
 increased by addition of mineral substances. 

The produce of afield rich in atmospheric plant-food, can 

unfruitful, for the relations of quantity of the nutrilive mat- 
 ters ; and their action the terms fruitfulness, yield, crop <fec. 
 Whoever will take the trouble to read through my Chemi- 
 stry in its Application to Agriculture and Physiology, with 
 moderate care, will easily find therein all these propositions, 
 No. 14 excepted, and this I shall subsequently notice. 

As regard the truths of these views, it is known that from 
 time out of mind, the action of animal excrements, and of 
 vegetable and animal refuse, has been recognized. The 
 first observations on the effect of ammonia, were made as I 
 believe by H. Davy. 

Tho investigation of the processes of peutrefaction and de- 
 cay (vide my article in Annalen d. Chemie u. Phys. Bd. 
 XXX $250, 1839), as also the discovery of the constant occur- 
 rence of ammonia in the air and in rain water, led me to con- 
 sider that nature has provided not several but one .single ni- 
 trogen containing substance as food to plants; that ammonia 
 is the only nitrogenous body known that nature offers for 
 this purpose, and that all other nitrogenous substances act 
 only so far as they aie capable of supplying ammonia by 
 their decomposition. 

That humus, in presence of moisture and air, is a source 
 of carbonic acid, was long sinced proved by Dr Saussure. 
 Strange to say, that philosopher, even to his latest days, 
 denied the action of humus as a source of carbonic acid, and 
 sought to sustain tho so-called humus-theory, (Ann. d. 
 Cheni. u. Ph. Bd. 42, $275.) 

To tho action of humus as a source of carbonic acid, as a 
 solvent for tho phosphate of lime and of the alkaline earths, 
 I have first directed attention, in my Familiar Letters on 
 Chemistry, (London ed., 1851. p. 502, note.) Afterwards 
 (1852) Boussingaui.t occupied himself with determining 
 the amount of carbonic acid in the air enclosed in the soil, 
 and found that in freshly dunged soils the quantity is often 
 400 times greater than in tho atmosphere. 

The solubility of tho phosphate of lime in sulphate of 
 ammonia, I have mentioned on page 502 of Familiar Let- 
 ters on Chemistry, Eng. ed. 

Several years later, Kuhlman (Comptes Rendus, XVII. 
 p. 1118â€”1130) remarked as follows : 

"In order to understand fully tho action of the salts of 
 ammonia, it is necessary to point out tho fact that they
