able to support himself and family, keeping two cows and 
 annually raising several head of cattle; and he has acquired 
 enough to enable him to enlarge his buildings, and all this 
 without ammonia or humus, and only by help of mineral 
 manures. On the effect of these fertilizers in 1853, a farmer 
 of the vicinity [Aubel of Wiseck] wrote me as follows : ''The 
 yield of rye with us is very small; on the Heights [the little 
 farm is known in Giessen by the name of Liebig's Heights] 
 they have harvested 12 simmer of rye from 3 fuder [ten and 
 three-fifth bushels from ISO sheaves.] From 3 fuder of the 
 best rye I have only had 5 simmer [4J bu.] If you should 
 see it you would be astonished; it is indeed remarkable." 

After the lapse of about four years, the mineral matters 
 incorporated with the soil, came gradually- into activity, and 
 it is to be foreseen that this field will retain its fertility, if 
 there be yearly returned to it as much soil-ingredients as are 
 removed in the crops. 

The effect of individual substances could be clearly traced, 
 and tv;is manifested in many cases in a truly wonderful man- 
 ner. A deficiency or excess of phosphate of lime, of alka- 
 lies for root crops, of alkaline-earths for clover, of alkali- 
 silicates for the cereals, was plainly revealed in the growth 
 of these plants. The trial plots appeared like the writing 
 on the leaves of a book; their significance was evident even 
 to the uninitiated. 

I have every reason to believe that the organic refuse of 
 the crops that remained in the field, in consequence of the 
 action of the carbonic acid, resulting from its decay, made 
 available mineral plant-food, which had previously been un- 
 attainable to vegetation. 

Since the present owner came into possession, the stable 
 manure and all the animal excrements produced on the 
 premises, and especially the urine, have been collected with 
 the greatest care, and of course have been incorporated with 
 the soil. This piece of land acted as an actual condensor of 
 carbon and nitrogen in the vegetation it produced, and I 
 consider myself perfectly authorized in concluding, from my 
 experiments, that, in ordinary farm management, presup- 
 posed that the composition and character of the soil is right, 
 such a quantity of ammonia will gradually accumulate in 
 the soil as, considered in relation to the previously present 
 soil-ingredients, will be more than sufiicient to give them 
 their maximum of efficacy. This does not of course imply 
 that by further addition of mineral and atmospheric plant- 
 food, a far greater yield may not be obtained. 

My experiments, which occasioned me an outlay of 8,000 
 florins, (S3, 200, the difference between the entire expendi- 
 ture and the sale-price,) show indeed that to make a soil 
 fertile which is barren from want of active (soluble) ingredi- 
 ents, and not on account of its unfavorable physical condi- 
 tion, requires an outlay greater than the purchase of the 
 most fruitful soil; but in this I was in no way disappointed. 
 What I wished to arrive at was well worth the sacrifice. 
 What I have arrived at, is the firm conviction that the time 
 must come when agriculture will be carried on, as an art, 
 according to scientific principles, and not according to mere 
 recipes. 

Guano. 

A gentleman of Wilmington, Delaware, has given us the 
 following account of the use of guano, under his own direc- 
 tion, as well as the experience of others, in the State of 
 Delaware, which will be valuable to those who are desirous 
 of experimenting with this fertilizer. No experiments can 
 be Satisfactory but those made with the genuine Guano. The 
 gentlemen in Delaware are particular in securing the true 
 article, and reliance therefore is to be placed upon their 
 statements. 

" I have postponed answering your queries with regard to 
 guano, in order to submit them to some of the best farmers 
 of this neighborhood, whom I was to meet yesterday. The 
 general result of their answers is that the effect of guano is 
 in inverse ratio to the richness of the soil. On the rich 
 farms of Chester county, Pennsylvania, guano has not been 
 much tried, as they have no need of it, and when tried, gave 
 unsatisfactory results. On the contrary, on the naturally 
 fertile land, but exhausted by injudicious cultivation, of our 
 lower counties, it has produced very good and durable 
 effects. Mr. Bryan Jackson, an intelligent agriculturist and 
 practical farmer, informs me that an application of 300 
 pounds guano per acre produced on his place a crop of 
 wheat equal to the one grown on the same land with seven- 
 teen cart loads of barn yard manure. He had the ground 
 plowed deep previously to spreading the guano, and had it 
 covered by another shallow plowing. He states that he ob- 
 tained no results of guano for oats or barley. However one 
 of my neighbors gets good crops of oats on poor land in 
 which he plows guano. I was also informed that a crop of 
 corn of 70 bushels to the acre had been obtained on poor 
 laud from a mixture of guano and plaster, at the rate of a. 
 handful in each hill, put in before dropping the seed. This 
 is only an hearsay. My own experience with this manure 
 dates from ten or eleven years ago, when I tried it for wheat 
 with very good results, and I obtained the best wheat where 
 the most guano had been laid on. The next year, having a 
 new grass field that' had given a very short crop at the first 
 cutting, I applied on twelve acres of it a top-dressing of one 
 ton of Ichaboo guano, mixed with equal bulk of plaster. 
 The result was, for the following year, a crop of upwards of 
 two tons of hay to the acre on the twelve acres which had 
 been top dressed, while it vVas quite light on the part 
 that had received nothing. Having top dressed the 
 remainder of the field in the same way, it became quite 
 equal to the first part. I have had that field mowed or 
 pastured six years before it was necessary to plow it again. 
 Since then I am so satisfied with this fertilizer's efficacy 
 that I do not experiment upon it. I use it in conjunction 
 with stable manure, plowing it down, except for rutabaga 
 and other turnips, for which I cover it with a slight har- 
 rowing, and also for top-dressing wheat stubble at the 
 rate of 300 pounds per acre mixed with equal bulk of plas- 
 ter. For this operation I wait rainy weather, in order to 
 have the guano immediately washed in the ground. It is, 
 however, desirable to have it performed early, in order to 
 let the clover and other grass get strong enough to withstand 
 the pernicious influence of winter. 

"On the whole I think guano in most invaluable on ex- 
 hausted soils to produce straw, fodders, &c, or to enable the 
 farmer to increase his manure, but that when applied ex- 
 clusively to the production of grain, without combining with 
 it stable manure or green crops, as I believe is done in some 
 parts of the country, it will utimatoly leave the lands in a 
 worse state of exhaustion than ever. 

" The hay crop here will be short. The severity of last 
 winter: after, the drouth of tho autumn, has been very hard 
 on it, and the spring rains have come too late to restore it. 
 Wheat has been much winter killed, but has improved in 
 the spring." â€” Journal N. Y. State Ag. Society. 

Packing Buds and Grafts. 

We have on former occasions given directions on this 
 subject, but have observed among the packages of grafts oc- 
 casionly reeoived, indications that the best modes are not 
 well understood, even by some intelligent cultivators of 
 fine fruit, by whom errors are often committed.
