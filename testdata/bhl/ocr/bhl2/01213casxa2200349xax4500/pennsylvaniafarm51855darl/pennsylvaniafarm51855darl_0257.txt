and grafts by mail has become a great convenience to fruit 
 raisers and pomologists, and the only difficulty is to put 
 them up so that they shall carry long distances with safety. 
 The essential requisites, are to secure the moisture they con- 
 tain from evaporation, and to prevent bruising. 

To prevent evaporation, it was formeily the custom to en- 
 case them in muslin covered with a coating of grafting 
 wax ; but this was found inconvenient to apply and trouble- 
 some in removal. The writer therefore introduced an im- 
 provement some fifteen years since, which has since been 
 generally adopted throughout the country. This is to wrap 
 the grafts in oil-silk, selecting a piece large enough to cover 
 them and to bend it up over the ends, so as to bring it down 
 air-tight-mi every part, by winding a fine thread around it 
 at very short intervals from end to end. This forms a com- 
 plete air-tight case, through which the moisture from the 
 graft or buds cannot escape ; and if well put up, grafts may 
 be sent in this way across the Atlantic without the slightest 
 risk. Buds in summer, being greener and more succulent, 
 and the temperature being warmer, cannot be forwarded to 
 such great distances. Peach buds, and other kinds cut be- 
 fore the wood is well ripened and hardened, should not re-, 
 main in this condition longer than three or four days ; 
 but well ripened shoots of the pear and apple, near the close 
 of the season of growth, will continue uninjured for at least 
 a fortnight. 

To prevent bruising during the period of conveyance, 
 cotton batting, or several thicknesses of soft paper, should 
 be placed outside the oil-silk wrapper. A pomological 
 friend, to whom we gave instructions some years since in 
 sending grafts, took the especial precaution of applying a 
 coating of cotton batting first to the grafts, and then en- 
 cased them in oil-cloth. The consequence was that the dry 
 cotton in immediate contact, absorbed the moisture from the 
 grafts, and on their arrival they were found as dry as if ex- 
 posed to a summer sun. In another instance, several 
 thicknesses of soft paper were used for a similar purpose, 
 and with a like result. For this reason, even the strip of 
 paper containing the name, should be as small as possible ; 
 and it is still better to write it with a finely pointed soft 
 pencil on a shaved portion of the scion — or to cut notches 
 as reference-numbers. 

When large quantities of scions are sent by " Express," a 
 different mode of packing is to be adopted. We have some- 
 times received them withered and dried, without anything 
 to preserve their moisture ; and in one instance a bundle of 
 grafts was sent with the leaves left on to keep them moist, but 
 instead of producing this result, the leaves had operated as 
 evaporators (as they always do,) and had pumped all the 
 moisture out of the grafts, through the leaf-stalks, and they 
 were thoroughly seasoned when they came to hand. The 
 leaves should always be removed, and the grafts packed in 
 alternate layers with fine damp moss, and with a good moss- 
 coating outside. Damp sawdust is a good substitute for moss, 
 for packages of moderate size. The packing should not be 
 wet, as in this case it will cause the scions to become water- 
 soaked and tend to induce decay. Buds at mid-summer 
 may be put up in this way, and will keep without injury 
 from three days to a week or more according to the degree 
 of maturity which the wood has obtained. — Country Gen-

 We desire to correct a statement that has been published 
 in the papers, that several of this fine herd of imported 
 cattle had been stolen and butchered. The report originat- 
 ed from the loss of some fine cattle belonging to another 
 gentleman of the same name, residing in the same town. 

We were at Fordham on our way to the trial of Mowers at 
 Bedford, and saw the whole of tho herd, and the animals 
 were never in finer health and condition than they are at 
 present. " The Duke of Gloster" is in prime order, and 
 " Duchess 66th" and " Bloom" are in capital condition. 
 The Duchess, served by Duke of Gloster, will drop her calf 
 in July. — Journal N. Y. State Ag. Society.

Mr. Smith Lounges on the Sofa. 
 And Mrs. Smith Lectures him for it. 

[There is a touch of practical good sense about the fol- 
 lowing that will be appreciated by thousands. We find it it 
 it in the Marysville Tribune :] 

'• I declare, Mr. Smith ! this is too bad. Hero you are 
 stretched out on the sofa, mussing it up, and my nice carpet 
 is all spoiled by the tramp of your coarse boots. I shall be 
 ashamed to bring any one into the parlor again — and I have 
 taken so much pains to keep everything nice ! I do think, 
 Mr. Smith, you are tho most thoughtless man I ever did see — 
 you don't appear to care how much trouble youjgive me. It 
 I had no more care than you have we would soon have a nice 
 looking house — it would not be long till our new house and 
 furniture would be just as bad as the old," said John Smith's 
 wife to him, as she saw him in the parlor taking a nap on 
 the sofa. 

Mr. Smith rose up slowly, and answered, " I was tired and 
 sleepy, Mary, and the weather so hot, and this room so quiet 
 and cool, and the sofa looked so inviting, that I could not 
 resist the temptation to snooze a little. I thought when we 
 were building a new house, and furnishing it thus, that we 
 were doing it because the old house and furniture wore not 
 so comfortable and desirable, and that I and my own dear 
 Mary, would indulge ourselves in a little quiet leisure in 
 these nice rooms, and if we chose, in lounging on the 
 sofas and rocking in these cushioned arm chairs, away 
 from the noise of the family, and the smell of the cooking 
 stove. 

" I did not dream of displeasing you, Mary, and I thought 
 it would give you pleasure to see me enjoying a nap on the 
 sofa, this warm afternoon. I notice when Merchant Swell, 
 or Col. Bigman, and their families are here, you appear de- 
 lighted to have sofas, and cushioned arm chairs for them to 
 sit in or lounge upon. I thought the house and the sofas 
 were to use — that we were seeking our own pleasure when 
 we paid a large sum of money for them ; but I suppose I 
 was mistaken, and that the house and furniture are for 
 strangers, and that we are to sit in tho old kitchen, and if I 
 want to take a nap, or rest a little when fatigued, I am 
 to lie down on a slab in the wood house ; and if you 
 want to rest, can go to the children's trundle bed, in the 
 little close bed room where the flies can have a chance at 
 you." 

The irony of Mr. Smith's reply only provoked his wife, 
 and seeing himself threatened with a repetition of Mrs. 
 Smith's speech, with unpleasant additions and variations, 
 and knowing that he would get tired of gaining victories 
 over her in argument, before she would think of getting 
 tired of defeat, he took himself out, and left Mrs. Smith to 
 fix up and dust out, and lock him out of his own house, and 
 took a seat on an old chair in the kitchen, which Mrs. Smith 
 said was good enough to use every clay — in the kitchen 
 where no one sees it. 

Poor mistaken Mrs. Smith, thought I. And yet most 
 women aro like her. They want a fine house, and when 
 they get it they want an out house built to live in, and they 
 confine their families to a few small rooms, poorly furnished, 
 while the main room, well furnished, is never seen by the 
 family only when visitors come ! Both house and furniture
