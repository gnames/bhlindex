plan a suitable line of action, and set Lis men to work 
 in the gathering together of materials. On the other 
 hand, the man who has method and energy both in 
 planning farm-work and getting it performed, seizes 
 every spare hour and minute to accomplish the end he 
 has in view. The work is laid out systematically for 
 each man, and if it is completed before the hour of 
 cessation from labour, and should he have a cart with 
 him, he must fill it with some sort of road scrapings, or 
 earth, and bring it to the compost heap ; or, if he have 
 only a spade, he must gather a heap or two of such sub- 
 stances together, wherever he can get them. Far 
 better, surely, to do this, than to have men wandering 
 several field's-breadth to ask more work ; or, just as 
 bad, making the work serve the time at their command, 
 in case they have to do so. 

Then, again, in wet days, when a bad manager allows 
 his men to loiter away within doors the short intervals 
 between showers, the person who knows the value of 
 time and the best means of improving it has them at 
 work whenever it is dry over-head. It will even gene- 
 rally pay to have a sort of temporary shed roof over the 
 compost repository, so that the turning and forming of 
 the heaps may progress when nothing else can be done 
 out of doors. By good management, then, it is quite 
 possible to save the time necessary for the preparation 
 of composts from the rainy days and too often wasted 
 hours of the year, and at its termination even the keen- 
 est compost-maker will often be surprised at the amount 
 of his accumulations. Referring more particularly to 
 pleasure-grounds, plantations, and land generally oc- 
 cupied by proprietors, the quantity of vegetable matters 
 which might be profitably collected during .the summer 
 and autumn months renders attention to this matter of 
 very great pecuniary importance. 

Defects in Stables. 

Knowing that horses often suffer in ways that their mas- 
 ters do not even suspect, and that there must be many, 
 both in city and country, among the readers of such a 
 paper as this, who would at once take measures to pre- 
 vent their horses from suffering, if only the sources or 
 causes of that suffering were brought under their no- 
 tice, we commenced in a former paper a brief series of 
 articles intended to point out to merciful men a few of 
 the more prominent of the sources of suffering and dis- 
 comfort to their horses which a little thought or pains- 
 taking might readily abate or remove entirely. 

In continuation of the subject of defects in stables we 
 wish, at this time, to direct attention to one of very 
 common occurrence and of very injurious consequences 
 — the want of sufficient ventilation. It seems as if the 
 bulk of those who construct stables, and of those who 
 have the care of horses, were of the opinion that good, 
 pure, fresh air is of no great use to a horse; and that if 
 horses only get plenty to eat and drink, and have not too 
 much to do, they must of necessity do very well. They 
 seem to be utterly ignorant of the well-established fact, 
 that for the maintenance of health and of life a plentiful 
 supply of fresh air is absolutely essential. It must 
 purely be from this ignorance, and not from hard-hearted 
 indifference to the comfort of their animals, that so many 
 shut them up in close stables, the atmosphere of which, 

when the door is first opened in the morning, is exceed- 
 ingly offensive to the nose, pungent to the eyes, and of 
 most disgreeable respiration. 

Whenever a disagreeable smell meets one when he 
 throws open a stable door, especially at the first opening 
 of the door in the morning, that stable is certainly de- 
 fective in its construction and unhealthy in its influences. 
 A horse breathing such an atmosphere during the whole 
 of a long night can not be as strong, lively, and vigorous 
 as if his lungs has been supplied with purer air. The 
 whole of the blood and humors of his system are more 
 or less contaminated with a poisonous and debilitating ma- 
 terial — a true materies morbi. Besides the aminoniacal and 
 other foul gases from the di-oppings and urine, there is 
 the effluvium arising from the insensible perspiration of 
 the skin, and futhermore a quantity of carbonic acid gas 
 generated by the lungs with each exhalation. No wonder 
 that after spending the long nights of a whole winter in 
 such an atmosphere, so many horses, and cattle also, 
 should be found lanquid, lazy, loggy, and nearly useless 
 in the spring — often at the very time when their utmost 
 vigor and strength might be very profitably and accept- 
 ably employed. 

But some do not escape with merely an impairment of 
 their usual health and vigor in the season of spring, but 
 are found to have weak or inflamed eyes, or to be easily 
 attacked by colds, coughs, influenzas, and inflammations 
 of the lungs. The breathing of foul and unwholesome 
 air during the long winter nights debilitates the tone of 
 the lungs and of the whole system, and when horses 
 which have been subjected to such a contaminated at- 
 mosphere are exposed, as they must be, to the sudden 
 changes of temperature and electrical conditions of the 
 air in spring, they readily take colds and become victims 
 of inflammatiou of the lungs. 

Horses that are compelled to spend half or more of 
 their time in an atmosphere saturated with ammoniacal 
 and carbonic acid gases, in which a man could not 
 breathe without painful discomfort one half hour, must 
 (it requires nothing more than common sense to see 
 that it must be so) always be in near proximity to, or 
 on the borders of, disease, and on very small exposures 
 must suffer from some attack more or less severe. If 
 we recollect aright, Dr. Dadd has somewhere stated in 
 his book, or in some contribution to the agricultural 
 journals, that horses have often been found dead in their 
 stalls from the effects of carbonized blood in a polluted 
 atmosphere, and that many more would probably die 
 were they not permitted to take a little of the breath of 
 life through the day. 

The subject will be continued in a future number. —

Profitable Culture. 
 An industrious laborer, who cultivates with his own 
 hands his own lands, has just informed me that he sold 
 125 barrels of onions, at $4,25 per barrel, delivered at 
 his cellar. These onions grew on about two-thirds of 
 an acre of ground.
