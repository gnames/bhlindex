character, performing its office in the most effective 
 manner. 

These cutters are built of two sizes, No. 1, being 
 designed for hand power, but may be used with horse 
 power, and is arranged to cut either one inch or half 
 an inch in length, as may be desired, by a change of 
 gears. The blades are ten inches in length. 

No. 2, has sixteen inch blades, and designed for horse 
 power, but may be used with hand power. It is so ar- 

ranged as to cut (by change of gear,) either one half 
 inch, one inch, or one or half inches in length as may 
 be desired. When propelled by a single horse power, 
 and properly fed, it is capable of cutting a ton of hay 
 one inch long in one hour. This seems extravagent, 
 but the machine will do it with ease if properly managed. 
 The price of No. 1, is $25, and of No. 2, $50.

PENNOCK'S IMPROVED DRILL. 

On page 230 of the present number, we spoke of 
 drilling wheat And of Pennock's Improved Drill. After 
 that part of tne Journal had been stereotyped, we re- 
 ceived from the Messrs. Pennocks the annexed cut of 
 their Drill and Seed Sower. 

STEACY'S PATENT GRAIN DRILL. 

Messrs. Landreth & Son have kindly furnished us 
 With the above cut and the following desci-iption : 

The above Drill was first exhibited at the State Fair 
 held at Powelton October 1855, and attracted consider- 
 able attention. It differs in many respects from the 
 generality of drills. The dropping of the grain is per- 
 formed by means of an iron slide, with square holes, 
 running horizontally the whole breadth of the machine, 
 under the seed boxes. The square holes in this slide 
 carry the grain from the seed boxes and drop it in the 
 boot. A small brush in the box at the side of each 
 aperture strikes off the overplues grain without bruising 
 it. Compartments in the boxes keep the grain confined 
 to each drill hole, thus dropping with the same regular- 
 ity upon hillside as upon level land. The slide is work- 

slide on this pinion gives the rod more or less eccentric 
 motion, thus giving to the slide under the seed boxes, a 
 long or short motion. By this means an exact measure- 
 ment or guage of the grain takes place every revolu- 
 tion of pinion wheel, a cog wheel on the axle works the 
 pinion. 

A very simple contrivance for sowing oats has lately 
 been added and works admirably. The grass seed sown 
 is a very simple and novel arrangement and does its 
 work with rare accuracy. A Land measurer is also 
 attached. 

The whole arrangement of the drill is simple in the 
 extreme. In Lancaster and other Counties in this State, 
 where it has been used, it has given universal satisfaction.
