The Fourth Duke of Athol. 

Lewis Hoopes, of Chester County, has recently pur- 
 chased of L. Spencer, West Chester New York, a very 
 handsome Bull Calf which, hy the right of descent 
 bears the title of the fourth Duke of Athol." Mr. 
 Spencer's stock is known to be among the most reliably 
 "pure bred" Durhains in this country, and our Chester 
 County friends are acting wisely by introducing it. 
 Chester County already has within her borders some of 
 the best Durhains to be found in this Commonwealth, 
 and the recent introductions by Messrs. Brinton, Hoopes 
 and others, show that the farmers there appreciate the 
 value of "pure bred stock." 

The following is the pedigree of the fourth Duke of 
 Athol :— 

Color red and white, — Calved February 18th 1855 — 
 Bred by L. Spencer, West Chester, New York. 

Got by imported Dutchess Bull, Duke of Athol 
 (10150). Dam Phoebe 3d, by Guanoney (68). G. Dam 
 Phoebe 1st. (imported,) by Earl Spencer's Durham Bull. 
 G. G. Dam by Young Commerick. 

Cooper's Lime Spreader. 
 William Sharpless, of West Goshen, Chester County, 
 requests us to state that he purchased one of Lewis 
 Cooper's Lime Spreaders some eighteen months since, 
 and after thorough trial is perfectly satisfied with its 
 performance. When the lime is in proper condition for 
 spreading — as it always should be — either by being 
 judiciously slacked with water, or air-slacked under 
 cover, our friend Sharpless says he can graduate his 
 spreader so as to distribute with tolerable certainty any 
 quantity, from ten to one hundred and fifty bushels per 
 acre, and he can spread it almost as evenly over the 
 ground as the drops of rain from a falling shower. 
 Where lime has lain out through the winter and been 
 converted into a mortar-bed, as is too frequently the case 
 among farmers, the spreader will not perform so well as 
 when the lime is in proper condition for spreading. It 
 would be asking rather too much of any machinery 
 to require it to exercise reasoning powers and adapt 
 itself to every contingency a careless farmer may im- 
 pose upon it. 

Machine for Shearing Sheep. 

The Michigan Farmer, says a machine has been in- 
 vented by Palmer Lancaster, of Burr Oak, in that state, 
 for shearing sheep, " that it works rapidly, cuts 
 with eveness, never cuts the sheep, nor the wool twice 
 in two." 

One of the difficulties we should suppose, in a such 
 a machine would be to induce the sheep to hold still, 
 particularly if there was much whizzing of cog and fly 
 wheels, turning of cranks &c. 

The article does not state, whether the sheep is put 
 into a hopper, and after a few revolutions, corne.s out 
 shomn, whether it is operated by a crank or lever, horse 
 or man power. There seems no limit to the inventive 
 genius af the country, but we had not looked for such a 
 machine as the above, and feel incredulous till we hear 
 more about it. We have seen an engraving of persons 
 getting shaved by machinery in a barber shop, some 
 fifteen or twenty at a time, and have also heard of a log
