of 'wood, being thrown into a machine in some cf the 
 New England towns, and ready made buckets coming out 
 at the other end. Such cases have been cited in proof 
 that this is a great country. The sheep shearing 
 machine, however appears to be a reality " as letters 
 patent have been granted, and the inventor desires to 
 sell rights." He hope he will come this way, as the old 
 fashioned sheep shears is our only machine for taking 
 the wool off sheep. 

Farmers' High School— $1000 Subscriptions. 

On another page, our readers will see the report of 
 the committee, to establish the Farmers' High School of 
 Pennsylvania. We think the trustees have acted wisely 
 in deferring a final decision, of the location for a couple 
 of months, till other sections than those now proposed, 
 have had time to throw in proposals, and see what they 
 can, do within their own limits. Believing that the es- 
 tablishment of this school, with the improved stock, 
 implements, system of management, and numerous 
 other incidental advantages which necessarly go with it, 
 will increase the bona fide value of property in its vici- 
 nity, and be specially advantageous in a variety of ways 
 to the county in which it is located we have been sur- 
 prised at the apathy of the Farmers in Eastern Pennsyl- 
 vania. Is there no public spirit in Chester, Lancaster, 
 Delaware, Buck's, and Montgomery Counties ? Are you 
 going to allow the Pennsylvania Farm School, to be 
 located west of the mountains, for want of a little effort. 
 Land is of course higher here than in more remote 
 places. The funds of the society will not enable it, to 
 purchase a farm, erect buildings, stock, improve, and 
 put it into successful operation by its own means, unassist- 
 ed. If a suitable farm were offered to be donated, for 
 the purpose in either of the counties we have named, 
 we presume there would be a general acquiescence in its 
 being located here, other advantages being equal. We 
 hope at least an effort will be made, and as a beginning, 
 we are authorized by a public spirited gentleman of this 
 city, to subscribe one thousand dollars to establish the 
 Farm School in either Delaware or Chester County. 
 Now are there not nineteen other equally liberal gentle- 
 man to contribute a like amount. We can hardly doubt 
 it, and the ball once started, we hope to receive similar 
 offers, so as to give notice in our next number 
 that twenty thousand dollars are subscribed. Please send 
 on the names. 

There are some sections we can name in these two 
 counties, where land of the best quality, accessible by a 
 railroad now constructing, and possessing all the advan- 
 tages needed for the Farm School, can be bought now at 
 quite a moderate rate. As it is proposed to locate it de- 
 finitely in September, there is no time to lose. Will our 
 friends assist us ? 

A Mammoth Cauliflower. 
 Our friend Dr. J. H. Bradford, of West Chester, has 
 presented as with a Cauliflower of most magnificent pro- 
 portions. The variety is the Early Asiatic, we believe, 
 and measured thirty fotir inches in circumference, 
 (around the head inside the leaves.) Upon discussing 
 its merits at the dinner table we were not disappointed 
 in the anticipations formed while measuring and admir- 

ing its proportions upon the table editorial ; it was rich, 
 luscious, and tender enough to win the admiration of a 
 capacious, over-fed Alderman, of course, such a delicacy 
 was not thrown away upon the more easily gratified 
 alimentiveness of a hard working editor. 

Dr. Bradford is one the most successful amateur 
 gardeners around West Chester. His garden, together 
 with the highly ornamented grounds about his resi- 
 dence, forms one of the most beautiful of the many 
 much admired attractions of the Borough of West 
 Chester. 

We intended this for the last number but owing to its 
 being sent with a deferred article, it met the same fate. 

Mercer County. 

We have a letter from S. Hoagland, Esq., correspond- 
 ing secretary of the Mercer county Agricultural Society, 
 enclosing a premium list for their approaching fall exhi- 
 bition. The schedule embraces a wide range of articles 
 calculated to excite competition, among the Farmers, 
 Horticulturists, and Mechanics, also for articles of do- 
 mestic manufacture. Mercer is one of our best counties 
 and this is her fourth annual exhibition. Judge Waugh 
 is to deliver the oration. 

In reference to the crops in Mercer county, this sea- 
 son, our informant says : 

The wheat crop of Mercer county is at this date about 
 half harvested ; it has received little or no damage from 
 the yellow weevil or other insects. The yield both in 
 quality and quantity surpasses that of many years pre- 
 vious. On a moderate calculation there was double the 
 rye put out last fall that there was the year before, and 
 the yield is bountiful ; many stalks measuring seven 
 feet six inches and over. Owing to many fine warm 
 showers of rain for six weeks past, the oats and grass are 
 big, almost beyond description. In short all kinds of 
 vegetable crops promise bountifully, and our good pas- 
 ture fields have caused our herds of Durhams and Dev- 
 ons to shed their old coats of hard times, (worn last 
 spring and winter), and come forth in all the beauties 
 that characterize the breeds. Judge Waugh of West 
 Greenwich, has been invited to deliver our annual ad- 
 dress. Yours truly, S. HOAGLAND.

Colza or Rape Seed. 
 I have now gathered a crop of Winter Rape or Colza, 
 amounting to about thirty two bushels per acre. The 
 seed is of good quality. This, I believe, will, or ought 
 to answer all inquiries or objections to the raising of it. 
 Recollect, that this is raised in New Jersey, and that I 
 firmly believe, that sixty to seventy bushels per acre 
 can be raised : — mine, as observed in former communi- 
 cations, was sown under adverse circumstances, in new 
 land, among stumps, &c. Any one wishing to engage 
 in the cultivation of it, need not be apprehensive about 
 the disposal of the crop. I wish to purchase any quan- 
 tity that can be raised and pay two dollars to two dol- 
 lars and a half per bushel for it in cash. Further in- 
 formation can be had of me, or of Mr. D. Landreth, 6th 
 street, or Paschall Morris & Co. Philadelphia.
