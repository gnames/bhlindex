She's broad in her ribs, and long in her rump, 
 A straight and flat back, with never a hump ; 
 She's wide in her hips, and calm in her eyes, 
 She's firm in her shoulders, and thin in her thighs; 
 She's light in her neck, and small in her tail, 
 She's wide in her breast, and good at the pail; 
 She's fine in her bone, and silky of skin, 
 She's a grazier's without, and a butcher's within. 
 Having been asked to speak of the color of the De- 
 vons, as some persons fancy those of a dark color are 
 the best, aDd those of a light color in some way related 
 to the South Hams breed of Devons, I can only repeat 
 in answer to the latter supposition, a remark which fell 
 from a friend of mine, namely : "That the North Dev- 
 ons differ from the South Hams beasts in almost every- 
 thing which is necessary to constitute a good animal." 
 Many of the best Devons I ever saw were of a light 
 color : this is the only respect in which they resemble 
 the South Hams breed. The light-colored Devons are 
 generally of "the best quality ; i. e. they fatten quickest; 
 although I think those of a darker red color the most 
 hardy : the danger is, when they are too dark, the skin 
 is frequently coarse and the hair wiry, consequently 
 they are not of so rich quality. The best course to fol- 
 low is the via media, — to get our cattle of a middle col- 
 or, neither too dark nor too light ; we then combine the 
 hardy constitution of the former with the "high proof" 
 of the latter. As to a little white about the udder, I 
 cannot account for ; and having been told by my father 
 (who has bred Devons for fifty years) and others, that 
 it cannot be accounted for, and knowing that some of 
 the best and purest Devons that have ever been bred by 
 all the breeders in the kingdom have had white about 
 the udder, I should not refuse a good animal on that 
 account ; but the white must be confined to that part 
 alone. Had I been writing for the use of breeders only, 
 those remarks would have been unnecessary : in this 
 case I do it for the benefit of those who are not so well 
 acquainted with this valuable breed." 

Smells Produced by Decaying Substances. 

The most numerous class of disagreeable smells is 
 that which is produced by the decay or decomposition of 
 animal and vegetable substances. Our dislike of these 
 smells arises partly no doubt from their being associated 
 in our minds with unpleasant sights and ideas, and 
 partly from their being found by experience to be inju- 
 rious to human health. 

The Putrefaction of Animal Bodies. — The general na- 
 ture and odour of the ill-smelling substances produced 
 during the putrefaction of animal bodies are determin- 
 ed by the sulphur and phosphorus which are contained 
 in them. During their decay the sulphur combines with 
 the constituents of the animal matter, and forms fetid 
 compounds similar to those already described as occur- 
 ing in the mineral and vegetable kingdoms. The phos- 
 phorus also enters into combinations scarcely less un- 
 pleasant and injurious. And with both of these classes 
 of compound bodies are associated others peculiar to 
 animal forms of matter, which have not yet been sepa- 
 rately examined. All these unite in producing those 
 mixed smells which distinguish so repulsively the natu- 
 ral decay of animal substances in the open air. 

Of the presence of sulphur in such cases, a familiar 
 example is presented by a rotten egg. When such an 

egg is broken, the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen is at 
 once perceived, and a silver spoon put into it becomes 
 black immediately from the action of sulphur. As the 
 decay proceeds, other smells gradually become sensible, 
 and these mingling with that of the sulphuretted hy- 
 drogen, occasion that growing offensiveness which the 
 rotting egg is known to exhibit. 

In warm climates, decomposition of this kind proceeds 
 more rapidly, and the strong-smelling substances are 
 produced both sooner and in greater abundance. The 
 intensity of the odours emitted, and the distances to 
 which they are diffused through the air in hot countries, 
 may be inferred from the extremely short period of time 
 required to bring the vulture and condor even from 
 great distances. They scent afar off the decaying car- 
 cass, where the human organs refuse to give any indi- 
 cations of its presence. 

Air, moisture, and a certain degree of warmth are 
 necessary to the decay of animal bodies. If any of 
 these three conditions be wanting, it either proceeds 
 more slowly, or ceases altogether. Thus, in cool dry 
 vaults, dug in an absorbent soil, and through which a 
 current of dry air passes, human bodies sometimes be- 
 come dry before they have had time to decay, and grad- 
 ually shrivel up into frightful mummies. So in the dry 
 air of some hot climates, as in the Pampas of South 
 America, and on the borders of the African deserts, the 
 flesh of animals can be dried and preserved for any 
 length of time, without exhibiting symptoms of decay, 
 or any manifest evil odour. 

But where moisture continues present — even though 
 warmth and air be in a great measure excluded — decay 
 still slowly takes place, and substances of evil odour 
 and malign influence continue for a long period to be 
 produced and given off. The true chemical nature and 
 exact composition of many of the volatile and gaseous 
 substances, produced under these circumstances, is still 
 unknown ; but both theory and experience prove that 
 they are injurious to human health. They are so, even 
 when, from their extreme state of dilution, the organs 
 of smell are naturally insensible to their presence, or 
 when, by habit, they have become so. Hence the cus- 
 tom of placing grave-yards in the neighborhood of our 
 dwellings, or of requiring people to sit for so many 
 hours a-week over putrid family vaults, or heaps of 
 mouldering human dust — is as contrary to the dictates 
 of science and enlightened common sense, as it is to the 
 often-repeated suggestions of sanitary experience. That 
 the senses detect no danger, proves that the senses are 
 not to be relied upon — not that even serious danger is 
 absent. 

The Droppings of Animals, both while recent, and du- 
 ring the decay they undergo in the presence of ah* and 
 moisture, are the source of some of the most unpleasant 
 smells with which we become familiar in common life. 
 These animal excretions emit certain strong-smelling 
 substances which are common to them all, but each va- 
 riety also gives off smells peculiar to itself. 

When in a state of fermentation, for example, all 
 evolve ammonia ; but it escapes in especial abundance 
 from horse- dung in hot stables, and from nightsoil in 
 ash-pits and necessaries during hot weather. All also 
 produce and give off the noxious sulphuretted hydrogen
