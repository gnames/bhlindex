already described ; but where nightsoil ferments in 
 close places, such as cess-pools and common drains, this 
 sulphureous gas sometimes accumulates in sufficient 
 quantity to strike down instantly the workman who 
 is incautious enough to place his mouth within its 
 reach. Compounds of phosphorus likewise escape from 
 all, and volatile alkaline compounds, which have not 
 hitherto been particularly examined. 

When recent or fresh, on the other hand, each variety 
 emits its own peculiar odor. The droppings of the cow 
 and the horse differ most distinctly in smell, both from 
 each other and from nightsoil. Goat's dung has a smell 
 which it imparts to plants manured with it, so as to 
 give a perceptible flavor even to the tobacco leaf. Pig's 
 dung is to most people nearly intolerable, and even ani- 
 mals dislike it. It not only gives its flavor to tobacco, 
 but, when properly applied, it drives away the wire- 
 worm from the carrot and the onion. The reader will 
 not be surprised to learn that the chemical nature and 
 composition of the compound bodies from which these 
 noisome smells proceed, should still be in a great meas- 
 ure unknown. However interesting, in a physiological 
 and sanitary point of view, it would be to possess a 
 complete knowledge of all the substances which animal 
 droppings contain — of the mode of their production — 
 and of the nature of their several actions on the animal 
 economy — we must be content to wait while it slowly 
 and gradually collects. The inquiry is of too repulsive 
 a nature to be undertaken by any chemist whose love of 
 knowledge, or desire to advance a favorite branch of 
 the science, is not of a very ardent kind. 

There are certain known differences, however, in the 
 composition of the solid droppings of different animals, 
 which must affect the nature of the smells they sever- 
 ally emit. Thus man discharges through his kidneys a 
 large proportion of the phosphorus contained in the 
 food he eats ; while the cow, the horse, and the sheep, 
 emit none of it in this way. All the phosphorus which 
 these animals eat, therefore, is rejected in their solid 
 droppings ; and inasmuch as the compounds of phos- 
 phorus which are formed in decaying animal and vege- 
 table substances, are generally distinguished by peculi- 
 ar and offensive smells it is easy to understand that the 
 droppings of these animals, when they heat and fer- 
 ment, must emit some — more or less nauseous, and 
 probabiy injurious — odours, which are not to be recog- 
 nised in similarly fermenting nightsoil. — Johnston's Chem. 

Salting of Meat and Fat of Animals. 
 The application of salt to fresh meat has very much 
 of the same effect as the application of a quick heat. It 
 causes the fibres to contract, the meat to lesson in bulk 
 and the juice to flow out from its pores. Hence the 
 reason why dry salt strewed upon fresh lean meat 
 gradually dissolves into a fluid brine. The effect of the 
 salt, if a large quantity be applied, penetrates deep, so 
 that much as one-third of the juice of the meat is often 
 forced out by the contraction of the fibres. The effect 
 of this upon the meat is twofold. It diminishes the 
 natural flavour, by removing a large proportion of the 
 peculiar substances contained in the juice, and adding 
 pure salt in their stead. At the same time it closes up 
 the pores of the meat, and prevents the entrance of 

atmospheric air, thus diminishing the liability to decay. 
 The preservation of flesh meat by salting, depends 
 therefore, upon the separation of water, upon the ex- 
 clusion of air, upon the saturation with salt of the juice 
 which remains in the meat, and upon the formation of a 
 weak compound of the flesh with common salt, which 
 does not readily undergo decay. But this preservation 
 is attended by a diminution in its nutritive qualities, for 
 the juice which flows out contains albumen (white of 
 egg), kreatin, phosphoric acid, and potash. These sub- 
 stances are precisely the same as are more fully extract- 
 ed by water, in the method of making savoury beef-tea, 
 already described, and in proportion as they are ex- 
 tracted they diminish the nutritive properties of the 
 meat. Hence one reason why long feeding on salt meat 
 afiects the health, and why vegetable and other sub- 
 stances, which are capable of supplying what the meat 
 had lost, are found to be the best means of restoring it. 
 As a whole, flesh meat is eminently nutritious, because 
 it contains all the materials which are necessary to build 
 up our own flesh ; but remove from it a portion of these 
 materials, and the remainder becomes more or less use- 
 less, — as bricks and stone become useless to the builder 
 if we refuse him the requisite quantity of mortar. 

The Fat of Animal and Vegetable Substances. — We 
 have seen that, as a whole, there is much analogy be- 
 tween the bx - ead and the beef, — the vegetable and the 
 animal forms of food on which we live. Between the 
 gluten of the one and the fibrin of the other, we have 
 also found a very close similarity, and that in the animal 
 economy they are both fitted and intended to serve the 
 same main purpose. If we compare the fatty portions 
 of both, we find new resemblances. 

Most of the varieties of fat yielded by our common 
 European vegetables are fluid and oily at ordinary tem- 
 peratures. Such is the case with the fat extracted from 
 wheat, from oats, from Indian corn, from linseed, from 
 the olive, the poppy, the walnut, &c. The fat of the 
 oil palm, however, commonly known by the name of 
 palm-oil, and some other vegetable fats or butters, are 
 solid in the natural state, and at ordinary temperatures. 
 And even the oily fats, olive oil for example, when ex- 
 posed to a low temperature, congeal or freeze to a certain 
 extent, and allow of the separation of a solid fat in 
 greater or less proportion. On the other hand, those 
 which are solid yield to pressure a quantity of a liquid 
 fatty oil. So that in reality all vegetable fats consist of 
 two fatty substances, one of which is solid, and the 
 other liquid, at ordinary temperatures. 

Now, the same is the case with the animal fats — with 
 those of beef and mutton for example, with the butter 
 of milk, and with the oil contained in the yolk of the 
 egg. All consist of a solid and a liquid fat, and in this 
 fact we see a new analogy between our vegetable and our 
 animal food. 

But a still further and more intimate analogy exists 
 between the solid portions of the fatty substances of the 
 animal and vegetable kingdoms. When the solid fat of 
 palm- oil is properly purified it is found to consist of a 
 solid, beautifully white, peculiar fatty body, to which the 
 name of palmitine has been given. On the other hand, 
 when beef and mutton fats are pressed from the oil they 
 contain, and then purified, the most abundant sub-
