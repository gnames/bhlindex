stance obtained is a peculiar fat which is known by the 
 name of stearine. The remainder consists principally of 
 palmitine. 

Now, of these two fatty bodies the solid fat of all our 
 domestic animals almost entirely consists. In beef and 
 mutton fats the stearine is the more abundant. In hu- 
 man fat, in that of the goose, and in that of butter, the 
 stearine and palmitine are in nearly equal proportions. 
 It is the same with vegetable fats. They consist of 
 these two varieties in different proportions. In some 
 the solid part consists chiefly of stearine; in others, as 
 in olive-oil, the stearine and palmitine are nearly equal 
 in quantity ; while in others again, as in palm oil, the 
 palmitine is the principal ingredient. Thus, as there is 
 a kind of identity in nutritive quality and value among 
 the compounds represented respectively by gluten in 
 plants and by fibrin in animals, so there is an absolute 
 identity of substance — as regards their solid part at 
 least — among the fatty compounds which are met with 
 in the eatable productions of both kingdoms. 

The liquid portions of the fats of animals and vege- 
 tables, though generally regarded as being also for the 
 most part identical, are not yet so well understood as 
 theirsolid portions. It is a fact of practical interest, how- 
 ever that they become rancid by exposure to the air soon- 
 er than the solid fats do. Hence hard butter keeps sweet 
 longer than soft butter does. Hence, also, fat meat 
 keeps longer, when salted, if the fat be hard. And 
 hence the reason why, in finishing off fat animals for 
 the butcher, especially if they are to be salted it is usual 
 to give dry food for sometime before killing, that the fat 
 may be hardened and the flesh made firm. 

In another matter of detail I might show how, in still 
 more minute matters, animaj. and vegetable kinds of 
 food are nearly identical. When the parts of plants are 
 burned in the open air they disappear for the most part, 
 as I have already shown, and leave only a small pro- 
 portion of ash behind. This ash consists of a mixture 
 of various substances, spoken of as their mineral, earthy, 
 saline, or inorganic constituents. 

The same takes place when the parts of animals are 
 burned; and the mixture of mineral matters obtained 
 consists, in either case, of the same substances, only 
 differing more or less in their relative proportions. The 
 same things occur in the ash of bread as are found in 
 ash of beef. In whatever degree, therefore, the nutri- 
 tive properties of our food depend upon the kind of 
 mineral matter it contains, it is almost a matter of 
 indifference whether we live upon an animal or a vegeta- 
 ble diet. 

But to this interesting point I shall have occasion to 
 return in a subsequent chapter. — Johnson's Chemistry. 

Best Strawberries and Cherries. 
 Several members of the Fruit Growers' Society of 
 Western New York met in Rochester on the second inst., 
 for the examination of strawberries and cherries. After 
 a thorough examination, a vote was taken by ballot in 
 regard to the best single variety, best three varieties, 
 best six varieties, and the best market sort. The fol- 
 lowing is given in the Country Gentleman as a summary 
 of the decisions. The voters comprise several of the 
 most distinguished horticulturists in Western New York: 

Strawberries. — From the preceding it will be ob- 
 served that for the best single sort, Burr's New Pine had 
 three votes, Large Early Scarlet had two, and Walker's 
 Seedling, Gushing, and Genesee had each one. 

For the three best, Burr's New Pine had six votes, 
 Walker's Seedling had five. Genesee three, Large Early 
 Scarlet three, Cushing two, and Hovey, Crimson Cone, 
 Moyamensing, and McAvoy's No. 1, each one vote. 

For the six best, Burr's New Pine had six votes, 
 Walk, r and Large Early Scarlet each five, Genesee four, 
 Moyamensing and Hovey each three, Crimson Cone and 
 Ellwanger & Barry's No. 1 each two, and Old Hudson, 
 Iowa, Jenney, Cushing, Orange Prolific, Trollop's Vic- 
 toria, and Triomphe de Gand, each one vote. 

For bad strawberries, McAvoy's Extra Red polled a 
 full vote, evidently on account of its flavor, which is very 
 sour and very poor. Cushing, strangely enough, had 
 two for its bad quality, and yet was placed by one as best 
 of all. This is accounted for by the fact that it is large, 
 handsome, well formed and productive; while its peculiar 
 flavor is very much disliked by some. 

Cherries. — Six votes for Governor Wood as best, and 
 two for Mayduke. For the three best, Gov. Wood and 
 Black Tartarian had each four votes, Mayduke three, 
 Yellow Spanish and Mezel two each, and Downer's Late, 
 Sparhawk's Honey, Knight's Early Black, Reine Hor- 
 tense, Belle Magnirique, and Belle d'Orleans each one 
 vote. 

Crops of 1855. 

So vague and uncertain generally are reports about 
 crops, and so often have apparently the most reasonable 
 calculations proved at fault, that we have generally 
 avoided speculating on the subject. Newspaper reports 
 and reports of travellers differ in their estimates even of 
 the same district, and are often made up from the mere 
 chance assertion of one or two individuals, whose opin- 
 ions were based only on casual observation. 

We have in the United States such a variety of soil 
 and climate, such an immense extent of arable land, that 
 a general failure of crops would seem almost impossible 
 from natural causes, and yet the past season seemed 
 more like it, there bring a more general dearth of the 
 necessaries of life, and a more absolute scarcity, than 
 we ever recollect to have known. Wheat and Potatoes 
 commanded the past winter, three dollars per bushel: 
 corn one dollar fifteen cents ; oats eighty cents ; turnips 
 seventy-five cents, and other vegetables in the same pro- 
 portion. These prices were not the result of mere spec- 
 ulation, but on account of the supply being short of the 
 demand, decreased production and increased consumption, 
 attributable to the general prevalence of drought, which 
 in many of the finest grain districts of the West, cut off 
 the crops, so that they barely yielded the seed, and de- 
 f troyed thousands of cattle for want of food or water or 
 both. 

The present year with the exception of partial and 
 local failures, our opinion is from the aggregate and 
 united reports from every section of the union, that 
 there has been in the United States an amount of pro- 
 duction exceeding every thing yet known in our history, 
 and calculated to create astonishmeut at our resources. 
 It is yet impossible to ascertain the amount of excess over
