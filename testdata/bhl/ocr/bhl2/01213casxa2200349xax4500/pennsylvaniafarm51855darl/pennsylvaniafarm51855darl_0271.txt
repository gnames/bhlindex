la consequence of protracted and increasing indispo- 
 sition, induced by long continued sedentary occupations, 
 the subscriber has been forced to relinquish his connec- 
 tion ■with this establishment, and seek, amid rural occu- 
 pations, and by more active physical exertions, a resto- 
 ration to health — the blessing of life. His interest has 
 been purchased by Samuel Emlen, and the Farm Journal 
 will hereafter be published by Samuel Emlen & Co., N.

Wheat Turning to Cheat. 

We have received from our friend Henry Miller, 
 another communication on the above subject, which we 
 should cheerfully publish, if we thought it would have 
 the least tendency to settle the "mooted question." 
 So much has been already written, that it is reasonable 
 to conclude nothing more can be said to produce any 
 change of opinion, either in the believers for or against 
 transmutation. The cheat, question, like the question 
 about the moon's phases, 'will never be settled by any 
 general agreement or conviction. "Those convinced 
 against their 'will, will be of the same opinion still." 
 We believe that wheat never yet has changed to cheat, 
 and never will. Our belief, however, is not of any more 
 value than others, and after being open to conviction 
 for many years, and waited in vain for any single fact 
 in proof, the case is now closed on our part, and we 
 cannot be satisfied of the transmutation of wheat into 
 cheat, by anything that can be said on the subject. 
 We doubt not, but that is the conclusion of nearly every 
 body else. We give below a letter from the distin- 
 guished Botanist, Prof. Asa Gray, of Harvard College, 
 about a plausible looking specimen sent to him, which 
 will answer well for the closing argument in the trial 
 of wheat vs. cheat. 

Letter from Prof. Asa Gray, Harvard College. 

Dear Sir : — I have duly received your favor of the 
 10th inst., enclosing a head of wheat, sent to you as a 
 specimen showing the actual transformation of wheat 
 into chess on one side of the ear. Having a leisure 
 moment, I have just submitted it to examination, in 
 which I have had the assistance of Mr. Sanford How- 
 17 

ard, editor of the Boston Cultivator. The spikelet of 
 chess is very evident to observation on one side of the 
 spike. The only question was, whether it was really 
 attached to, or grew from the spike of wheat. On de- 
 taching that spikelet of wheat to which it seemed to 
 belong, under a moderately magnifying lens, to secure 
 a more certain view, it was at oijce evident that the 
 spikelet of chess was merely entangled in the wheat by 
 its long and slender stalk, but had no organic connection 
 with it. I return it to you, herewith, undisturbed; 
 that you may satisfy yourself or your friends who be- 
 lieve in transmutation, as to the real state of the case. 
 A year or two ago I received a similar specimen from 
 Michigan or Iowa, I forget which. I then thought that 
 the chess had been purposely introduced into the wheat 
 spike. But I am now convinced that it was accidentally 
 entangled, as Mi". Howard suggests, and it is easy to 
 see how this might readily take place. Very respect- 
 fully yours, ASA GRAY. — Michigan Farmer. 

Westmoreland County Agricultural Society. 

Editor of the Farm Journal: — Dear Sir: — "The 
 Westmoreland County Agricultural Society" will hold 
 its "second annual Exhibition and Fair" on the 10th, 
 11th, and 12th days of October next, at Greensburgh. 
 Our premium list is a large and liberal one, and every 
 convenience and accommodation will be afforded to Ex- 
 hibitors. How does it come that Manufacturers do not 
 send specimens of their fabrics to the County Exhibi- 
 tions? Don't they know, that it would be the very best 
 method they could adopt, to dispose of them ? If it be 
 our interest to purchase, surely it is no less the interest 
 of the Manufacturer to exhibit his wares. Shall we 
 have any thing from the City, at our Show, or "is it not 
 worth while? 

The following persons compose the Officers of the So- 
 ciety, for the current year. 

President — F. J. Cope. 

Recording Secretary — John W. Turney. 

Corresponding Secretary — D. K. Marchand. 

Treasurer — Thomas J. Barclay. 

Committee of Arrangements — John Eichar, James 
 Trees, John W. Turney. 

Board of Managers, and several Vice Presidents, whose 
 names I cannot just now furnish. 

In our list of premiums, a large number of the "Farm 
 Journal" are substituted for "cash," as we think we can, 
 serve the cause of Agriculture by introducing your pe~
