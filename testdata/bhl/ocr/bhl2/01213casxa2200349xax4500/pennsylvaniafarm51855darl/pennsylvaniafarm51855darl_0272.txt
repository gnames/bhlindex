Steam for Agricultural Purposes. 

The Royal Agricultural Society of England have offered 
 a premium of two hundred pounds for the best steam-culti- 
 vator or substitute for the plow. The competition was to 
 take place at the annual exhibition of the Royal Agricultural 
 Society at Carlisle, July 19th. As the subject has excited 
 very considerable attention in England, we copy from the 
 English Agricultural Gazette, a letter addressed to the com- 
 mittee having control of the awards, in which are set forth 
 tho alleged advantages of the steam-cultivator or digger, 
 over the plow and spade. Tho inventive genius of the two 
 countries, heretofore chiefly directed to other branches of 
 industry, has now fairly turned towards Agriculture. But 
 a few years ago Reaping and Mowing Machines were 
 thought impracticable, and seeing what has been done in 
 them and other implements, it will hardly do to be startled 
 now even at the idea of the introduction of steam for Agri- 
 cultural purposes. The article is as follows: — "Two hundred 
 pounds for the steam-cultivator that shall in the most efficient 
 manner turn the soil, and be an economical substitute for 
 the plow or the spade. 

"Turn the soil." Mark this expression ; for the whole 
 character and efficiency of the machine depends on this poiut. 
 Break up, loosen and commingle the soil as much as you 
 please, in preparing a seed-bed for any crop, but if weeds 
 and grasses be left still green on the surface, if the seeds of our 
 annual infesting enemies remain in favorable exposure to the 
 vivifying sunshine and feeding dews, your tillage will be ut- 
 terly abortive. On the other hand, if the ground be a stub- 
 ble, bury every weed and withering stalk, and you promote 
 its decomposition in the soil, making manure of what would 
 otherwise injure as well as encumber; if it be a sward or a 
 lea, still more urgently must you inter every blade and plant 
 that might spring up amongst your intended crop. In the 
 fundamental operation of tillage, the destruction of all rem- 
 nants of old crops, and tho loosening-up of the staple for a 
 succeeding one you must '"turn the soil." Was it not for 
 this very purpose of burying obnoxious vegetation, and 
 opening up a fresh surface of earth, that plows with mould- 
 boards superseded the imperfect scratching instruments of 
 yore? Is not the chief fault of tho plow itself that it does 
 not completely hide all surface vegetation, but too often (es- 
 pecially when the plowman is blameable) leaves grass or other 
 living growth to shoot up among the seams of its furrows, 
 and defy the weedcr of the coming crop ? For many tillage 
 purposes — such as autumn c^ansing or spring grubbing — 
 no such inversion is needed ; but in the first and foundation 
 work of breaking up after a crop, and to tho full depth of the 
 intended staple, you must "turn the soil." Perhaps an instru- 
 ment able to stir and mix every portion of a deep staple, 
 might be made to bring up repeated instalments of earth long 
 buried, and thrust down the long exposed surface to take its 
 place, at the same time forking out root-weeds and rubbish. 
 As far as fertilisation is concerned, perhaps a frequent commix- 
 ing of soil and subsoil might suffice, instead of alternate expo- 
 sure of each upon the surface; but the consideration of weeds 
 alone inculcates the necessity of "turning the soil." There- 
 fore we maintain that the first condition of the Society's of- 
 fer is well chosen, and that tho premium will be misappropria- 
 ted in the opinion of practical men, if given to a machine 
 (no matter how expert at comminution) that cannot entirely 
 taiivv the surface. 

Then it must be also "an economical substitute for the plow 

or the spade." If there shall bo an engine that turns over 
 furrows effectively at less cost than the plow — (first expense 
 included) although it may be incapable of any other labor — 
 give it the prize. And should thero be a machino unable to 
 prew at all, but able to dig in as perfect a manner as men can 
 with spades — if it will perform this work alone more cheaply 
 than men, it is entitled to the prize. Plowing ought to be 
 accomplished for less money than by horses, and digging 
 (though this of course is a more expensive operation) at less 
 cost than by men. 

The judges have not to determine whether or not digging a la 
 spade will be too expensive for the farmer although indispen- 
 sable to the market gardener; whether or not a cheaply-dig- 
 ging engine would not inaugurate miracles upon the clays ; 
 but (useful or not) according to the terms of the offer, they 
 must award the premium either to an engine that digs more 
 economically than the spade,or that plows more economically 
 than our present horse-plow. Should a machine be pro- 
 duced of sufficient versatile powers to execute both shallow 
 work like a plow and deep work like a spade, such a doubly 
 clever contrivance will of course merit the palm. 

Before awarding the prize and so pronouncing some in- 
 vention to be an "economical substitute" for the implements 
 with which we break up and invert whole ground — not 
 merely for the grubbers and harrows with which we stir and 
 pulverize soil already broken — let the judges well weigh this 
 point of "economy." They must not sanction with tho au- 
 thority of the Society, any machine that they dare not rec- 
 ommend to farmers or gardeners in place of the plow or spade. 
 Besides the working expenses, tbey must calculate the wear 
 and tear and the interest of the first outlay in purchasing the 
 machine; and on the other side of the account they must be 
 prepared with similar estimations of the charges for food, 
 attendance, depreciations, &c, attaching to horses and com- 
 mon implements. On the credit side they will have to 
 compare the excellence or inferiority of the respective ope- 
 rations; and particularly they should fix a money value upon 
 the time saved in the performance of tho work, inasmuch as . 
 there is a great advantage in having a breadth of land pre- 
 pared for sowing in less time than usual though the acreage 
 expense may be the same; and any means (without incurring 
 any neutralising disadvantage), which gives the husbandman 
 greater command over his soil, and more independence of the 
 weather, is certainly to be valued as a pecuniary gain. 

Perhaps it may be unwise in the judges to trouble them- 
 selves with any further speculations as to tho probable effects 
 of displacing a considerable part of the farmer's teams, em- 
 ploying more or less laborers, <fcc; as it has been generally 
 found that when a new machine is worth having — the steam 
 thresher, for instance — all questions as to the disposal of 
 surplus horses, &c. &c, regulate themselves very easilv and 
 speodily. Once furnish tho Agricultural public with a really 
 "economical substitute" for anything, and depend upon it

 vent him from using it. — I. A. C. — Eng. Ag. Gazette.

Mode of Extracting Tallow from thy. Tallow Tree. — 
 A few days ago, a gentleman residing in Texas addressed 
 the Commissioner of Patents in regard to the tallow tree, 
 and desired to be furnished with the best mode of extracting 
 the tallow. We copy the method recommended by this office 

"The seeds of the tallow tree [stilling ia sehifera) are pickti 
 in China at the commencement of the cold weather, in Nov- 
 ember and December, when all the leaves have fallen. The 
 seeds are in the first place, taken to the building where the 
 process of making the tallow is carried on, and picked and 
 separated from the stalks. They are then put into a wooden
