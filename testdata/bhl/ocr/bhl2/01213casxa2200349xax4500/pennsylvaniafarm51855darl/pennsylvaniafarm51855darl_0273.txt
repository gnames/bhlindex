cylinder, open at the top, but with a perforated bottom. 
 This is placed over an iron vessel (about the same diameter, 
 or rather larger than the wooden cylinder, and about 6 or 8 
 inches deep) containing water by which means the seeds are 
 well steamed, for the purpose of softening the tallow and 
 causing it more readily to separate. The furnace has four 
 or five iron vessels in a row, about three feet high, four or 
 five feet broad, and eight or ten feet long. The fire is 
 placed at one end and fed with the husks of the rice, dry 
 grass, and such like cheap materials, which make a great 
 flame, and the flue is of course carried directly under the 
 whole of the iron vessels. 

When the seeds have steamed ten minutes or a quarter of 
 an hour, they are thrown into a large stone mortar, and are 
 generally beaten by two men with stone mallets for the pur- 
 pose of detaching the tallow from the other parts of the seed. 
 They are then thrown into a sieve, heated over the fire, and 
 sifted, by which process the tallow is separated, or nearly so, 
 although they generally undergo the process of steaming, <fcc, 
 a second time that nothing may be lost. The other part of 
 the seed is ground and pressed for oil. 

The tallow now resembles coarse linseed meal, but with 
 more white spots in it and derives its brown color from the 
 thin covering over the seed, (between it and the tallow,) which 
 is separated by the pounding and sifting. In this state it is 
 put between circles of twisted straw, five or six of which are 
 laid upon each other, and thus forming a hollow cylinder 
 for its reception. When this straw cylinder has been filled it 
 is carried away and placed in the press, which is a very rude 
 and simple contrivance, but which like every thing Chinese, 
 answers the purpose remarkably well. The press consists 
 of longitudinal beams of considerable thickness, placed 
 about afoot and a half or two feet asunder, with a thin plank 
 at the bottom, forming a kind of trough, and the whole is 
 bound together with iron. 

The tallow is pressed out by means of wedges, driven in 
 very tightly with stone mallets, and passes through a hole in 
 the bottom of the press into a tub, which is sunk there to re- 
 ceive it. It is now freed from all impurities, and is a semi- 
 fluid of beautiful white color, but soon gets solid, and in cold 
 weather is very brittle. The inside of the tubs which collect 
 the tallow is sprinkled or dusted over with a fine red earth, 
 well dried, which prevents the tallow from adhering to the 
 sides. It is thus easily removed in a solid state from tho tubs, 
 and in this condition the cakes are exposed for sale in the 
 market. As the candles made from this vegetable tallow have 
 a tendency to get softand melt in hot weather, they are 
 commonly dipped in wax of various colors, as red, green and 
 yellow. Those which are intended for religious purposes 
 are generally very large and finely ornamented with golden 
 characters. 

The cake, or refuse, which remains after the tallow has 
 been pressed out of it, is used for fuel, or to manure the land, 
 and so is the seed from the other part of the seeds from 
 which oil is extracted." 

It may be remarked that this tree has been cultivated in 
 South Carolina for more than a hundred years, and appears 
 well adapted to the climate. 

Making Butter. 

I do not propose to go into all the mysteries of making 
 and preserving butter, but give some general facts which 
 those who are desirous of learning may turn to account It 
 has already been stated that cream is a mixture of oil, or 
 butter (for, with the exception of a little salt, it is the same 
 thing) and curd. The butter, in small globules, is wrapped 
 up in little sacks, or bags, of curd. 

Now the thing to be done, in order to make butter, is, to 

break open these sacks and let tho butter out. When this 
 is done, we say, ''The butter comes; and sure enough it does 
 come — comes out of the sacks. Those globules which were 
 before kept apart by the sacks, come together, thousands, 
 of them, to form a particle largo enough to be seen by the 
 unaided eye. And now does the reader say the more vio- 
 lently the churning is done, the sooner will the sacks be 
 broken ? Not so. You cannot break them by mechanical 
 force; it is a chemical process. Put them in right circum- 
 stances, and they will break open themselves. Pounding 
 will not break them. They will slip away from under the 
 blows unbroken, just as a foot-ball will leave your foot when 
 you give it a hard kick, but will leave it whole. Pressure 
 will not break them. Nothing will break them till you put 
 them into the rigKt circumstances, as to temperature and expo- 
 sure to air, 

At 40° Fahrenheit, you might churn from January to 
 March, or at 100° you might churn from June to September, 
 and no butter would come. Or if you were to exclude the air 
 entirely from the inside of the churn, you might roll that 
 churn, wit. tho cream in it, from Cape Horn to Labrador, 
 and the butter would not come. 

All the processes of nature have their conditions. The 
 separation of butter from curd is one of these processes. The 
 conditions must be complied with. We will suppose that the 
 cream is from cows that give good milk. The farmer is mu 
 wise who keeps any other. Some cows' milk will not give 
 much butter, for there is not much butter in it. We will 
 suppose also that the milk has been kept at a temperature 
 about medium between freezing and summer heat; that the 
 cream has been taken off while the milk was yet sweet, and 
 has been kept in a cool place till it was a little sour, or was 
 very near the point of souring; that it is now put into a clean 
 churn, and brought up to a temperature of about 60° Fahren- 
 heit, gradually and without much stirring; and that we now 
 begin to lift the dasher, or turn the crank as the case may 
 be, either forcing air into the cream by some patent contri- 
 vance, or at least letting air have free access to its surface, 
 and now let us see what happens. 

By stirring tho cream we change the surface often, and thus 
 bring all parts of it successively into contact with the air. 
 The oxygen of the air combines with the curd, and renders 
 these little sacks, into which it is formed, brittle, so that they 
 crack open, and let out the enclosed globules of butter. 
 These come together forming larger masses, until, if the 
 churning be continued long enough to gather the butter, as it is 
 sometimes called, nearly the whole will be found in one mass. 
 The curd is now nearly separated. It is floating in tho but- 
 termilk. The sugar of milk is diffused through both the but- 
 termilk and the butter, giving a peculiar sweetness to the 
 butter and also tothe buttermilk, if the cream had not become 
 too sour before churning. This is an important considera- 
 tion; for it is this sugar of milk that performs the double 
 office of giving to the butter a luscious flavor, and of causing 
 it to keep well. 

Washed butter may have a tolerable flavor at first, for it 
 will retain a part of the sugar of milk in spite of bad man- 
 agement. But it will have given up to the water too much 
 of its sugar of milk to allow of its keeping for any consider- 
 able time. Put down a firkin of butter that has been wash- 
 ed, and another precisely like it in every other respect, but 
 which has seen no water, let them be from the same churn- 
 ing, be put up in similar firkins, and kept in tho same place, 
 and the unwashed will keep best for an absolute certainty. 
 No more absurd practice ever came into vogue than that of 
 washing butter in floods of water. There is some advantage 
 in washing very rancid butter, for some of its bad properties 
 may be washed out. It may be made tolerable. But if we
