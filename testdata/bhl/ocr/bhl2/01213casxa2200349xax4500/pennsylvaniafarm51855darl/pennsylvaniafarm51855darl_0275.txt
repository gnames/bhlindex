house." Practices so ancient, so good, and never of greater 
 importance to the agriculturist than at the present time, are 
 certainly deserving of being carefully adopted by every prac- 
 tical farmer. 

A large amount of valuable compost may often be obtained 
 by the fermentation of the roots of Triticum repens, that 
 troublesome plant, known in some districts by the name of 
 couch-grass in others as twitch-grass or quicks. In many 
 instances farmers are so improvident as to burn these roots 
 on their land but if they were consulting their own interest 
 they would ferment them, and subsequently use them in com- 
 post-heaps. 

Foreign Substances. — Every description of animal, vege- 
 table, and mineral matters, not generally obtainable on the 
 farm may be comprehended under this head. 

(1.) Blood is a powerful fertiliser, both from the amount 
 of nitrogen and phosphate of soda which it contains. The 
 dry matter of lean flesh and of blood are nearly similar in 
 composition, as will be exhibited in the following table by 
 Dr. Playfair : —

The per-centage of ash in dry flesh is 4.23, and in dry blood 

4.43; the ashes of ox-blood, according to Enderlin, contains 

the following ingredients: — - 

Phosphate of soda, . . . 16.77 

Chloride of sodium (common salt,) 59.34 
 Chloride potassium, . . . 6.12 

Sulphate of soda, . . . 3.85 

Phosphate of lime and magnesia, 4.19 

Oxide and phosphate of iron, . 8.28 

Gypsum and loss, . . . 1.45 

From the quantity of ammonia which is liberated during 
 the decomposition of blood, it should not be applied to the 
 land as it comes from the shambles. The best way to 
 preserve the whole fertilising ingredients is to mix it with 
 soil, clay, peat, and similar matters. By Professor Way's 
 investigation, relative to the absorbing power of soils, we 
 know that, theoretically, this is the safest way to obtain 
 all the fertilising substances present; and practically, such 
 cnclusions have been repeatedly corroborated. The only 
 drawback is, that, as blood contains from 72 to S9 per cent, 
 of water, the removal of larger quantities from the shambles 
 to a distance of several miles may appear more expensive 
 than would in many instances be remunerative. The 
 profitableness of such undertakings must, of course, de- 
 pend very much upon circumstances: but in general, if the 
 blood is got within four or five miles, at a trifling cost, it 
 may be used in compost-heaps with as great profit as any 
 other kind of refuse matter. Applied to cruciferous plants, 
 almost no other description of composts will yield such fine 
 crops. I have also often used a compound manure of this 
 nature for fruit trees and gooseberry bushes, and have found 
 it unequalled by any other substance. 

Professor Johnston tells us that in Northamptonshire, 
 composts are made by mixing about fifty gallons of blood 
 with eight bushels of peat-ashes and charcoal powder. The 
 mixture is then allowed to stand for a year or two, and when 
 applied to light soils, greatly improves the crops. If prop- 
 erly managed, there is no need of so much time being lost; 
 but our remarks on the preparation of such composts will be 
 made after noticingthe other refuse matters of the shambles. 
 A portable manure made from blood is used in France and 
 some parts England. The of blood is evaporated to dryness, 
 and then mixed with some pulverulent substance and sown 

with a drill. In this dry condition it was sold in Paris at 
 8s. per cwt. In London samples containing 22 per cent, of 
 water have been valued £8 or £9 a ton. 

(2.) Flesh and other refuse matters of slaughter-houses are 
 fertilisers of the first order. The ingredients presont in the 
 offal of the shambles cannot be completely represented by the 
 analyses of flesh, but the nitrogenous compounds will be near- 
 ly similar. According to Dr. Playfair, we have seen that 
 ox-flesh contains 15.67 per cent of nitrogen ; and Liebig has 
 shown that flesh contains a much larger quantity of potash 
 than blood, and consequently it deserves especial attention 
 as a manure. Turnbull & Co's prepared ground-flesh ma- 
 nure, in a gritty state, usually contained, according to Dr. 
 Anderson : — 

Water, 

Organic matter, 
 Phosphates, 
 Alkaline salts, 
 Sand, 

12.17 

78.44 
 3.82 
 3.64 
 1.93 

100.000 

Ammonia, 11.20 

From this analysis it is evident that refuse fleshy matters are 
 of great value as fertilisers. 

In 1852, turnips were raised under my chargo with Turn- 
 bull & Co's flesh manure ; and, in contrast to such as were 
 grown with Peruvian guano, they were certainly in no re- 
 spect inferior though produced at a fully less cost. The 
 great matter in the preparation of fleshy tissues for use in the 
 field as manure is to putrify them with substances capable of 
 absorbing the large amount of ammonia given off. If the 
 prepared compost is to be sown with the drill, it is necess- 
 ary to use only such matters as will readily become pulver- 
 ulent. In other cases, any sort of earthy matters, clay, or 
 road-scrapings, will be suitable for securing economical de- 
 composition. In speaking of flesh manures, I may notice 
 the offal of the Edinburgh slaughter-houses. According to 
 the annual returns up to 1st August 1853, it appears that, 
 during the year ending at that date, there were slaughtered 
 of— 

Cattle, .... 20.321 
 Swine, .... 2.970 

Calves, .... 5.763 

Sheep, .... 97.280 

In all, . . 126,334 
 animals, from which, in the form of manure, the following 
 sums were realised: — 

To manure sold, 1338 tons, 16 cwt., 3qrs., 

at 4s. Sd., £312 7 4 

" liquid manure for nine months, . 7 10 

" blood 401 puncheons of 150 gallons each, 

at about 1 l-7d. pe r gallon, . . 2S7 2 

£606 19 4 
 By the number of animals slaughtered during the year, 
 the above sum yields only about one penny and two-thir- 
 teenths per head, a sum which, even considering the large 
 number of sheep included, is very small indeed. To such 
 manures the attention of the farmer cannot be too frequently 
 directed; and though it is his interest to buy as cheap as pos- 
 sible, still it is often bad policy to allow valuabl? fertilisers, 
 like the refuse matters of slaughter-houses, to slip out of his 
 hand for the sake of a few pence on the ton. It is quite ev- 
 ident that the 1338 tons of solid manure, disposed of at the 
 Edinburgh slaughter-houses last year, might have been used 
 on the farm with nearly an equal quantity of earth, peat, or 
 similar matters; and if the mixture had been saturated with 
 blood and liquid manure, it would have been of as great 
 value as the solid offal used alone. Much loss is suffered by
