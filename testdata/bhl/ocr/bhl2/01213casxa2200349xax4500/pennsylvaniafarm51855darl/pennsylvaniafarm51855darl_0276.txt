(3.) Fishery refuse : — In some sea-coast districts, the refuso 
 of fishing stations is of considerable value as manure. 
 Sometimes when shoals of sprats are caught, large quantities 
 are applied to the land. By bad management they are oc- 
 casionally spread on the surface of fields, and not immedi- 
 ately plowed in — a system, in warm weather, as injurious to 
 the health of the neighborhood as it is wasteful on the part 
 of the farmer. If immediately plowed in, scattering the fish 
 over the surface may do very well, but in ordinary circum- 
 stances it is much safer to use them in compost-heaps. The 
 following is the average of two analyses of sprats by Profes- 
 sor Way ; — 

Water, 64.125 

Oil, 19.050 

Dry nitrogenous matter, . . . 16.825 

100.000 
 The dry nitrogenous matter contains, on an average 11.- 
 53 per cent of nitrogen. The mean of two analyses gave 42 
 parts of phosphoric acid and 19.56 of potash in the 100 parts 
 of ash. A very instructive fact has been mentioned by Mr. 
 Way, namely, that the proportion of nitrogen in fish is near- 
 ly the same as in wheat, each having about 2 per cent. He 
 observes; "We know that wheat contains everything that 
 is necessary to support life and increase the animal frame; 
 in other words, is identical, or nearly identical, in composi 
 tion with the body which it nourishes. Sprats, then, may be 
 taken as the type of the animal, wheat as that of the vege- 
 table life : and there can be no doubt of their mutual conver- 
 tibility when placed in the proper circumstances. At Queens- 
 ferry.sprats have been sold for manure at from 3s. to 6s. a 
 cart-load. 

But however valuable they are as a manure, it is question- 
 able whether sprats ought to be caught merely to serve this 
 purpose, as the ultimate effect must be prejudicial to the 
 fisheries. Herring gut, and the offal of cod, ling, and saith 
 fish aroused as manure in many districts in Scotland. On 
 the soi«ih side of the Moray Firth, the fish-curers get about 
 2s. a barrel, or 12s. a cart-load for the refuse. At Wick the 
 price is Is., and at Hemsdale from 3d. to 6d. a barrel. In 
 other instances, the proprietor of the estate on which the 
 fishing station is situated claims the refuse without price. 
 The way to prepare such fish-refuse in the field, is to form 
 a layer of earth, peat, or other bibulous matter, 6 or 8 inches 
 thick, as a beginning to a compost-heap. Over this should 
 then be spread a layer of the refuse about 2 inches thick, and 
 above it another coating of earthy or peaty matter from 4 to 
 6 inches in thickness, then over the mass a suitable quantity 
 of fish-brine or dissolved salt should be poured. Another 
 layer of fish, earth and brine follows in regular alternation 
 till the heap is of sufficient height. After being allowed to 
 putrefy for a month or six weeks, more or less according to 
 the nature of the weather, the compound should be turned, 
 and in a week or two applied to the land. Of course, while 
 salt is necessary to prevent the fish-refuse from being entire- 
 ly consumed by maggots, care must also be taken not to use 
 more than is necessary to serve this purpose. It has been 
 said that sometimes heaps of fishery-refuse have literally rnn 
 away through the millions of maggots that have been bred 
 in them. In numerous instances, however, by an over- 
 abundant, use of brine, cereals have refued to grow tho first 
 application. When properly prepared, fish-composts are pre- 
 eminently adapted for promoting the growth of cereals. 
 Mr. Methven, the fish-curer in Leith, mentions a case which 
 came under his notice in the year 1S20, at one of the north- 

ern fisherj' stations. A poor of piece land, which never pro- 
 duced oats more than from IS to 20 inches in height, was 
 dressedwith some sorts of compost containing a considerable 
 proportion of putrid fish matter; the followiug year the crop 
 was uniformly from 4 to 4A feet in height, and the yield was 
 highly remunerative. Composts prepared in the way nlready 
 mentioned, and used in conjunction with farmyard dung, 
 are well adapted for the production of turnips or other green 
 crops on ordinary soils, but applied alone the action is to 
 evanescent to serve a whole rotation. From the fact that 
 guano is only the digested dried remains of fish, we may at 
 once see the propriety of carefully saving every description 
 of fishery refuse for use on our fields. 

Notes on Pears last Season. 

BY JOHN B. EATON, BUFFALO, N. Y. 

In fulfillment of my promise, I send you some brief notes 
 of my experience with Pears. Most of the varieties were 
 fruited upon young trees, many of which were bearing their 
 first crop. This should not of course be taken as an infalli- 
 ble test of their future excellence or inferiority, although 
 the land upon which the greater part were grown was deep- 
 ly cultivated and well supplied with manure, with which the 
 trees were also mulched. As a consequence of these precau- 
 tions, the extraordinarily dry season, which so greatly de- 
 creased the produce (both in size and quality) of many plan- 
 tations, did not, as a general thing, reduce the size of our 
 specimens, and we grew Duchesse d' Angouleme, Beurre Diet, 
 Louise Sonne de Jersey, and many others, to a size which I 
 have rarelv, if ever, seen exceeded. 

The blight has destroyed a few trees the past season, but 
 has not prevailed as an epidemic, and is, I think, gradually 
 leaving us. Timely amputation of the affected part has 
 saved a portion of those trees which were first attacked in 
 the branches; but the remedy, to answer any good purpose, 
 must be applied without hesitation, and severely — cutting 
 far below any appearance of disease, otherwise the diseased 
 sap will have poisoned the lower part of the branch before 
 the application of the knife. 

Nearly all of the varieties were fruited on the quince 
 stock. A few, which will be specified, were from standards. 

Ananas d' Ete is a handsome pear of a somewhat elonga- 
 ted obovate form, of good size, bnt wanting in flavor. Our 
 specimens may have been picked too early, but their quality 
 sadly disappointed me. Ripe from the first to the middle of 
 September. 

Beurre Gonbault — medium in size, roundish, not very but- 
 tery, but "very good." An apparently profuse bearer, but 
 wanting color. Middle of September. 

Bloodgood, although not much spoken of among so many 
 new varieties, is one of my especial favorites among the 
 early pears. Its peculiar aromatic flavor has few counter- 
 parts, but I find it a little uncertain in size, and does not 
 grow very well on quince, even when double worked. 
 "Very good." September. 

Beurre d' Amalis is a large, showy fruit, although not well 
 colored, and a great bearer on tho quince. Still, I would 
 not cultivate it unless for market, and consider it no better 
 than "good." September. 

Bartlett needs no description. Our specimens were very 
 fine — rather better from dwarfs than standards; but the 
 quality of the fruit is so far below its appearance, that I 
 am always a little disappointed, in spite of myself, on eat- 
 ing one. " Good." First to middle of September. 

Beurre de Paim])al is a pale green, ungainly-looking fruit, 
 not unlike the Verte Longue, with which it may be identical. 
 It is too indifferent, however, to cause much anxiety as to 
 what kind it is. September.
