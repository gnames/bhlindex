Figure 1 is a vertical section of the machine, and 
 figure 2 is a horizontal section of the stationary and re- 
 volving smut cylindei's. Similar letters refer to like parts- 

A is a frame which supports the several parts of the 
 machine ; B is a fan box placed directly under a plat- 
 form, a, of the frame, and C is a curved trunk, one end 
 of which commences near the bottom of one side of the 
 fan box, and passes upward and forms a curve and 
 descends at the bottom of the fan box opposite to the 
 side first mentioned. D is the fan placed within the 
 fan box B, and hung upon a vertical shaft, E. On the 
 lower part of the shaft, E, there is a pulley, F; the 
 shaft, E, extends upward through an air tight box, G, 
 which is placed on the upper part of the platform di- 
 rectly above the fan box, B. The box, G, communi- 
 cates with the trunk, C, by means of a horizontal pas- 
 sage, H. This passage also communicates with the 
 fan box, B. On the shaft, E, and within the box, G, 
 there is placed a cylinder, I, which is formed of a series 
 of flat metal bars, b, secured vertically to top and bot- 
 tom heads, c c. These bars are so attached to the 
 heads, c c, as to overlap each other, and the outer edges 
 of the bars in an operating machine, may be about half 
 an inch distant from each other, the space between the 
 bars being sufiiciently small to prevent grain from pass- 
 ing through, but at the same time admitting a current 
 of air. Around the cylinder, I, and within the box, G, 
 there is a stationary cylinder, J, constructed precisely 
 similar to the cylinder, I, with the exception that the 
 bars b. may be placed closer together, so that the spaces 
 between them are not more than one-sixteenth of an 
 inch apart. The space between the two cylinders, I J, 
 may be about half an inch, and from this space a spout, 
 K, leads into the trunk, C ; L is a valve at the upper 
 part of the trunk, C. At the upper part of the box, G, 
 there is an opening, d, through which the grain is ad- 
 mitted into the space between the two cylinders, I J- 

Operation. — Motion is given the fan, D, and the 
 cylinder, I, by means of a belt passing around a pulley, 
 F, and the grain to be cleansed is poured into the space 
 between the two cylinders, I J, through the opening, d, we think it always ought to be, and we do not care how 
 as the cylinder, I, rotates, the smut is scoured from, the I deep, this previous combination with plaster, charcoal, 

grain, and pulverized or broken by means of the edges 
 of the bars, b, which give a corrugated surface to the 
 cylinders. The fan, D, causes a current of air to pass 
 through the trunk, as indicated by arrows, 2, the grain 
 indicated by arrows, 1, passes from the cylinders down 
 the spout, K, into the trunk, C, where it is subjected to 
 the blast which carries upward in the trunk, the smut, 
 dirt, chess, etc., indicated by arrows, 3, and the grain 
 separated from impurities falls from the trunk. Certain 
 portions of the smut and dirt also pass through the 
 cylinder, I, and is drawn down into the fan box, B, by 
 the action of the fan, and forced out a passage repre- 
 sented by e at the side of the fan box. The portions 
 of smut, dirt, chess, etc., that followed the grain into 
 the trunk, are carried over the curve at the upper part 
 of the trunk, and the smut, dirt, and light particles are 
 drawn into the fan box, B, at the connection of the 
 passage, H, with the trunk, while the heavier substan- 
 ces of some value, such as chess, light grain, etc., see 
 arrows 2, will resist the power of the current, and fall 
 from the spout at the end opposite to that from which 
 the perfect grain passed. By regulating the valve, L, 
 at the upper part of the trunk, C, the blast or current 
 within said trunk may be increased or diminished, as 
 desired. 

This valve is to obviate any evil from excess of fan 
 motion; it is self-adjusting, and opens by outside atmos- 
 pheric pressure, and suction draft along the trunk, C, 
 so that when the blast is too strong, and carries over 
 wheat, by giving the movable screw weight on the end 
 of the lever of the valve, L, a few turns, it is brought 
 nearer the valve, and allows of its being opened by ex- 
 cess of blast, to prevent the wheat being carried over.

Mode of using Guano. 
 Should Guano be ploughed or harrowed in ? Should 
 it be mixed with plaster, previous to sowing, or spread 
 by itself? These are matters on which a difference of 
 opinion exists among practical farmers, resulting we 
 think partly from the different circumstances under 
 which experiments have been made. 

We have known three hundred pounds of Guano ap- 
 plied to the surface of grass lands, with the happiest 
 results, but the benefit was owing to its being sown 
 immediately preceding a fall of rain, or subsequent 
 spell of wet weather. This, with the consequent rapid 
 growth of grass, prevented the loss of its ammoniacal 
 constituents by evaporation and exposure. Still we 
 would not from such an experiment say, that Guano 
 should always be spread on the surface. 

For the same reason, simply harrowing it in is often suf- 
 ficient, particularly in heavy or retentive soils ; but we 
 would recommend whenever it is thus covered, or spread 
 on the surface, it should previously be mixed with plas- 
 ter, one part of plaster to two of Guano. The sulphur- 
 ic acid of the plaster, uniting with the ammonia of the 
 Guano, forms the non volatile sulphate of ammonia, 
 which if not so immediately active remains longer in 
 the soil, and produces more lasting and permanent 
 benefit.
