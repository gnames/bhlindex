ards and casualties. 4. They demand less attention, as 
 one ox-herd can take care of 80 oxen, if others work 
 with them by change. Finally, they give a greater 
 quantity of excrement, -which in general affords a more 
 productive manure than that of horses. Such horses 
 and oxen must be compared, the relation of which in 
 respect to their condition and care, are not unlike, &c. 
 There can, therefore, be no doubt, that those labours 
 which can be proportionally well performed by oxen, 
 will be done cheaper with oxen than with horses. If a 
 farm had only such work to be done as is convenient for 
 oxen, and it could be executed with allowing time to rest, 
 &c, then oxen should be used. But if, according to re- 
 cent experiments, another fodder can be introduced for 
 horses than corn, and thus the expense be lessened, then 
 the question between horses and oxen would probably 
 stand differently." — Rural Cyclopedia. 

The Hessian Fly and the Midge. 

[The following brief but comprehensive article by 
 Prof. Dewey embraces a very succinct account of these 
 insects. As the subject is, just now, one of great inter- 
 est to thousands of rural readers, we give the article 
 the prominence to which it is entitled. — Ed. R. N. Y.] 

Both these insects have attracted much interest for a 
 few weeks past, as they are voracious destroyers of 
 wheat. Much effort has been necessary to ascertain 
 satisfactorily the history of these depredators on one 
 great necessary of life. It seems to be proved that 
 they are old and well-known insects of Europe, and 
 have the same character there and here. 

The Hessian fly was introduced into our country in 
 1776, by the Hessian troops who were landed on Long 
 Island. In a few years their depredations on wheat 
 fields were obvious, and have been well known since, 
 till the insect has spread far and wide over the land. 
 The Hessian Fly lays it eggs near the root of the wheat 
 in autumn, and the maggot which soon is hatched, takes 
 its residence just above the lower joint of the stalk, 
 causing it to enlarge and yield its nutritious juice to the 
 animal. Though the stalk grows in the spring, it is 
 sickly, becomes weak and wrinkles down, and bears no 
 fruit. In due time the maggot becomes a chrysalis, 
 like a flax seed, and changes into a fly, whose body is 
 about one-tenth of an inch long, and whose wings expand 
 about a fourth of an inch. So small and insignificant 
 is the animal, which is produced in such multitudes as 
 to blast the harvest hopes of the husbandman entirely, 
 and expose him to the desolation of a famine. Several 
 destroyers of the maggot are provided by a kind Provi- 
 dence, by which the creature is destroyed, and the field 
 of wheat is left uninjured. It is said that two crops of 
 this insect are produced in a year. 

The Hessian Fly belongs to the order Diptera, or two- 
 winged, and has the very musical and expressive name 
 of Cecidomyia destructor the destructive gall-fly. The 
 common name, Hessian Fly, is its accepted designation. 

The Midge, or Wheat Gnat, is another insect, destruc- 
 tive to wheat. It has the name of Cecidomyia tritici, 
 meaning gall-fly of wheat. This also is a small insect, 
 about the size of the Hessian Fly, and often appears in 
 great numbers on the heads of wheat. Its object there 
 is, to lay its eggs at and upon the young seed or wheat. 

These they soon hatch into a maggot, which devours the 
 seed and cuts off the crop. In due time, the nuiggot 
 becomes transformed into a yellow chrysalis, falls to 
 the ground and lies until the next season, and then the 
 shell is burst, and the midge or gall-gnat flies forth to 
 its work of propagation. The destruction falls directly 
 on the seed in the head of wheat, and the yellow chrys- 
 alis or pupa is to be seen at and before harvesting in 
 the wheat heads. The maggot is not able to eat through 
 the hard covering of the wheat seed, and cannot attack 
 ripe wheat ; and hence its destructive power operates 
 before the milk changes into a solid form. 

This Midge is often called the "Weevil," but this is 
 an improper naming. The weevil belongs to another 
 family of insects, of beetle kind, and is able to eat ripe 
 and hard grains. The "rice-weevil" is one of the kind, 
 named Calandra oryzce, which eats the ripened and hard 
 rice, and also devours "stored" Indian corn. It is said 
 that a similar weevil has been found to eat the hard 
 seed of wheat, but too little is known of it or its ravages 
 to be of importance now. At any rate, they are very dif- 
 ferent from the Midge, now in the heads of wheat. It 
 is desirable to use as definite names in common lan- 
 guage as possible. Hence the names above. To call 
 one the wheat fly, marks no difference, for both are flies 
 or gnats, and both destroy wheat. The Hessian Fly 
 might be named "Wheat-Stalk Fly," and the Midge, 
 "Wheat-Head Fly," to designate an important fact and 
 difference. C. D. — Rural Neiu Yorker. 

More Evidence in Favor of Gas Lime. 

Mr. Editor: — My limited experience, in the use of 
 refuse lime from gas works, as a manure, is much more 
 in accordance with Mr. Maxwell's views than yours, and 
 for the following reasons. 

In the spring of 1853, a lot in this vicinity was filled 
 up some two feet or more, with earth from a hill side, 
 and was covered with grass sods, without any soil or 
 manure of any kind, being put beneath them — the grass 
 was watered occasionally, during the dry hot season, but 
 presented a very sickly appearance. 

In the autumn of that year, it was covered with refuse 
 lime from the gas works, and during last summer, it pro- 
 duced a most luxuriant growth of green grass, [Poa pra- 
 tensis] and now, without any other application, is as 
 pretty a sod, as any one need wish to see. 

In consequence of this experiment, I covered my own 
 grounds, last fall with it, and notwithstanding the cold 
 backward season, I had on the 14th inst., a stout swarth 
 taken from them, the grass being of a much deeper, and 
 more healthy green than heretofore. I have also tried 
 it in compost, with sufficient encouragement to repeat 
 the trial, but it is more difficult, to form a correct judge- 
 ment of its effect when combined with other manures, 
 than when it is applied per se. 

I have seen no analysis of the refuse lime, produced 
 by the gas works at this place, but that it does contain, 
 as suggested by the Agriculturist, a large per centage of 
 caustic lime, (hydrate) I think may be shown, by stating 
 the process adopted at the works. I am told the custom 
 is, to remove the lime, many hours before it is saturated, 
 with the impurities it is intended to arrest. Is not the 
 effect of this, to leave a large per centage not saturated,
