and consequently caustic. Again, according to Prof. 
 Johnson's analysis, as quoted by Mr. Maxwell, more than 
 one-half is carbonate of lime, about one-fifth is sulphate 
 of lime, and three per cent, alumina and oxide of iron, 
 here then we have about seventy-five per cent, of vege- 
 table stimulants. I think it probable that much of the 
 caustic or kiln lime, used as a manure by our farmers, 
 does not contain much more of the essential stimulants, 
 than this sample. 

The transition limestone, that abounds in this vicinity, 
 contains, in some localities, thirty-six per cent, of impu- 
 rities, chiefly magnesia, which is obnoxious to vegetation. 
 Now as I presume they use stone lime in the gas works 
 at Toronto, may not the samples, used by the intelligent 
 gentleman of whom you speak, have been of this char- 
 acter, and not rendered worthless comparatively, by 
 passing through the gas works. 

The sample analysed by Prof. Johnson, as quoted by 
 you, must necessarily have contained a large excess of 
 water, as it is used by the gas manufacturers, in the 
 form of hydrate, otherwise it would not have been one- 
 half water. 

The mode of managing the lime here, I believe, is, to 
 put it under cover after it has been used in the purifica- 
 tion, and allow any excess of water it may contain to 
 pass off, and so great is the demand for it, that the orders 
 from the farmers are sometimes many months in advance 
 of the supply, and so fully are they convinced of its 
 value, that they pay six and a fourth cents per bushel, 
 and haul it five or six miles, when they can purchase 
 the fresh or kiln lime for ten or twelve cents. 

As an evidence, that they are not behind their neigh- 
 bours in the proper management of their farms, their 
 beef is much sought after, and commands the highest 
 price in the metropolis of New York, as their butter 
 does in the cities of Baltimore and Washington, this I 
 have heard them attribute to the superior pasture afford- 
 ed by the green grass, the growth of which appears to 
 be much promoted by this '-vile refuse which should be 
 buried many fathoms deep, in some barren region." Let 
 us not, Mr. Editor, condemn it nolens volens as Dr. Ure 
 appears to have done, but give it a fair and impartial 
 trial, and if it should then be found to be worthless, re- 
 ject it, and "strike it from the list that promises well."

 There is no profession more important than that of 
 Agriculture. On the skilful preparation of the soil de- 
 pends its productiveness, the riches of States, the pros- 
 perity of commerce, and the welfare and development of 
 nations. Agriculture, in common with other branches of 
 art, may be practised without any philosophical knowl- 
 edge of its theory; established practices may be imitated, 
 and the ordinary routine of operations about a farm may 
 be conducted with the usual results. Under such cir- 
 cumstances the progress of improvement must however 
 necessarily be very slow. The mere routine practitioner 
 has no resources in cases of difficulty but ordinary expe- 
 dients, and if these should fail him is compelled to desist 

from any further attempt; for efforts made at random 
 without that discrimination which a scientific knowledge ■ 
 of the subject imparts are of little avail. It is other- 
 wise with the man of science who referring effects to 
 their true causes, at once skilfully selects the appro- 
 priate measures, when the usual plan does not succeed. 
 He exercises not only his muscle but his intellect, and is 
 thus able to bring about those results which are desira- 
 ble, in cases where his less philosophical neighbor en- 
 counters difficulties which are absolutely insurmountable. 

If the farmer would obtain the greatest possible yield 
 from his land, he must endeavor to find out the causes 
 which produce the various effects, with which experience 
 has rendered him familliar. It is not sufficient that he 
 acquires a knowledge of the facts connected with the 
 various agricultural operations about his grounds, he 
 must study their philosophy, and for this purpose a 
 knowledge of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, and 
 the different branches of Natural History, especially 
 Botany, must be acquired. 

Vegetables are in fact the most important product of 
 the farm. On their skilful cultivation every thing else 
 depends, whether we consider them as food for man or 
 domestic animals. Is it not important that the Agricul- 
 turist should be able to distinguish scientifically the use- 
 ful from the hurtful plants growing on his farm, so as to 
 be able the most effectually to promote the growth of the 
 former and to extirpate the latter? To this end some 
 notions of botany are absolutely indispensable. 

If we plant a seed in the ground, it grows from the 
 very commencement of vital motion in two opposite di- 
 rections, upwards into the atmosphere and downwards 
 into the earth ; the two grand sources from whence it 
 obtains the materials which contribute to its future 
 growth. We may consider a plant then as a vegetable 
 axis or stem, more or less ramified at its two extremities. 
 That portion of the stem growing into the atmosphere puts 
 forth from its branches during the season of vegetable 
 activity certain flat, dilated organs, which we call leaves, 
 the surface of which is porous and by means of which 
 food is absorbed from the atmosphere. That portion of 
 the stem w T hich ramifies in the ground, on the other hand, 
 becomes covered about the same time with numberless 
 delicate white fibres, which are the true roots of the 
 plant. These correspond to the leaves on the branches, 
 performing the same function, that of absorption, and 
 like the leaves decay and become detached from the 
 plant in autumn. On the return of spring, the under- 
 ground and atmospheric ramifications of the plant are 
 again re-clothed, the former with fibres and the latter 
 with leaves. 

It is a mistake to suppose that all the underground 
 portion of a plant is the root. The white delicate fibres 
 put forth in early spring at the time that the leaves 
 grow on the branches in the atmosphere are the true 
 roots; they contribute to the extension of the subterra- 
 nean branches by the food which they absorb from the 
 soil, exactly as the leaves induce a growth of the branches 
 in the atmosphere by exercising the same function. A 
 fibre and a leaf are wonderfully different in form and 
 color, yet both are absorbents, beautifully adapted to the 
 media in which they develop. 

The farmer will now see the propriety of transplanting
