quiry as to the cause of the choking, the machine was 
 backed, and a fresh start taken. The whip was again 
 applied to the already restive horses, and the mower 
 with its dull knives, unoiled journals, &c, was brought 
 up against the heavy standing grass with all the impetus 
 which two powerful horses could give to it. It is scarce- 
 ly necessary to state the result. The eye by which the 
 knife is connected with the pitman rod gave way, and fur- 
 ther operations were stopped until it could be repaired. 
 Now this was only the first trial. A second and third 
 succeeded, with the same preliminaries, and of course 
 with the same results, and the finale of the whole matter 
 was, that the mower was returned to the manufacturer, 
 broken and worthless, with the announcement from the 
 purchaser that it was not worth a cent; that the bolts 
 were good for nothing and that the whole machine was 
 a humbug. 

Is it to be wondered at, that in the hands of such men, 
 machines fail, and manufacturers lose reputation, I 
 have known instances in which just such men have pur- 
 chased mowing machines, started them in the same man- 
 ner and thrown them aside as worthless. At the close 
 of the season, they sold them for less than one-third 
 their original cost. And I have seen these same ma- 
 chines in the hands of their new purchasers, without 
 any alterations other than repairs of breakage, made to 
 work in the most satisfactory manner. 

With such facts and many others of a similar character 
 before us, there is little need of the inquiry which I pur- 
 posed propounding. The question is answered before it 
 is asked, and the moral of the whole matter is, that far- 
 mers as a general thing are not sufficiently careful in the 
 use of their farm machinery. That manufacturers are 
 frequently to blame I admit, but it is very apparent that 
 much vexation, trouble and expense would be saved the 
 purchaser if in the first starting of machines, he would 
 see that every nut was well drawn and every working 
 part well oiled, and (where knives formed a part of the 
 machine) the edges were well whetted.

A Word in Defence of Italian Rye Grass. 

Mr. J. L. Darlington : — In the July "Farm Jour- 
 nal," Mr. John W. Gibbons has an article devoted 
 principally to denouncing the famous Italian Rye Grass ; 
 one of the most popular grasses in Great Britain and 
 Ireland; and I might say universally considered (he best! 

Now this Mr. G. must have been sadly imposed upon, 
 or else he is unreasonably ignorant of the subject on 
 which he writes. This grass is well known to be the 
 sweetest and best, either for pasturage or hay, to be 
 found — cattle of all kinds prefer it to any other variety. 

I will give you a few noted facts concerning it, where 
 it was grown on my father's farm, of late years, to the 
 exclusion of all other kinds. The first experiment was 
 made with a small quantity of seed, which partly sowed 
 a field, the balance, (about one half), being sowed with 
 clover. Early the following year a heavy crop of hay 
 was taken off, and in the course of two weeks the cat- 
 tle (about ten head), were turned into a luxuriant sec- 
 ond gi-owth. On this they feasted, and continued to do 
 so until it was cropped as "bare as your hand" — not the 
 clover my dear sir, but the Italian Eye Grass ; and that 

alone did they eat as long as they could collect a mouth- 
 full ! The fact soon became notorious in the neighbor- 
 hood, and the demand for seed was without a parallel. 
 Another fact. — A field of bottom land yielded four 
 heavy cuttings of hay! — two of which were ripened for 
 the sake of getting the seed. The fifth crop, into which 
 the cattle were turned, would have yielded another good 
 crop of hay ; and all these five cuttings in one season, 
 without anything more than ordinary labor. I could 
 cite other facts in favor of this valuable variety of 
 grass, but I think further remarks unnecessary. 

I would be gratified to hear from some of our friends, 
 who have experimented with the Italian Rye grass in 
 this climate, relative to their success or failure. Your 
 correspondent who is an ardent admirer of the noble 
 agricultural science, has not a rod of ground to culti- 
 vate, or he would certainly test its value.

Oiketicus. 

J. L. Darlington Esq. : — Dear Sir : — The insects 
 you had the goodness to leave at my office on the 3rd 
 inst., are the larvae of a moth belonging to the Genus 
 Oiketicus; you doubtless have observed the Cocoons of 
 these insects hanging by dozens on almost all kinds of 
 fruit and shade trees during the winter and spring 
 months; they are much more abundant now than they 
 were formerly in this section of the country. I have 
 marked with regret their steady increase for the last fif- 
 teen years. These caterpillars belong to a family of 
 moths, called Psychada; the caterpillars of which feed 
 on the leaves of trees and shrubs, and conceal themselves 
 in oval silken cocoons covered on the outside by bits of 
 sticks or leaves ; the insect never leaves his domicil, but 
 bears it about with it as a defence or concealment from 
 enemies; from this peculiarity they have received the 
 name of Sack-bearers and Basket- carriers from the 
 shape and appearance of the cocoons of the different 
 species. These caterpillars when about to undergo their 
 metamorphis, attach one end of their cocoon by a web 
 of silk to a twig, while the other end is free and but 
 slightly closed to admit of the more ready exit of the 
 moth. The female is wingless, and deposits her eggs 
 before leaving the cocoon, and in many instances when 
 I have examined the cocoons the females had died within 
 them after having deposited a vast number of small 
 green eggs ; according to some writers the females of 
 this genus produce fertile eggs without fecundation. 

I will but add that you can easily rid your trees of the 
 cocoons during the winter and spring months by means 
 of a spring knife and rope fastened to a long pole, taking 
 care to burn them when gathered. For a more detailed 
 account of the habits and transformation of this family 
 of moths, I refer you to the excellent treatise of Dr. 
 Harris. Yours, respectfully, W. D. HARTMAN.

 Mr. J. L. Darlinglon: — Dear Sir: — I hereby send 
 you one dollar for the Farm Journal, and desire you to 
 send me the July No. if you have any on hand. I would 
 have forwarded it sooner, but was in hopes that a club 
 would have been raised at this office. The folks hero
