have but little faith in Agricultural papers; some of 
 them will not even read them, let alone pay for them ; 
 and nearly every one believes in the transmutation of 
 plants, such as that wheat and barley will turn to cheat; 
 cheat turn to timothy; spring barley turn to oats, &c. ; 
 you will not now be surprised that they do not take the 
 Farm Journal. If I had time I should like to let you 
 know how we do up farming here, and account for the 
 ••freaks of nature" as we mostly call them. However, 
 we have got along pretty well so far this year. Crops 
 very good; wheat as good as I ever saw; rye the best 
 of all, more sown than has been for the last five years; 
 and put all together. I could send you a bunch of it, the 
 product of one grain, numbering fifty-seven stalks, aver- 
 aging sixty grains to the stalk ; corn, more planted than 
 usual, looks very good ; oats and barley, one-half down 
 flat, and hard to cut; grass, good; fruit of all kinds 
 abundant and of extra quality. I am afraid my com- 
 munication will weary you. Yours, SAM'L. MELONEY.

CtflCUS ARVENSIS.— CANADA THISTLE. 

Some time since, a correspondent desired to know the 
 peculiar appearance of the Canada Thistle, inasmuch as 
 never having seen the plant, he could not be sure of 
 recognizing it when he should see it. That is a happy 

ignorance, and he may congratulate himself if it shall 
 forever continue. There are people and things in this 
 world with whom acquaintance is not desirable, and the 
 Canada Thistle may be safely reckoned as one of them. 

Nevertheless it may be of consequence to know how 
 the thing would look were we to see it, especialry if 
 there is danger that at some time we may, against our 
 will, be introduced to it. With such a notion we intro- 
 duce to our readers this old pest of Vermont and the 
 Genessee Valley of New York. 

It is not a worse looking thistle than many others. 
 Taken individually, it is not worse and would it be con- 
 tent to grow by itself, now and then a plant here and 
 there about the wayside, and up and down in neglected 
 fields, it might be safe to despise and let it alone. But 
 it is too ambitious a plant for that. It must grow every- 
 where. It must fill all the fields into which it can get 
 a foothold. It must overrun the pasture ; it must fill 
 the meadow ; it will overtop the oats ; it will contest 
 supremacy with the rye ; it will fight for equality with 
 the corn ; it must be everywhere like David Jones' yel- 
 low dog, and everywhere it must be disagreeable. It 
 is as hateful as a Madura hedge and nowhere as beau- 
 tiful, and not by a thousand times as safe ; and as to 
 use, it has none whatever. You cannot touch it or be 
 among it with either comfort or safety. Green or dry, 
 dead or alive, it is the same uncomfortable enemy. 

The Canada Thistle is propagated in two ways. First 
 it spreads by stolons, that is, it puts out runners just 
 like a strawberry plant, with the difference that the 
 thistle runners run underground ; and every now and 
 then a root is put down ; and where the root goes down, 
 a stalk springs up. This goes on indefinitely, and yon 
 can never be sure you have eradicated the plant till you 
 know you have destroyed all those stolons or infant 
 roots, for though you kill the old plant, the young ones 
 may have got a foothold, and will grow in spite of it. 
 Next, it propagates by seed. This is matured in boun- 
 tiful quantities, and each seed is provided with a kina 
 of balloon apparatus like any other thistle seed, or like 
 that of the Dandelion, by which it is buoyed up in the 
 air and floats about wherever the wind carries it, till it 
 gets tired of floating or its parachutes get broken. A 
 few plants therefore will seed a neighborhood; a neigh- 
 borhood will seed a district, and a district will seed a 
 State. 

It is a dreadfully accommodating plant, that is, it ac- 
 commodates itself wonderfully. Give it a good clean 
 soil, and it will grow up thick, stout, straight and tall, 
 like a parcel of fire or horse weeds. Keep it in the 
 grass, and it will trail modestly about, with a few crook- 
 ed and struggling stems, as if it deemed itself unworthy 
 to live but with the violets or other paragons of modes- 
 ty. It is as we say here in the west, "all kinds of a 
 plant. 

Friends, do you want it on your farm ? If you do. 
 neglect it. You need not desire it, you do not need to 
 run after it; it will come to you xery likely, and once 
 with you it ivill stay, however bad you wish it were 
 gone ; provided you do not root it out, by the most de- 
 termined and energetic action. The first plant of it 
 must be dug up and kept dug up, the thing being done 
 ten times in a season if needs be. It cannot live if it
