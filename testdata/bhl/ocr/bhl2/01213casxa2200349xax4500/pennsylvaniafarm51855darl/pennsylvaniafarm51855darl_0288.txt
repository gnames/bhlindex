 heretofore. This will give them an opportunity of sub- 
 dividing -when the duties are onerous, and greatly 
 abridge their labors of examination and decision. 

State Fair Committees at Powelton. 

Mr. Darlington: — I will never serve on another Com- 
 mittee "that's flat," especially as a substitute. I was de- 
 coyed on to a Committee at the State Fair; over persuaded 
 I ought to say by such arguments as, "not much to do," 
 honor to be acquired, silk badge with Judge in big letters 
 to stick in a button hole; free dinner ticket, &c. There were 
 other arguments of a more spiritual nature used, such as 
 demijohns of brandy, boxes of Champaign e, bottles of Madeira 
 wine, <tc, glistening in a row under the Judge's table. Being 
 a temperance man they were lost on me, but I have no doubt 
 had their influence in leading many a poor substitute into 
 the same forlorn situation with myself. All seemed to go 
 on well for a time ; exhibitors were all smiles and compli- 
 ments; it was Judge here, and Judge there; "make room 
 for the Judges," &c, &c. ; common humanity had to stand 
 out of the way, and looked very small when they got there. 
 But when the premiums were awarded, "presto change" I "the 
 adversary was to pay and no extract of pine hot"; we soon 
 found we had waked up eleven wrong passengers and only 
 one right one, and he happened to be the one that received 
 the premium. We sneaked off leaving all the honor and 
 some of the liquor on the ground, hoping that "out of sight 
 out of mind," but we were sorely mistaken; the storm fol- 
 lowed us to our own quiet homes; and I am now convinced, 
 3 T ou, Mr. Editor, were the first to see it, for I now recollect 
 you tried to excuse us by the plea of having too much to do, 
 but your kind intentions were of no avail; on our devoted 
 heads it must be poured. 

First came T. W. asking "why do committees award pre- 
 miums to machines and implements which are good for 
 nothing?" Now then, Mr. Editor, is a question to answer; 
 if I knew which rejected implement T. W. claimed, I would 
 get the committee together and award him a gold medal out 
 of my own pocket rather than attempt to answer it; but all 
 this we might bear being in company with so large a num- 
 ber of gentlemen selected by the Executive Committee of the 
 Agricultural Society of the great state of Pennsylvania. But 
 up starts three more letters of the alphabet, X. P. Q. (by the 
 way Mr. Editor, I begin to feel like the apple pie, that B 
 bit, C cut, &c, the only difference being that in the present 
 attack the alphabet seems to be coming tail foremost) and 
 cuts me, "and a few more of the same sort" from even tho 
 consolation of suffering in good company. Now listen, and 
 if you can think of any arguments in favor of suicide, send 
 to my address by next maiL 

"The committee on implements at the State Fair were 
 originally composed of gentlemen selected on account of their 
 presumed capacity for the duties assigned them; but in many 
 instances they failed to appear, and their places were hastily 
 filled by wen wholly incompetent." Now, we poor devils of sub- 
 stitutes might bear the skinning if ho would only use a sharp 
 knife and stop when tho hide was off; but just listen to the 
 way "he piles up the agony." — "It is to be hoped hereafter 
 that the Executive Committee will subdivide the committees 
 that not more than an hour or two need be consumed by 
 each; then competent gentlemen will not hesitate to act." 
 Now why did he not send this to us before he published it? 
 We would have bought a patent egg-breaker, hen's-nest, or 
 any other rejected article he might have on hand at any 
 price, rather than be thus exposed. He seems to think we 
 could not be openly bribed like the State Legislature (com- 
 plimentary to the solons rather,) but insinuates snares were 

laid fur us. Now a man, gentleman (I should say) of his 
 capacity should have known that fear is often more potent 
 than money or snares, and his communication presented at 
 our heads would, like the ball from a minnio rifle, havo 
 brought us down at any distance. 

But let us continue to quote from this wise man (I ask his 
 pardon) gentleman of the east. — "I passed from machino to 
 machine comparing the merits of each, thus forming my own 
 judgement, or when preconceived opinions existed, correc- 
 ting, changing or confirming them, either by closer scrutiny, 
 or interchange of ideas with others of similar tastes with my 
 own, whom I met on the ground. Thus / became pretty 
 intimately acquainted with nearly all tho implements (A 
 value, formed my own conclusions as to their respective and 
 comparative merits, and awaited the published awards with 
 some little curiosity. I need not say Mr. Editor, the conceit 
 was taken out of me; machines to which I would hardly 
 have given shelter were dignified by Silver Medals; and 
 others of third or fourth rate value were assigned first pre- 
 miums." 

Now, "ther's richness" for you! If the State Society 
 "wishes to reward merit" let them do it. Merry Sir John, 
 says, "men of merit are sought after," but if so they are not 
 easily found, or such an admirable Creighton would not have 
 had to hollow "hoop" so loudly. Talk about dividing commit- 
 tees ! why here is a gentleman that resolved himself into a 
 glorious committee of one, and for mere pastime performed 
 tho duties of all your committees united; and porformed 
 them just four times as well, for they awarded first premiums 
 to articles that only stood as No. 4 on his list. Much as I 
 suffer I cannot help feeling proud of such a countryman. 

I once lived in Delaware County, but the present inhabi- 
 tants {gentlemen I mean,) must be giants, compared with the 
 men I knew. If we had two more such gentlemen, one to 
 report on all the live stock, and another to attend to the 
 plowing match, the whole business could be arranged at 
 Harrisburg next fall in the most satisfactory manner. 

But there is one thing he complains of that I had like to - : 
 have forgotten. He says our report "took tho conceit out of 
 him", well it could not have been of much consequence, as 
 it did not stay out long, and if it hurt him in coming or re- 
 turning, he deserved it for not sending us his report that we 
 might copy it, and not have exposed our weakness to the 
 scorn of the world. It must have been an interesting sight 
 to see the "conceit coming out of him." I have often tried 
 to imagine it but could not think of any comparison but the 
 sticking a knife into a hoven bullock, (I suppose because I 
 am a grazier,) but I hope the gentleman will not for a 
 moment suppose I imagined the gas to have the same bad 
 odour; I was only thinking of the instantaneous collapse 
 and the great relief the poor puffed up animal seemed to 
 feel. A Substitute for a Gentleman. 

It is proper we should state that T. W. exhibited no im- 
 plements at the State Exhibition. — Ed.

Committees at the next Pennsylvania State Fair. 

Mr. Editor: — Great complaints were made (and not 
 without sufficient reason) at, and subsequent to, the last State 
 Fair, of the want of more committees in some of the depart- 
 ments of the Exhibition; many articles were, of necessity 
 either entirely overlooked, or given such hasty notice as mt 
 to satisfy the exhibitors. Premiums wero sometimes awarde I 
 to articles not entitled to the distinction assigned them, and 
 others of deserved merit failed to receive that consideration 
 to which they were entitled. And many of the committees 
 were taxed to their utmost exertions, from morning until night 
 in their efforts to discharge the onerous duties allotted them.
