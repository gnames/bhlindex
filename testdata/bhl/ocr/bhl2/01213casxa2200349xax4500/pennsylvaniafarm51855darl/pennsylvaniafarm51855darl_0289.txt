To prevent a recurrence of theso evils, and to do justice 
 to exhibitors as well as judges, the Executive Committee at 
 its last meeting, ordered that the committees in the princi- 
 pal departments of the Exhibition, and particularly that of 
 Farm Implements and Machinery, be subdivided. But I 
 observe that the Committees and Divisions, as published in 
 your last number are, (with one unimportant exception) 
 precisely the same as last year. Can the President under 
 whose supervision the arrangement of Committees is made 
 tell why the directions of the Executive Committee were 
 not carried out?

 Deep Tillage. 

Much as has been said upon this important subject, its 
 merits are not generally fully appreciated. 

Although it is admitted that there is strength in proportion 
 to volume of every thing else, yet when it comes to soil on 
 the product of which we subsist, it is not understood. Many 
 years ago I heard old experienced farmers, say that a mixture 
 of soils was beneficial, and in order to get it they would some- 
 times haul it from the road side, or even dig it out of the in- 
 side corners of the fence in the same field that they needed it. 
 These facts and others given by various persons upon the 
 subject induced me to think that I could obtain that mixture 
 by deeper plowing, and thereby save the extra hauling. I 
 tried it and I find that I have turned up a strata of virgin soil 
 that has never been exhausted, which pays well for all the 
 extra labor. 

The quality is thereby improved, the volume is increased, 
 the facility with which moisture in a dry time is conveyed to 
 the plant through capilliary attraction in the porosity of the 
 pulverized soil is extended, also the super abundant water in 
 a wet is convoyed off more readily Ac. 

Hence with others before me, I say plow deep, and in or- 
 der to do this more readily, keep your plow irons in good re- 
 pair. I thank no hired man for running my irons close (as it 
 is called) if he does intend to favor me by it. In the fall 
 plowing, many are in the habit of plowing shallow the first 
 time but this is a mistake, go deep every time, and the oftencr 
 the deeper if you can ; also fine, so that every particle of soil 
 that you pass over is moved, loosened and pulverised finely 
 so that the root may obtain its proper nourishment more 
 readily then no farmer or farmer's son need go to California 
 for gold. 

I am not accustomed to write for the press, friend Dar- 
 lington, but if you think the publicity of this item will be of 
 any account you are at liberty to give it through the Jour- 
 nal. Yours truly, JESSE E. PHILIPS.

Hen Manure — Grafting on Walnut. 
 Mr. Darlington: — Sir: — In the May No. of the "Jour- 
 nal," I notice a communication written by Rev. Richard 
 Bedford, of Sullivan County, which, in part, is intended as 
 a reply to my communication upon the value of "Hen Ma- 
 nure" as a top dressing, and as he has certainly not compre- 
 hended my views fully, I desire merely to right him upon 
 one or two points. In the first place it was not my object 
 that the reader should infer that I considered hen manure 
 valuable only as a top dressing. I think I know too well the 
 importance of retaining all the ammonia, which it may con- 
 tain, to attempt the establishment of any such theory, but 
 my intention was simply to reoall to mind its importance as 
 such where large quantities could not be had, and then it 
 might be used with the most immediate advantage. In the 
 second place, my suggestion as to the propriety of placing 

the manure upon the hills, or on the beds, in order that it 
 might be decomposed and thereby lose much of its ammo- 
 nia, was made with the view that it might be used with the 
 greater safety by those who have never tested its fertilizing 
 properties. I have the satisfaction of knowing, from expe- 
 rience, that if applied to garden vegetables generally after 
 they are up many of them will require replanting. The first 
 season I used it I applied to the plant and immediately cov- 
 ered it with earth and I completely destroyed my early to- 
 mato and cabbage plants, since which time I have been a 
 little more careful in its nse, and as I cannot get sufficient 
 quantity to spade into my garden I continue to use it as a 
 top dressing with the most beneficial results; first allowing 
 it to remain on the soil until a portion of its ammonia has 
 escaped and then mixing it with the soil in and about the 
 plant. With all vegetables that require transplanting I 
 maintain that the position is a sound one — with those that 
 do not require transplanting its admixture with the soil is 
 decidedly preferable for the reasons stated by my friend 
 from Sullivan. 

While addressing you, Mr. Editor, will you do me the 
 favor to state, or any one of your numerous correspondents, 
 whether it is practicable to graft Peach on Walnut. A lady 
 friend of mine spent a few months in Ohio, some years ago. 
 and she was very particular to inform me on her return that 
 "grafting peach on walnut was very common" there. I 
 have never tried it for the reason that I have had no walnut 
 on my lot. If you can throw any light upon the subject 
 you will much oblige, Yours truly W. P. J. PAINTER. 

Muncy, Pa,, July, 1855. 

In reference to grafting the Peach on the Walnut, there 
 is doubtless some mistake about its ever having been done 
 in Ohio, or any where else. They belong to different natu- 
 ral families, so entirely dissimilar, that no union could prob- 
 ably be effected at all, or if any, one that would last but a 
 very short time. — Ed. 

Performance of the Steam Plow in England. 
 As we were coming away from the trial field, impressed 
 with the sentiment that "the steam cultivators were a fail- 
 ure," and soaked with rain, old Aquarius having turned on 
 his taps, as if to give old Walter Scot the lie for saying the 
 "sun shines bright on Carlisle wall,"the stewards, Mr. Amos. 
 and somo few other lucky individuals, received intelligence 
 that another steam plow had started in a field half a mile off. 
 Making the best of our way to the light land trial field, there 
 sure enough, stood a portable engine in one corner, with ropes 
 and pulleys, and a plowing machine all in action. The en- 
 gine was that belonging to Mr. Lee, of Wisall, and the plow 
 and tackle are the invention of Messrs. Fisker, of Stamfords- 
 ham manufactured by R. Roger, of Stockton-on-Tees. It 
 had been tried at Perthshire, last winter, being actuated by 
 a water-wheel : this being the first day of its trial with steam 
 power. The whole apparatus is novel, and we may say, un- 
 commonly promising. Instead of a heavy wire rope to drag 
 the plow frame by main force, a light endless hemp rope, 
 only three-eights of an inch thick, communicates power to 
 the plow carriage, which we may call locomotive, as it propels 
 itself in the following manner: — a grooved wheel set in mo- 
 tion by proper spur wheels from the rigger actuated by the 
 hemp rope, winds, as it were, along a strong wire rope laid 
 upon the ground; and the frame being thus carried slowly 
 forward, drags plows or other implements after it. The 
 hemp cord does not touch the ground, but is held up at ev- 
 ery 40 yards distance by a "horse," or small friction pulley 
 frame, about 3£ feet high. This cord travels at the rate of 
 20 miles per hour; but the speed being reduced by the wheel 
 work upon the plow carriage, the latter travels only 2 miles
