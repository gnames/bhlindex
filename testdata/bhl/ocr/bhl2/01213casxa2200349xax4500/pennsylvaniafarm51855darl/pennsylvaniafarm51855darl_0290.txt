per hour. When two plows are in work at once having the 
 draught of four horses, the strain upon the rapidly running 
 ord will thus be less than half a horse's draught. We 
 were informed by the exhibitor that a 4-horse engine is suf- 
 ficiently powerful to work two plows, and that with 4 cwt of 
 c'oal it will plow 4 acres in a day, tho expense for labor being 
 ouly that of two men and a boy. If this be strictly the fact, 
 we have a complete invention able to plow light land at a 
 cost of say 3s. per acre. That it is not far from the truth 
 we are sure, for we ourselves saw one plow drawn at the 
 rate of at least two miles per hour when the engine had 
 only 7 lbs. or 8 lbs. pressure upon the square inch, and this 
 was an engine of 6-horse power at 40 lbs. pressure. To be 
 sure, the land had been previously plowed, pulverized sub- 
 jected to the trial of all sorts of drills, and been afterwards 
 well trampled by hundreds of people, and consolidated with 
 rain, so that the possible quantity and quality of the work 
 could not well be ascertained. The plowing we saw was re- 
 spectably though roughly done, but there was one point 
 really performed — the furrows were well turned. If a steam 
 cultivator can invert the soil thoroughly and cheaply we may 
 put up with a little imperfection in the straightness of cut- 
 ting and eveness of laying. Tho method of anchoring the 
 pulleys, and the arrangement of tho pulleys and ropes, is 
 very ingenious, and can hardly be explained with brevity. 
 The anchorage consists of a plate or plow, a few feet in 
 length, and 8 inches only in depth; this can be easily drawn 
 forward in the ground without the trouble of digging holes, 
 taking up, setting down again <tc, and yet it presents a 
 sufficient resistance sideways to the pull of the ropes. A 
 wheel, pinion and crank, on each anchor is used to draw it 
 by means of a rope towards a fixed post, when it is required 
 to be shifted. The arrangement of the ropes about the an- 
 chored pulleys is like that of the chains in a travelling crane 
 the anchorage being shifted forwards at intervals without 
 altering the length of the rope. The plows are not rigidly 
 attached to the travelling frame, but are hung by short iron 
 beams, which form levers, having a slight degree of play 
 up and down. There are four plows — two before and two 
 behind the carriage pointing opposite ways, a neat lever 
 movement lifting two out of work and dropping the other 
 pair of plows in ; so that the machine can plow both ways 
 without having to turn round at the land's end. — London

The New Blackberry. 

A year since we gave a somewhat full report (the first one 
 published, we believe,) upon the claims, characteristics and 
 value of the New-Rochelle Blackberry — called also tho Law- 
 ton. We recommended tho plant as one worthy of cultiva- 
 tion, and our endorsement and remarks have been exten- 
 sively copied by the press of this country, and by some Eu- 
 ropean journals, and a very general interest has been awa- 
 kened. An evidence of this is found in the circumstance 
 that, during this month, more than a hundred horticulturists 
 and others, from Boston, New-York, Philadelphia, and the 
 cities and towns betwoen these places, as well as from Con- 
 cord, Albany, Newburg, Utica, Syracuse, and Rochester, 
 have visited the grounds of Messrs. Geo. Seymour & Co., 
 of South Norwalk, Conn., in response to their invitation for 
 "all interested to come and seo the plant growing and bear- 
 ing, and taste the quality of the fruit." 

These gentlemen have, we believe, the largest area in the 
 country (some five or six acres) devoted to the cultivation 
 of the genuine variety of this plant. A part of this ground 
 they use for raising young plants, and a part was left to fruit 
 this year for the purpose of showing it in bearing while in 
 field culture. All who have examined the fruit have been 

surprised and delighted with the large size of the berry, ita 
 deliciousness, and especially its productiveness. We visited 
 this plot on Thursday of last week, and from what we saw 
 there, as well as at other times during the past year, we are 
 ready to endorso all we stated a year ago. 

The plants especially devoted to fruiting were set out two 
 years ago — eight feet apart each way — upon a rather poor, 
 worn-out, hill-side soil, with no other previous preparation 
 than plowing and an ordinary coat of barn-yard manure. 
 The only cultivation since has been keeping down the weeds, 
 and the application of about 400 lbs. per acre of Peruvian 
 guano, which was sown broadcast last spring and worked in 
 with a cultivator where the plants were not spread out so 
 much as to preclude the use of this kn piemen t. The ground 
 is now so thickly covered with loadod vines and young 
 shoots that it is difficult to go over it. 

Since the beginning of the month visitors have had free 
 access to about one-fourth of an acre, and though hundreds 
 of quarts have been eaten or carried away, the whole vines 
 on this plot seemed to be loaded with berries. Two canes 
 in each hill were allowed to fruit. We counted the berries 
 on some of the average-bearing canes or single stalks, and 
 and found from 500 to 1,000 ripe or growing berries on each. 

The size of the fruit can hardly be appreciated by those 
 who have seen only the common varieties of blackberry. 
 Of about the average size, 30 to 40 berries filled a pint bas- 
 ket; while of those a little above the medium, 20 to 25 ber- 
 ries did the same. An inch to an inch and a half may be 
 set down as the average diameter, though larger berries are 
 quite common. 

There are two remarkable things about this variety, viz : 
 its few seeds and its richness of flavor, notwithstanding its 
 large size, and steady bearing ; for we learn that it has not 
 failed to yield an abundance of fruit every year since its 
 cultivation, now a dozen years or more. 

It appears quite hardy, as it sustained very little injury 
 in the open field during the past severe winter. We noticed 
 tho tops of a few of last year's canes were slightly nipped 
 by frost. 

It grows well even upon poor soil. We should advise a 
 moderately dry loam, but some cultivators recommend even 
 a heavy clay as best. It has been thought that blackberries 
 need shade; but those cultivated by Seymour & Co. are 
 upon an open lot, and ve found the best and richest berries 
 upon the top of the vines, where most exposed to the sun. 
 However, the fullest clusters of the largest fruit, though not 
 the sweetest, were partly shaded by the leaves. Mulching, 
 or covering the soil with straw, leaves, salt hay, or some 
 such substance, is doubtless good treatment for this, as for 
 all similar plants. We should advise the selection of at least 
 a moderately good soil, deep plowing or spading, with a 
 coating of barn-yard manure or guano. When first set out 
 they should be placed at about their natural depth, say throe 
 inches, in rows 6 to 10 feet apart, and the stems be cut down 
 to within six inches of tho ground. 

They may be set out in November or April, in this lati- 
 tude ; at the South, in March. Probably November planting 
 is preferable. If planted in autumn, it is better to cover 
 them up till spring with straw or litter. 

We have spoken thus freely of this fruit, because we es- 
 teem it a valuable acquisition, and we desire to see it dis- 
 tributed so extensively that it may soon become abundant in 
 every market. It now sells readily in New York for 25 to 
 50 cents per quart, while we do not see why it may not be 
 raised, with a fair profit, at 5 or 6 cents a quart. Once 
 planted, it requires no more labor to cultivate it than tho 
 same area of corn, since the chief care required is to keep 
 down the weeds and an excessive growth of young shoots ;
