though all of these that can bo raised for some time to come 
 will probably be in demand at fair prices. The limited sup- 
 ply, and the high prices heretofore asked, has been a bar to 
 its general introduction; but several persons have a large 
 number of growing vines which will be ready for sale the 
 coming autumn, and we learn that the price is being consid- 
 erably reduced. 

A word of caution is necessary in reference to securing 
 genuine plants, carefully packed; for unprincipled and irre- 
 sponsible peddlers and speculators will in this case, as in 
 that of fruit trees, attempt to palm off any thing in the 
 shape of a blackberry vine, as the genuine New-Rochello. 
 If carefully packed, they may be carried safely to a consid- 
 erable distance, provided always, that in taking up or set- 
 ting out, the roots are never left exposed to wind and sun.—

The Time When Pears Should he Gathered. 

BY M. DE JONGHE, OF BRUSSELS. 

Formerly when the varieties of Pears in cultivation were 
 comparatively few, there was little difficulty in knowing the 
 time when each sort ought to be gathered; but now, when the 
 number of good varieties is so much increased, the proper 
 time for gathering the respective sorts cannot be known 
 without a certain experience acquired during a period of 
 from three to five years in order that a mean may be obtain- 
 ed. For the maturity of the fruit on the tree depends : — 

1. On the individual constitution of the tree, and its liabil- 
 ity to change. 

2. On the soil in which the tree is planted. 

3. On the influence of the stock. 

4. On the temperature of the season, whether more or less 
 favorable for accelerating the maturity of the fruit. 

In order to know exactly the mean period of maturity on 
 the tree of auy particular variety of fruit, it is necessary to 
 observe several trees of such variety, planted in different soils 
 and situations. With regard to the varieties of Pears which 
 ripen at the end of summer, or early in autumn, it is not 
 difficult to fix the date when they should be gathered; for 
 in the same situation, this, in different years, does not vary- 
 more than 10 days. 

The influence of soil, of stocks and of temperature more 
 or less warm and dry, is not so great on early fruits as on 
 the late autumn, winter, and spring varieties. With regard 
 to the summer and early autumn kinds, they cannot always 
 be left to ripen completely on the tree, grown as a pyramid 
 or standard, and it is needless to add that these sorts of fruit 
 do not, in our climate, merit a wall, where in fact they are 
 never so good as in open ground. When a considerable 
 number of fruits is observed to have reached the point of 
 maturity, and when, with a slight pressure of the thumb, the 
 Stalk is readily detached, without twisting at its junction 
 with the spur, a portion of the fruit should then be gathered, 
 and allowed to acquire their full maturity in the fruit-room. 
 This first gathering will ease the tree, and the whole of the 
 nutritivo sap will be directed towards the remaining fruits, 
 which, in consequence become much finer; these are gathered 
 in the same manner, and successionally. The operation of 
 successional gathering, called, in French gardening terms, 
 Ventreciieillemcnt, may be very advantageously followed up, 
 because all the fruits on a tree never ripen simultaneously ; 
 and that they may acquire full perfection, it is important that 
 they should be left on the tree to attain the necessary degree 
 of maturity known to the practised eye by certain signs 
 which it would be difficult to point out without entering into 
 tedious details. 

With regard to tho late autumn, winter and spring Pears, 
 the same proceeding is adopted; it is only by successional 

gathering, Ventrecueillcment, that we can hit upon the proper 
 time and know the happy medium between gathering too 
 early or too late. The gathering of these fruits in season 
 as above mentioned, commences about the middle of Septem- 
 ber, and continues till the end of October, or till just before 
 the fall of the leaves. 

When some fruits, neither bruised nor pierced by inseets 
 of a lato variety of Pear begin to drop, although not affected 
 by strong winds nor by the continued drought which we 
 sometimes experience in our climate towards the end of Sep- 
 tember ; and when the leaves begin to turn yellow and fall 
 from the tree, an attentive and experienced person will per- 
 ceive that the period of gathering is close at hand. 

As above stated, the period of the maturity of the fruit on 
 the tree, and likewise in the fruit-room, depends in a great 
 measure on the soil in which the tree is planted ; and the 
 most delicious qualities of certain varieties of Pears are owing 
 to the peculiar nature of the soil. The lighter, warmer and 
 drier the soil, the sooner the flow of sap ends, and the earlier 
 the fruit indicates the necessity of partial gathering. But 
 in case of a stiff cold soil it is the reverse. The first variety 
 of soil will be favorable to one kind of Pear, whilst the sec- 
 ond would be unfavorable, and vice versa. But these details 
 belong to a monograph on the cultivation of the principal kinds 
 of Pears; which it is hoped will be completed some of these 
 days, and it will prove very useful to young and inexperien- 
 ced cultivators. In proof of this, I may be permitted to give 
 an example and it is taken from amongst many others. The 
 variety of Pear called the Nouveau Poiteau of Van Mons, is 
 unquestionably one of great vigor, very hardy, and produc- 
 tive. Worked on the pear stock, and trained en.pyrqmid, it 
 bears fruit as largo and as handsome as the Duchess d'Angou- 
 leme, Beurre Clairgeau, and Maria Louise. Cultivated on 
 the Pear stock, or on the Quince, in a free light soil, with a 
 more substantial and somewhat gravelly subsoil, this variety 
 bears fruit which is melting, sugary, vinous and slightly aro- 
 matic; whereas, if the tree is cultivated in a stiff cold soil, the 
 fruit possesses none of these qualities. It is to be observed 
 that the mean period of the maturity of the fruit takes place 
 between the 10th and 25th of November, but without any 
 change in its color, (an opaque green), to announce that such 
 is the case. 

It cannot be denied, and all practical men agree, that the 
 stock has great influence, not only as regards the period of 
 gathering the fruit, but also with respect to that of its ripen- 
 ing in the fruit-room. I knew a cultivator who raised stock? 
 for budding with summer and autumn fruits, others for winter 
 and spring varieties. With regard to the summer and au- 
 tumn kinds the nature of the stock is of little importance ; but 
 when long keeping sorts are worked on wild Pear stocks, 
 which stocks if allowed to fruit would produce summer 
 Pears, it is certain that the period of ripening of late Pears 
 worked on these stocks would be affected. I have seen some 
 seedlings, planted in proper soil, produce fruit of which the 
 medium time of ripening on their own roots had been fixed 
 between December and February; but when grafted on 
 summer or early ripening wild Pears, the ripening of the 
 above varieties, grown on similar soil, was accelerated more 
 than a month. Such irregularities do not result from propa- 
 gations on the Quince stocks, because these are identically 
 reproduced from layers. The importance of avoiding the 
 unsuitable union of wintor and summer fruits will be readily 
 admitted; that is, the grafting of late ripening varieties of 
 Pear trees on early ripening wild Pear stocks. 

I am aware it will be objected that the purchaser would 
 not take precautions on this point into consideration; that 
 he only sees to the young trees having been once or twice 
 properly cut or pruned and that a certain number of such
