millstone grit are often thus burned up in summer, and were 
 it possible so as to deepen such land, it would be seen that 
 a couple of farms would be more productive if they could be 
 laid one a-top of the other than they now are in their extent 
 and shallowness. — Gardeners' h Chronicle. 

Farm-Yard Poultry. 
 From time to time the columns of the "Poultry Chronicle" 
 have urged the necessity of increased care and attention to 
 farm-yard stock. It must be apparent to any person conver- 
 sant with the amount of poultry and eggs annually required 
 in the United Kingdom, and the large quantity of breeding 
 poultry kept on farms, that the produce is not equal to the 
 demand, nor does it reach the amount it ought to do ; this 
 arises chiefly from farmers keeping bad small stock, breeding 
 in, and retaining old and useless birds. It is difficult indeed 
 impossible, to obtain any correct amount of the enormous 
 importation of poultry and eggs from abroad. A recent ar- 
 ticle in the "Quarterly Review" gives some useful informa- 
 tion on this point, but the Writer confines his observations to 
 London alone. There can be no doubi that the trade is a 
 most valuable one, and it is much to be regretted that our 
 own farmers, (who by keeping poultry admit the necessity 
 of such stock on a farm) should throw away so great a source 
 of profit. The following figures will show that the trade is 
 very considerable, they refer only to the quantities brought 
 into two of the principal London markets, and are as follows: 

Eggs 75,000,000 

Fowls 2,000,000 

Pigeons 400,000 

Turkeys 100,000 

Geese 100,000 

Ducks 300,000 

In addition to these quantities, the vast amount sent to 
 poulterers and private houses must be considered. It is 
 difficult to say what proportion of this comes from abroad, 
 but the fact that sixty million of eggs are imported annually 
 from France, and that the Brighton Railway alone carries 
 yearly about 2,600 tuns of eggs brought from Belgium and 
 France, are fair indications as to the rest. 

If this very large trade is so valuable to foreigners, it must 
 be apparent to any poultry keeper that the British producers 
 should take steps to secure it for themselves. 

It is notorious that this year there has been a great want 
 of poultry, not only in London, but in poulterer's shops 
 throughout the kingdom, and it is equally well known that, 
 except in London or some of the largest towns, a good plump 
 well fed fowl is never found. This is the result of the pres- 
 ent farm-yard system, if such carelessness can be called a 
 system. The little fowls produce little chickens, and after 
 having given as much trouble and eaten as much food as a. 
 good bird would have, they are sent to the local market, and 
 bring such small prices as to be quite unremunerative. 
 Had these birds been the produce of really good stock, and 
 received a little extra care to make them plump, they would 
 without increase of trouble or expense, have realized such a 
 sum as would have perceptibly increased the year's receipts. 
 These observations are not made to those who are prejudiced 
 against, and do not keep fowls, but to those who at present 
 keep bad ones with a view to encouraging them to get good 
 ones. Nothing is more easy, thanks to the numerous exhi- 
 bitions ; there is scarcely a neighborhood that has not one or 
 more breeders of good stock, generally willing to part with 
 some of their surplus birds at moderate prices. 

It can scarcely be doubted that the best stock for table 
 purposes-is the Dorking; the varieties have been mentioned 
 before in these pages. Those who wish to breed a very large 
 bird should procure the light grey or speckled kinds; those 
 who wish to have a moderate plnmp bird may get the Silver 

Grey variety, sometimes known as "Lord Hill's breed." 
 These birds are to their larger brethern what the Southdown 
 sheep is to the Leicester, and other larger varieties, and they 
 have one advantage to the fancier, viz., that they breed true 
 to color, which the larger birds do not, and there are few 
 things more agreeable in poultry keeping than a yard filled 
 with evenly-marked birds, all alike ; but whatever breeding 
 stock may be decided upon, no poultry keeper who wants 
 eggs should be without Cochin or Brahma pullets : as winter 
 layers they are invaluable, and produce a constant supply 
 when fresh eggs command a high price. If Ducks are kept, 
 the Rouen or Aylesbury will answer best; and if Turkeys are 
 required, the Norfolk or Cambridge birds will make as fine 
 meat as need be wished. — Am. Agriculturist. 

Profits of Fruit 

Examples almost without number may be given, where 
 single trees have yielded from five to ten dollars a year in 
 fruit, and many instances in which twenty or thirty dollars 
 have been obtained. If one tree of the Rhode Island Green- 
 ing will afford forty bushels of fruity at a quarter of a dollar 
 per bushel, which has often occurred, forty such trees on an 
 acre would yield a crop worth four hundred dollars. But 
 taking one quarter of this amount as a low average for all 
 seasons, and with imperfect cultivation, one hundred dollars 
 will still be equal to the interest on fifteen hundred per acre. 
 Now, this estimate is based upon the price of good winter ap- 
 ples for the past thirty years, in one of our most productive 
 districts; let a similar estimate be made with fruits rarer 
 and of a more delicate character. Apricots, and the finer 
 varieties of the plum, are often sold for three to six dollars 
 per bushel; the best early peaches from one to three dollars; 
 and pears from hardy and productive trees, two to five bush- 
 els per tree, with good management, is a frequent crop ; and 
 on large pear trees fivo times the quantity. An acquaintance 
 received eight dollars for a crop grown on two fine young 
 cherry trees, and twenty-four dollars from four young peach 
 trees of only six years' growth from the bud. In Western 
 New-York, single trees of the Doyenne or Virgnlieu pear have 
 often afforded a return of twenty dollars or more, after being 
 sent hundreds of miles to market. An acre of such trees, 
 well managed, would far exceed in profit a five hundred acre 
 farm. 

But the anxious inquiry is suggested, "Will not our mar- 
 kets be surfeited with fruit? This will depend on the judge- 
 ment and discretion of cultivators. With the exception of 
 the peaches of Philadelphia and the strawberries of Cincin- 
 nati, a great deficiency is felt in all our large cities. Of 
 these two fruits, largo plantations are brought rapidly into 
 bearing. The fruit, when ripe, quickly perishes, and cannot 
 be kept a week ; yet thousands of acres in peach trees, bend- 
 ing under their heavy crops, are needed for the consumption 
 of the one city, and broad, fifty acre fields, redden with 
 enormous products, send many hundred bushels of strawber- 
 ries daily into the other. If, instead of keeping but three 
 days, sorts were now added three months, many times the 
 amount would be needed. But the market would not be con- 
 fined to large cities. Railroads and steamboats would open 
 new channels of distribution throughout the country for in- 
 creased supplies. Nor would the business stop here. Largo 
 portions of the Eastern Continent would gladly become pur- 
 chasers as soon as sufficient quantities should create facilities 
 fora. reasonable supply. Our best apples are eagerly bought 
 in London and Liverpool, where nine dollars per barrel is not 
 an unusual price for the best Newton Pippins. And by 
 being packed in ice, Doyenne pears gathered early in autumn 
 have been safely sent to Jamaica, and strawberries for Bar- 
 badoes. The Baldwin apple has been furnished in good
