Fruit Growing in Philadelphia.— Large Plums. 
 One of our neighbors was recently showing us a spe- 
 cimen of his fruit orchard in Philadelphia, only a few feet 
 square, attached to his dwelling, which illustrates how 
 much can be done in a small space. They were Coe's 
 Golden Drop Plums of extraordinary size and beauty, 
 one of them weighing two and a half ounces — a luxury 
 even to loot on, to say nothing of the eating qualities, 
 which of this variety are well known to be unsurpassed. 
 We have often observed the superior quality of fruit 

grown in our city gardens, particularly pears and plums. 
 The comparative freedom of the latter in the city from 
 the curculio, is no doubt partly owing to the pavements 
 admitting no harbor for their eggs, which are destroyed 
 with the punctured plums when dropped. We knoAY of 
 a case where air-slaked lime was applied once a week, 
 early in the morning, by dusting it over three plum trees. 
 Adjoining were three other plum trees, equally loaded 
 with fruit, to which the lime was not applied. In the 
 latter, the plums were stung and all dropped off; in the 
 other case they ripened and perfected all their fruit. 
 What has become of Matthews' remedy for the curculio? 
 Are not the committee prepared to report ?

NORTH DEVON COW "BIRTHDAY" (38)*, ten years old. 

Winner of the first prize at the New York State Show 
 in 1853 and 1854. First prize at the Devon Agricultural 
 Show at Exeter in 1848, and first prize at the Barnstaple 
 and North Devon Cattle Show in 1848, as one of a dairy 
 of cows. She was sired by Proctor (109), dam Taunton 
 (410), and is the property of L. G. Morris, by whom she 
 was selected and imported. 

The above is a perfect model of a true North Devon 
 cow, having nearly every good point for which the breed 
 is so celebrated. Her form is a capital subject for study 
 to young farmers, who are about introducing Devon 
 stock on their farms. In our third volume, page 34, 
 will be found a scale of points for Devons adopted by 
 the New York State Agricultural Society. By compa- 
 ring the engraving before us with this scale, Birthday 
 will be found to have nearly all the points constituting 
 excellence. Whatever preferences persons may have for 
 particular breeds, all admit that for oxen the Devons are 
 altogether unrivalled. Their shoulder approaches in form 
 that of the horse, having that obliquity which enables them 
 to lift freely their fore extremities, while their quarters 
 behind are relatively long — a character connected in the 
 ox as in the horse with the power of active motion.

Their bodies too are light, and their limbs long, muscu- 
 lar to the hock and knee, and below these points sinewy. 
 Low says, "in England they trot well in harness, and 
 will keep pace with a horse in the ordinary labors of the 
 farm." We hope to see many of the fine Devons in 
 Pennsylvania at the approaching exhibition at Harris- 
 burg. 

We know of several Devon cows, very superior milk- 
 ers, and perhaps the best stock in the country of mixed 
 blood, for dairy purposes, is part Devon. 

Transplanting Evergreens. 
 From the middle of August to the middle of Septem- 
 ber is preferred by some to any other season for trans- 
 planting evergreens. Others prefer late spring planting, 
 say from the middle and last of April to the middle and 
 last of May. There is no doubt, as a general thing, 
 there are more failures in moving evergreens than de- 
 ciduous trees, but we say unhesitatingly there is no rea- 
 son for this. We should rather consider the risk to be 
 in their favor, provided the proper precautions are ob- 
 served. Most varieties of evergreens abound more in 
 fibrous roots, which cling close to the soil, and are taken
