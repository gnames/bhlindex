not suffer so much from drought, and have more strength 
 to withstand the drawbacks of sudden changes of tem- 
 perature, often fatal to young trees; fourth, a better 
 assortment can "generally be obtained at the nurseries, 
 than in the spring. In fall planting it i3 highly impor- 
 tant that the trees should be well staked, to prevent be- 
 ing blown about by high winds ; a few stones placed 
 around the tree will also assist in keeping it steady. A 
 map of every newly planted orchard should be made, 
 with the position, and name of each tree. Every variety 
 should also be denoted by a zinc label as described in 
 one of our back Nos., and attached to the tree by a cop- 
 per wire. In respect to exposure and location, it should 
 be remembered that on high situations, and with north- 
 ern slopes there is less danger of injury from late spring 
 frosts. Trees should not be planted in sod, but mellow 
 ground, previously deeply ploughed and subsoiled, and as 

an orchard can not be thoroughly ploughed after trees 
 are planted, it is important that this should be well done 
 previously. Nothing but the Double Michigan Plow 
 would answer our purpose if we had an orchard to plant, 
 and no depth less than at least ten inches. The yellow 
 sub-soil, rich in inorganic materials, which has never 
 been disturbed, should be brought up to the light of day 
 and the fertilizing influences of the atmosphere. The 
 roots of the trees can then extend themselves in search 
 of moisture, or food, and the thrift and vigor of the 
 orchard will be greatly promoted. 

For list of varieties, we refer to the lists of the Amer- 
 ican Pomological Society, published in our former num- 
 bers.
