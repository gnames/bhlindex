STYER PEAR. 

Tlie following account of t!ie above fine American 
 Seedling Pear, -was furnished to the Horticulturist by 
 Alan W. Corson, of Montgomery county, Penn. 

About sixteen years ago, Mr. Charles Stter, of 
 White Plain township, Montgomery county, residing 
 some fifteen miles from Philadelphia, engaged a man to 
 make a fence for him. Mr. Stter happened, at the 
 time, to say something about having some pear stocks 
 grafted; on hearing which, the fence-maker said he 
 knew where there was a fine kind, and would bring him 
 some of the scions. He accordingly fulfilled his promise, 
 and the scions were inserted; but it was never known 
 where he obtained them, and he died without imparting 
 the information. From these grafted trees, however, 
 the variety has been propagated to some extent in that 
 neighborhood. 

The Slyer is represented to be an abundant bearer of 
 fair and perfect fruit, commanding a high price. 

Fruit — medium size, about two and a half inches long 
 by two and three-quarters wide. Form — roundish. Skin 
 — green, becoming yellow, with many russet dots and 
 markings. Stalk — three-fourths of an inch long, vary- 
 ing in thickness from one-sixteenth to one-eighth of an 
 inch, and inserted in a small shallow cavity. Calyx — 
 almost obsolete. Basin — narrow, moderately deep. Core 
 — medium. Seed — blackish or very dark brown, short, 
 rather plump, with a slight prominence or angle on one 
 side of the broad extremity. Flesh — yellowish white, 
 somewhat gritty at the core, buttery, melting. Flavor — 
 exceedingly rich and perfumed. Period of maturity 
 about the first of September. 

List of Judges at the State Fair. 
 The disappointments hitherto experienced from non-at- 
 tondance of Members of Committees originally appointed to 
 award the premiums, have led to increasing, as in the present 
 instance, the Judges to five, instead of three as formerly, with 
 the view of securing at least a working majority of those ap- 
 pointed. 

If any of the individuals on the following list should find 
 that they cannot attend to the duties of the appointment, 
 they will please notify me, to that effect, as early as possible. 

^®-The Judges are requested to meet at the President's 
 Tent at four o'clock P. M., on Tuesday, the first day of the 
 Exhibition, to organize; when they will be furnished with 
 the Premium List, also with a blank book to facilitate their 
 d "ties. JAMES GOWEN.
