[September 

agricultural warehouse you may be disappointed. The way 
 to do is, to seleet the best specimens from your own raising; 
 then you are sure they are fresh, at least. Mrs. Sparrow- 
 grass opened tho box. First she took out a package of seeds, 
 wrapped up in a newspaper — then she took out another 
 package tied up in brown paper — then she drew forth a 
 bundle that was pinned up — then another that was taped up 
 — then another twisted up — then out came a bursted package 
 of watermelon seeds — then a withered oar of corn — then 
 another package of watermelon seeds from another melon — 
 then a handful of split okra pods — then handsful of beans, 
 peas, squash seeds, melon seeds, cucumber seeds, sweet corn 
 evergreen corn, and other germs. Then another bursted 
 paper of watermelon seeds. There were watermelon seeds 
 enough to keep half the country supplied with this refresh- 
 ing article of luxury. As the treasures were spread out on 
 the table, there came over me a feeling that reminded me of 
 Christmas times, when the young ones used to pant down 
 stairs, before dawn, lamp in hand, to see the kindly toy-gifts 
 of Santo Claus. Thon the Mental Gardener, taking Antici- 
 pation by the hand, went forth into the futuro garden; the 
 peas sprouted out in round leaves, tomato put forth his aro- 
 matic spread; sweet corn thrust his green blades out of 
 many a hillock; lettuce threw up his slender spoons; beans 
 shouldered their way into the world, like iEneases, with the 
 old beans on their backs ; and watermelon and cucumber, 
 in voluptuous play, sported over the beds like truant school 
 boys. 

"Here are sweet peas, on tiptoe for a flight; 
 ~\Yith wings of gentle flush -o'er delicate white, 
 And taper Angers catching at, all things, 
 To bind them all about with tiny rings." 

"Now," said I, "Mrs. Sparrowgrass, let us arrange these 
 in proper order; I will make a chart of the gardon on a 
 piece of paper, and put everything down with a date, to be 
 planted with its proper time." Mrs. Sparrowgrass said she 
 thought that an excellent plan. "Yes," I replied, tasting 
 the cider, "we will make a garden to night on paper, a 
 ground plan, as it were, and plant from that; now, Mrs. S. 
 read off the different packages." Mrs. Sparrowgrass took 
 up a paper and laid it aside, then another, and laid it aside. 
 "I think," said she, as the third paper was placed upon the 
 table, "I did not write any names on the seeds, but I have 
 not the least doubt I can easily tell them apart; these," said 
 she, "are watermelons." "Very well, what next?" "The 
 next," said Mrs. S., "is either musk-melon or cucumber 
 seed." "My dear," said I, "we want plenty of melons, for 
 the summer, but I do not wish to plant half an acre of pick- 
 les by mistake; can't you be sure about the matter?" Mrs. 
 S. said she could not. "Well, then, lay the paper down and 
 call off the next." "The next are not radishes, I know," 
 said Mrs. S. ; they must be summer cabbages." "Are you 
 sure now, Mrs. Sparrowgrass," said I, getting a little out of 
 temper. Mrs. S. said she was sure of it, because cabbage 
 seed looked exactly like turnip seed. "Did you save turnip 
 seed also," said I. Mrs. Sparrowgrass replied, that she had 
 provided some, but they must be in another paper. "Then 
 call off the next; we will plant them for cabbages, whether 
 or no." Here is a name," said Mrs. S., brightening up. 
 "Read it," said I, pen in hand. "Watermelons — not so 
 good,' said Mrs. S. Lay that paper with the rest and pro- 
 ceed." "Corn," said Mrs. S. with a smile. "Variety?" 
 "Pop, I am sure." "Good, now we begin to see daylight." 
 "Squash." said Mrs. Sparrowgrass. "Winter or Summer?" 
 "Both." Lay that paper aside, my dear." "Tomato." "Red 
 or yellow?" Mrs. Sparrowgrass said she had pinnod up the 
 one and tied up the other, to distinguish them, but it was so 
 long ago, she had forgotten which was which. "Never 
 mind," said I, "there is one comfort, they cannot bear with- 

out showing their colors." "Now for the next." Mrs. S. 
 said upon tasting tho tomato seed, she was sure they wore 
 bell-peppers. "Very well, so much is gained,, we are sure 
 of the capsicum. "The next" "Beans," said Mrs. S. 

There is one kind of bean, in regard to which I have a 
 prejudice. I allude to the asparagus bean, a sort of long- 
 winded esculent, inclined to be proline in strings. It does 
 not climb very high on the pole, but crops out in an abun- 
 dance of pods, usually not shorter than a bill of extras, after 
 a contract; and although interesting as a curious vegetable, 
 still not exactly the bean likely to be highly eommended by 
 your city guests, when served up to them at table. When 
 Mrs. S., in answer to my question, as to the particular spe- 
 cies of bean referred too, answered, "Limas," I felt relief 
 at once. "Put the LiuiaSto the right with the sheep, Mrs. 
 S., and as for the rest ofTne seeds, sweep them iuto the re- 
 fuse basket. I will add another stick to the fire, pare an 
 apple for you, and an apple for me, light a cigar, and bo 
 comfortable. What is the use of fretting about a few seeds 
 more or less? But, next year, we will mark all the packa- 
 ges with names, to prevent mistakes, won't we, Mrs. Sparrow- 
 grass?" — Putnam's Monthly.

Barbraham Sheep Letting. 
 The annual letting of Jonos Webb's South Down rams came 
 off on the 22d ult. There were 207 rams penned, and 77 fell 
 under tho hammer. The total produce of the letting was 
 £l,9S3,9s, the average price being £25, 15,2 ($123,62) each. 
 This is a higher average price than any previous year. Tho 
 second ram led into the ring excited a most spirited competi- 
 tion, tho last biddings being between the Agent of the Duke 
 of Richmond and Mr. Overhaul of Norfolk. It was knocked 
 down to tho former at tho uprecedented price of 170 guineas 
 ($856,80.) Mr. Overman obtained the next higest ram at ISO 
 guineas. Last year the highest price paid was 102 guineas 
 ($514) by Mr. Lugar of Hargrave, Eng. In 1853, Mr. Jon- 
 athan Thorne, Thornedale Duchess Co., N.Y., carried off the 
 highest priced sheep for $655 Up to that time, we believe, 
 this was the highest figure that a South Down sheep ever let 
 before. Some of Bakewell's inproved Leicesters have brought 
 a little more, if we recollect rightly. Will some one inform 
 us on this point. — Country Gentleman*.
