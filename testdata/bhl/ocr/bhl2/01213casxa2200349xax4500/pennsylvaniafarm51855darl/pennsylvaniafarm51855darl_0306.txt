THE FARM JOURNAL. 

[October 

French to $6,000,000, the English to $4,000,000, and 
 the American to some $2,500,000 — a clear national sav- 
 ing of $17,500,000 per annum in the cost of thrashing 
 and winnowing our small grain alone ! And the saving 
 to France from the substitution of Pitt's thrasher for the 
 best of her own invention can hardly be less than ten 
 millions of dollars per annum. 

So with regard to reapers. The time required for 
 cutting equal portions of heavy and badly lodged wheat 
 by the several European machines, ranged from half an 
 hour to an hour and a half, while the three American 
 machines cut an equal area as follows : 

Hussey's, (with Wright's improvements,) in 18 min- 
 utes. 

Manny's, (an Illinois machine,) in 16 minutes. 

McCormick's, (operated by McKenzie,) in 10 J min- 
 utes. 

We venture to say that this last was the quickest time 
 ever made in cutting grain, even though we assume that 
 the area was not more than two-thirds of an acre. And, 
 without at all detracting from the merits of the victori- 
 ous machine, we believe a share of the credit is due to 
 J. C. McKenzie — a thorough Yankee, who won the tri- 
 umph for McCorinick in Sjigland, at Mechi's farm, in 
 1851 — and who, as a manager and operator of this class 
 of machinery, has no superior. There are probably not 
 five men living who could have raked off the cut grain 
 into sheaf-armfuls at the unprecedented speed of Mc- 
 Cormick's reaper in the recent trial. 

It thus appears that, in the public official testing of 
 both reaping and thrashing machines, open to all the 
 world, and in which all the good machines of Europe 
 must necessarily have been represented, every American 
 machine entered, proved immensely superior to every Euro- 
 pean machine. That is to say : of our four reaping or 
 thrashing machines sent to Paris to compete with the 
 thirty or forty best machines of Europe, each one of our 
 four proved superior to the best rival machines that Eu- 
 rope could produce! So complete a national triumph 
 was never before achieved in any world wide arena of 
 Industrial competition. 

Breeds of Poultry. 

However extravagant and suddenly an excitement may 
 be gotten up in respect to the merits of any new breed 
 of animals, whether poultry, pigs, or neat cattle, it may 
 be received as a truth that "when the people think long 
 they mostly think right." Public opinion at last general- 
 ly settles down about where it ought to be, and affixes to 
 each breed its proper position. The Shanghai, or Co- 
 chin China, fever appears to have entirely abated in 
 England. At the recent exhibition of the Royal Agri- 
 cultural Society at Carlisle, the entries of Cochin Chinas 
 were but fifteen, having been fifty of the previous year, 
 and the result would seem to be, as expressed by the 
 editor of the English Agricultural Gazette, "that the 
 Dorking maintains his ground as the most valuable breed 
 we possess, and the game fowl also much esteemed." 
 The entries of the different breeds were as follows: 
 Spanish fowls 17, Dorkings 51, Cochin Chinas 15, Malay 
 3, Game 32, Hamburgs 27, Polish 9. 

The above may be taken as an index in England of 
 popular feeling with respect to the various breeds. 

Great Drover. — Jacob Strawn. 

The papers frequently mention this wonderfully success- 
 ful farmer and drover, who emigrated, some time since, from 
 Muskingum county, in this State, to Illinois. In a letter to 
 the Tribune, a correspondent thus tells of him : 

In the vicinity of Jacksonville is the most noted man in 
 Illinois, not excepting the "little giant." I am told that 
 he is a native of Muskingum county, Ohio, and that he em- 
 igrated to the prairies many years ago, with money enough 
 to buy a quarter section of land. He is of medium stature, 
 but his frame has been of immenso power and toughness. 
 Sometimes, when he has been purchasing cattle, he has ac- 
 complished the almost incredible feat of riding on horse- 
 back nine successive days and nights, with no sleep but 
 what he got in the saddle. His judgment of cattle is almost 
 infallible. He will ride into a drove of cattle, glance over 
 it with incredible quickness, hunting tho number, singling 
 out the average ox, computing from him the whole drove, 
 and offering a price for the whole more promptly than many 
 would for one ox. He has the reputation of being a fair 
 dealer, and will not haggle with those who sell to or buy of 
 him. If his customers like his terms, that ends the matter; 
 and if not, it certainly ends it. He measures out his plans 
 weeks ahead, by tho half hour, never failing in his engage- 
 ments, and never forgiving the laggard who keeps him 
 waiting. His cattle business enlarged enormously, until he 
 purchased and sold many thousands a year. All the money 
 not needed in his business was invested in lands, and it is 
 said he has never been known to sell an acre. His home 
 farm contains ten thousand acres, and a gentleman told me 
 that one field on that farm, planted year after year with 
 corn, contains three thousand acres, and another four thou- 
 sand. And besides these, many smaller ones of a section, 
 less or more. His landed estate is said to be worth a million 
 of dollars. 

His mode of dealing with tenants is characteristic. He 
 assigns them certain tracts, and tells them ho wants them 
 to put in so many acres of corn, agreeing, if they work well, 
 to pay them so much a bushel for the crop when ripe. In 
 the fall he brings each man his money, and then drives to 
 each man a certain number of cattle and hogs, and says : 
 "I will pay you so much a head to feed these, this winter, 
 all they can eat, and you are to have them at my house on 
 the 1st day of next May." On the specified day his droves 
 are coming in from all directions, and buyers from the East- 
 ern cities are there attending the greatest cattle market of 
 the West, if not in America. The beef cattle on the grounds 
 amount to thousands, and the drovers are able to get just 
 what they want. And what is singular, this man never 
 keeps book accounts, retaining the minutest details of his 
 immense business in his memory, and filling up his engage- 
 ments with porfect exactness. 

A few years since such protracted tasking of mind and 
 body broke him down, and I am told that he is showing too 
 many signs of age for a man said to be not over 60. In 
 some respects he is the most remarkable man in all Illinois, 
 the like of whom will not soon be seen again. His name is 
 Jacob Strawn. 

Blanketing Cows. 

A correspondent of the Rural Intelligencer has been trav- 
 elling through Holland, and says : 

Great care is taken of their cows, both in the winter and 
 in the summer ; and in a lowery wet day, you will see the 
 cows in tho field covered with blankets; aye, even more 
 commonly than a horse is blanketed here in the winter. 
 This care is well repaid by a greater flow of milk and a less 
 consumption of forage.
