delicate hot-house plants to their vast plantations of largo 
 and thrifty fruit trees. Indeed there seems to be a sort of 
 magic in all their attempts at propagation, so rarely are 
 there any failures. 

The reason of this remarkable success is their thorough 
 experience and knowledge of the requisites for every opera- 
 tion, and an excellent soil, redueed to the best condition by 
 subsoiling and constant tillage. A weed is a great rarity 
 on their grounds. 

The cost of conducting this establishment must of course 
 be very great — although we have no definite information on 
 he subject, we should judge from the estimates mentioned 
 in the early part of this article, that they must amount to 
 fifty thousand dollars annually. Their sales may be esti- 
 mated from the same data, remembering that none are more 
 successful, and that probably no nursery is better managed 
 for pecuniary success. 

There are several other nurseries at Rochester, of large 
 size, which we were unable to visit — among which those of 
 H. E. Hooker & Co., Frost & Co., and S. Moulson, are 
 widely celebrated, each containing, as we have been inform- 
 ed, a hundred acres or more. 

Since writing the foregoing, Ellwanger & Barry have, at 
 our request, furnished the following statement of the num- 
 ber of acres occupied by each crop on their grounds.

Patent Stump Puller. 

Among the visits made by us during the present month to 
 the homes of the farmers in various parts of this State and 
 New Hampshire was ono to Orange, Mass., to witness the 
 operations of the eighth wonder of the world the Patent Stump 
 Puller, owned and operated by W. W. Willis, of that town. 
 Notice of trial had been given, so that persons assembled 
 from adjoining towns and a few had come from remote dis- 
 tances. 

At ten o clock the hook of a stout chain was placed under 
 the root of a moderately sized stump, and it was turned out 
 with as much apparent ease as though it had been a mere log 
 with no attachments to the ground. Other stumps of still 
 larger and more extensive roots were then taken out, and all 
 with certainty, and without the slightest confusion — the time 
 occupied in removing each one after the chain was applied, 
 not exceeding ten minutes. 

At length the visitors having multiplied to quite a crowd, 
 a larger chain was attached, an enormous stump, the growth 
 perhaps of centuries, was selected. With a small, half circular 
 spade, room was made under one of the roots, and a stout hook 
 attached. Nearly the whole surface of the ground about the 
 stump was covered with stumps of a latter growth of youi g 
 pines, whose roots penetrated the soil and mingled with those 

of their ancient progenitor. The stump itself was between 
 two and three feet in diameter, as were its roots. 

A pair of stout oxen were then hitched to the lever, and 
 driven forward. When they had advanced some three or 
 four rods, the chain was taken up, and they were turned 
 back without unhitching, the roots in the machine cracking 
 and making a noise like a pistol exploded under water. The 
 ground gradually arose about the stump, and in five minutes 
 its gnarly root's which had securely lain there for ages, were 
 brought to light. At the expiration of ten minutes the old 
 hero was fairly turned over, and the roots on the upper side 
 pointed to heaven ! Upon actual measurement, we found the 
 roots extending something more than 16 feet from each side 
 of the stump. 

A gentleman from Valparaiso who accompanied us, and 
 who is intrusted by the Chilian Government with funds to pur- 
 chase agricultural implements, after witnessingthe exhibition, 
 at onoe ordered three of the machines to be sent to his coun- 
 try. 

The experiment was one of the most astonishing exhibi- 
 tions of mechanical power that we have ever witnesed. The 
 machine is exceedingly simple, and not liable to get out af 
 repair. — N. E. Farmer. 

Missouri Challenging the Union. 

In a Missouri periodical, the Valley Farmer, appears the 
 following challenge from the proprietors of the Sigerson 
 Farm, near St. Louis : — 

Missouri Challenges the United States ! — The un- 
 dersigned, believing that their farm, situated seven miles 
 south of St Louis, Mo., is unequalled in point of variety, 
 production aud extent, by any other in the United States, 
 (though it has been in cultivation less than ten years,) chal- 
 lenge the whole Union, to a competition for a grand sweep- 
 stake premium on the following conditions : 

Each person competing shall deposit five hundred dollars, 
 to be used as hereafter specified. 

Entries of farms to be made prior to September 1, 1855. 

A committee to consist of one person from each State in 
 which any farm or farms shall be entered, shall bo selected 
 by the Governor of the respective States represented, whose 
 duty, when so selected and notified by the Governor, shall 
 be, to proceed and visit each farm so entered, during the 
 months of September and October, and award the premium 
 to the owner of the farm which shall excel in these particu- 
 lars, viz : 

Variety of production. 

Amount of productions, and 

Extent of surface cultivated. 

The premium shall consist of a service of plate to be pur- 
 chased with the money deposited by all the competitors, 
 after the oxpenses of the committee have been paid. 

We are anxious to let the world know what has been and 
 "what can be done west of the Mississippi river, and make 
 this offer in good faith, and with a full determination to carry 
 it out. 

All necessary preliminary arrangements will be made in 
 a liberal manner. Who will enter the list? 

Communications with reference to the above, may be 
 made directly to us at St. Louis, or to E. Abbott, Esq., odi- 
 tor of the Valley Farmer, St. Louis, Mo. 

Pledging ourselves that all such shall meet with prompt 
 and respectful attention. Very respectfully, 

John Sigerson & Brother. 

St. Louis, Mo., June 1, 1855. 

That those who think of engaging in this competition 
 may know what they have to contend with, we copy from 
 the St. Louis Democrat of the 13th inst., the following account
