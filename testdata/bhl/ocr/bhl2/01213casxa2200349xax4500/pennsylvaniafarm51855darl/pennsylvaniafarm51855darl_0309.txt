of the Sigerson farm by a correspondent of that journal: 

Statistics will better show its proportions than elaborate 
 descriptions of scenery. 400 acres of pasture, grove and 
 lawn — 150 acres of meadow, 86 of wheat, 65 of oats and rye, 
 corn and potatoes enough to supply the numerous family and 
 stock — nine miles of Osage Orange hedge, well trimmed, 
 and much of it large enough to turn cattle, adds greatly to 
 the picturesque beauty of the rolling prairie; enclosing pas- 
 tures, orchards, nurseries, flower-gardens, and fields — ver- 
 dant net-work binding all together, protecting and ornamen- 
 ting at the same time. There are two hundred acres of 
 orchard just coming into vigorous usefulness — eight thous- 
 and peach and apricot trees, and, from present appearances, 
 some of them will give many a rich treat ere the wintry 
 winds sweep over us again. Pear, apple, plum and cherry, 
 bear swift witness of the "good time coming." 

Twenty-five acres of strawberries have already given our 
 St. Louisans a foretaste of the future, and dozens of men 
 are now engaged replacing the old beds, and enlarging them 
 by the acre. Three hundred thousand grape-cuttings have 
 been sot out this spring, and most of them are doing well — 
 fosty thousand evergreens in fine and fresh condition — two 
 hundred and ten thousand quince trees are ready for the 
 budding of pears — twenty bushels of peach stones and seven 
 bushels of apple seeds have this season been planted, and 
 acres are covered with the uprising life. A great variety of 
 forest trees are cultivated for the market, and it would be 
 easier, perhaps, to tell what the Messrs. Sigersons have not, 
 that is indigenous to this climate, than to enumerate what 
 they have. 

The substantial stone farm house is surrounded by a large 
 door-yard, which is reached from the stone road by a serpen- 
 tine road through a wooden lawn. A semi-circle avenue bor- 
 dered by cedars, snow-balls and lilacs, leads to the door, 
 where kind hospitality and a farmer's welcome meet the 
 numerous visitants that through the summer months throng 
 the place to breathe the fragrant air, and luxuriate for a brief 
 hour in the beauty and flowers. Parterres of choice flowers, 
 nurseries of roses blossom in the sun by the half acre. 
 Borders, walks, summer-houses, arbors, vines on every hand 
 in magnitude of magnificence that keep you all the while in 
 wonder and admiration, and form a whole that must be seen 
 to be appreciated, and has seldom if ever been surpassed. 
 The whole stock of trees, shrubs, vines and evergreens, 
 number two millions, (Mr. Sigerson says it is nearer three 
 millions, but he puts it down two millions, lest the incredu- 
 lous should be frightened at its vastness of number, and set 
 the whole down as a fable.) 

We spent two and ahalf hours riding through the grounds, 
 and examining the fields, pastures, orchards, lawns, meadows 
 garden, shrubbery — looked down into the wells, examined 
 the spring, the stone quarry, saw the fine Durhams, the 
 good horses, listened and laughed at the proud, gutteral crow 
 of Monsieur Shanghai, heard Madame Poland cackle — and 
 returned convinced that we have not seen all, and that no 
 one can truly realize the extent of the farm, or its high state 
 of culture, and the labor and expenses necessary to keep it 
 in progress, that has not taken a ride through its shady 
 drives, its bordered avenues and hedge lanes. 

A Fact in Regard to Drilling Wheat. 
 We wish to record a fact which seems rather remarkable in 
 regard to drilling in wheat. We sowed about nine acres last 
 fall with one of Ross' Drills, and some three acres among 
 corn, with a three shovel cultivator. Of the former, we have 
 not noticed a single plant heaved out with the frost dur- 
 ing the winter, though a part of it was sown on the poorest 
 clay land on the farm, with but one plowing. It was sown 

immediately before that among the corn, and presented in 
 the early winter a decidedly poor prospect. But that .sown 
 among corn is badly killed with winter, many plants lying 
 on the top of the ground, dead. In some places, it seems al- 
 most entirely ruined. It is the same kind of wheat as that 
 which was drilled. Our readers may draw their own conclu- 
 sions. — Indiana Farmer. 

Timothy. 

Have you not, Messrs. Editors, inquired oftenor than you 
 can tell the origin of the name of the grass called Timothy? 
 I have. Have not yet oftener heard the question asked 
 without any answer being given? I found the following in 
 a little beautiful, interesting and useful book entitled The 
 Green Fields and their Grasses, by Anne Pratt, London. 

" There are several species, two of the cats-tail grass. 
 One only is very common, but that one is to be found in 
 every meadow. It is the common eats-tail or Timothy grass 
 (Phleum pratense). This latter name it received from Tim- 
 othy Hanson, who introduced it from New-York and Caro- 
 lina, about the year 1780." A Subscriber. — Country Gen- 
 tleman. 

Quince Trees. 
 There is probably not a single Quince Orchard in Penn- 
 sylvania. We have never chanced to see in any part of the 
 State quince trees, excepting in some obscure corner of 
 the field or garden, entirely neglected, never pruned, 
 manured or cultivated. A stranger aware of the fact 
 that good quinces always sell readily in Philadelphia 
 market, and at a comparatively higher price than other 
 fruit, knowing also that hundreds of barrels, perhaps 
 thousands, are brought here for sale in the fall of the 
 year from north and east of us, would suppose our soil 
 not adapted to quince culture. This is not the case. 
 There is no fruit which, in Pennsylvania, would pay 
 better than the quince, if properly cultivated. They 
 produce abundantly, come into profit in about three 
 years after planting, are hardy, require but little atten- 
 tion, can be placed closer together than most other fruit 
 trees, the fruit is more easily picked, and will better 
 bear transportation. An idea is very prevalent that 
 they do better on low moist ground. This is a mistake, 
 originating from the fact that they will thrive in such 
 situations when other trees will not. The quince will 
 do as well on high dry ground as the pear tree. To do 
 it justice, it should receive every fall a good coat of 
 barnyard manure well dug in, the bark should be 
 cleansed occasionally with the lye mixture, as recom- 
 mended for other fruit trees, and attention should be 
 given to pruning all decayed wood or crowded branches, 
 so as to give free access to the sun and air, and make a 
 good symmetrical head. 

One of the best manures for the quince tree is salt, 
 which should be strewn over the ground every spring in 
 the proportion of two or three quarts to each tree. 
 This has been fully tried, and found to increase the lux- 
 uriance of the foliage and quality of the fruit. It is the 
 special manure for this tree, and should never be omitted. 
 The quince may be planted in rows ten feet apart, which 
 will give four hundred trees to the acre. Two bushels 
 to the tree, and $1,50 per bushel, which is a low esti- 
 mate, will make a return of over $1200 to the acre. 

The orange or apple quince is the most profitable va- 
 riety.
