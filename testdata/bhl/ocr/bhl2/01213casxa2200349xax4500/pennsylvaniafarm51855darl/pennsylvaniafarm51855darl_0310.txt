GAS FOR COUNTRY RESIDENCES. 
 The great convenience, and, under many circum- 
 stances, economy, as well as safety, of introducing gas 
 light into country residences, have induced us to insert 
 the accompanying cuts, to illustrate some gas fixtures 
 manufactured in this city, which several of our friends 
 in the country have had erected on their faims, and 
 • which operate to entire satisfaction. They are made of 
 a two sizes, the large one beiug set up for $G50, and the 
 I other for $350, exclusive of gas pipes and burners. 

The gas is manufactured from resin, one pound of resin 
 making nine cubic feet of gas. The works are capable 
 of making one hundred cubic feet of gas per hour. One 
 and a half bushels of anthracite coal will produce heat 
 enough to make eight hundred cubic feet of gas, and one 
 of our friends, who has the apparatus on his place, esti- 
 mates the cost at $2,37 per one thousand feet. 

Two medals have been awarded to the inventor by the 
 Franklin Institute of Philadelphia.

 placed under the resin holder, h, where the resin is I covering the outlet pipe, through which the gas passes

 bars ; e, a plate near the top of the stove, to spread the 
 heat to the ends of the retort; F, a sliding damper, by 
 which the heat may be thrown directly under the resin 
 holder or up the chimney ; j is a funnel and descending 
 tube ; k, an ascending tube, rising from the front end of 

the retort and extending an inch or two above the lower 
 end of j ; l, a retort of a ~ form, with the arch spring- 
 ing high from its sides, the bottom flat ; p p, clamps se-
