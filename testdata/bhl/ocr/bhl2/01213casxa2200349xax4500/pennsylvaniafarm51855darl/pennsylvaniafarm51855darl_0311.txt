* Before we proceed with our exposition of the anatomy 
 and functions of plants, it is proper carefully to examine 
 that peculiar investment which covers them, termed by 
 physiologists 

The Epidermis. â€” Every part of a plant as well as of 
 an animal, with the exception of the stigma or top of 
 the pistil and the extremities of the roots, is covered by 
 this thin membrenaceous integument. It usually con- 
 sists of two parts: 1st, an outward pellicle without ap- 
 preciable organization, called the cuticle ; 2d, one or 
 more strata of flattened tabular cells, which are much 
 larger than the cells of the subjacent tissue, constituting 
 the true epidermis or skin. These two superposed 
 membranes are intimately united and pierced by a num- 
 ber of apertures termed stomata or pores. The epi- 
 dermis of plants is without chlorophyl, and may be 
 readily detached from the subjacent tissues in the form 
 of a thin transparent layer. 

If the leaves of the cabbage, iris, or lily, be macerated 
 in water for a few days, there may be separated from 
 them a thin, continuous, and non-cellular membrane. 
 This is the cuticle. All the points of this membrane 
 fwhich correspond to the pores are pierced with openings 
 n the form of button holes. When the subjacent epi- 
 dermis has hairs on its surface, these are also covered 
 with the cuticle, which, when it is detached from the 
 epidermis, presents on its surface prolongations having 
 the form of these hairs.

 covering the hairs h, and having openings s correspond- 
 ing to the stomata. 

The existence of the cuticle on the epidermis of plants 
 in the form of a perfectly distinct membrane, was first 
 announced to the world by Benedict de Saussure in 
 1762; since that period it has been proved true by Hed- 
 wig in 1793, and by M. Adolphus Brongniart in 1834, 
 who called the attention of anatomists to this point in 
 his beautiful memoir on the structure of leaves. 

The cuticle is the only part of the epidermis covering 
 the surface of aquatic plants which remain constantly 
 plunged in the water. Few pei'sons are aware that 
 aquatic plants are clothed in water-proof garments. 
 The cuticle is developed on them in the form of a glau- 
 cous bloom or vegetable wax, which renders their exte- 
 rior surface a perfect water-shed, thus preventing them 

from obtaining an injurious amount of the fluid in which 
 they float. If the reader attempts to wet the leaves of 
 the {Nuphar advena) or common spatterdock of the pools, 
 he will see the water roll off like quicksilver globules 
 from a plate of glass. 

The epidermis may be readily perceived to be a mem- 
 brane perfectly distinct from the cellular and fibrous 
 tissue which it covers, with which it contracts but a fee- 
 ble adhesion, and from which it is easily separated in 
 the form of a colorless transparent layer. The epider- 
 mis of plants is clearly intended to guard their subja- 
 cent vascular and cellular systems from injury, and to 
 control the evaporation of their fluids within due 
 bounds. 

In the lily and balsam, which allow of ready evapora- 
 tion, the epidermis consists of a single layer of cells ; 
 but in plants which inhabit dry situations, it is so con- 
 structed as to retard evaporation, and either consists of 
 several layers of cells, as in the oleander, or else is of 
 considerable thickness, as in the aloe and cactus. By 
 this provision, these plants are enabled to retain their 
 moisture for a greater length of time.

 the oleander, showing the thickness of the epidermis, 
 which is composed of three layers of cells, and the com- 
 pact vertical cells of the upper stratum of parenchyma, 
 or green cellular tissue of the leaf. 

It must be evident that the exhalation of water from 
 the leaves is to a certain extent necessary, as it is the 
 only means by which the sap can be concentrated and 
 rendered subservient to the nutrition of the plant. Now 
 so long as the roots can absorb as much water as the 
 leaves evaporate, the plant will appear fresh and green, 
 but the foliage droops (as is often seen on a hot sum- 
 mer's day towards noon, ) when the evaporation from the 
 leaves exceeds the supply at the roots. A copious sup- 
 ply of water, however, usually accumulates on the leaves 
 during the cloudless nights of summer, which is absorb- 
 ed through the pores on their surface into their organ- 
 ism, and in the morning the plants refreshed by the night 
 dews, have assumed their wonted rapidity and freshness. 
 In this case the only absorbents are the stomata on the 
 epidermis. How beautiful this provision of nature, 
 which, at the time that the soil is dried to dust, causes 
 the moisture to distil from the atmosphere on every 
 forest leaf and blade of grass in gently descending dews, 
 to remedy as it were in some measure the evils arising 
 from an insufficiency of water in the soil. 

The stomata or pores of plants vary in their figure 
 and size. They are, however, usually of an oval figure 
 with a slit in the middle, and are so situated as to open 
 directly into the intercellular spaces of the paren- 
 chyma. These pores may be called the vegetable gov- 
 ernor. They regulate and control the evaporation from 
 the surface of plants, thus promoting a healthy passage 
 of the fluids through the system.
