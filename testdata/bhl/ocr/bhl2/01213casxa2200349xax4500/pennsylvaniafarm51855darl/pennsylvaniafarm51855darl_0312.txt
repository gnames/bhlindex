This is done on the following principle. The slit or 
 perforation in the epidermal surface lies between two 
 cells, which differ from each other in being very hygo- 
 metrical, or easily affected by the moisture of the atmos- 
 phere. When the air is damp, and there is an abun- 
 dance of moisture in the ground, these two cells become 
 swollen and turgid, and by their outward curvature 
 open the pore and allow the escape of the superfluous 
 water; but when the atmosphere is dry they straighten 
 and lie parallel, their sides being brought into close con- 
 tact. The pore is thus closed, and the evaporation 
 stopped the moment it becomes injurious to the plant.

 mata st, composed of two cells, with an opening or slit 
 between them. 

The structure of the stomata or pores of plants may 
 be readily perceived on the epidei-mis of the lily, where 
 they are unusually large. The epidermis must be first 
 carefully removed from one of the leaves, and having 
 been freed from all its chlorophyl, or green matter, it 
 must be placed between two slips of glass, with a drop 
 of water between them, so as to give it the necessary 
 degree of transparency. Water ought always for this 
 reason to be used, whenever objects selected from the 
 tissues of plants are examined microscopically. The 
 epidermis, thus prepared, will exhibit these pores, and 
 the nature and beauty of their mechanism will be seen 
 and appreciated. 

Stomata are generally found on the under surface of 
 the leaves, the mechanism being too delicate to act well 
 in the direct sunshine. They are invariably absent from 
 the parts of plants growing beneath the water. The 
 water lilies and all plants with floating leaves have the 
 stomata on their upper surface. 

Stomata are more or less abundant on the cuticle of 
 all plants, and as plants perspire through these aper- 
 tures in proportion to their number on different plants, 
 is it necessary to supply them with water. The plant 
 called Hydrangea guercifolia has on one square inch 
 oT its surface 160,000 pores, and therefore requires a 
 greater supply of water than plants possessed of from 
 70 to 100 pores on the same superfices. The rapidity 
 with which plants wither and dry when not watered, is 
 exactly in proportion to the number of their exhaling 
 pores. 

It must be evident to all practical men, from these 
 facts, that it is of some importance to keep the leaves of 

plants free from all impurities, which are apt to accu- 
 mulate on their surface and thus choke up their porous 
 openings. During dry seasons a supply of water to the 
 leaves is of as much importance as a moistened soil. 
 House plants frequently suffer from the dust with which 
 their leaves become covered. Their health and general 
 appearance may be very much improved by a careful 
 cleansing of their leaves every other day with a wet 
 sponge. It is as important to keep the epidermis of a 
 plant in a cleanly state as the skin of an animal. Ne- 
 glect in either instance brings on disease, premature 
 decay, and loss of vitality. 

United States Agricultural Society's Exhibition. 

We have received the following communication from 
 the Secretary of the United States Agricultural Society 
 at Boston, which speaks for itself. The style and com- 
 pleteness with which in those diggings they go through 
 with any thing they undertake, is a caution as well as 
 an example to the rest of the country. Is this to be 
 wondered at when they have a "King" there to facili- 
 tate the arrangements, who is not only fond of such 
 sport himself, but, if necessary, can be backed up by 
 one still " Wilder," and who is favorably known over the 
 length and breadth of the land ? Can a plain republican 
 manager be expected to equal a King? We can hardly 
 indulge the expectation of occupying one of the seats 
 provided for the five thousand spectators, although there 
 will be many things there we should like to see and hear. 
 We wish our friends there the best success. 

Secretary's Office, U. S. Agricultural'Society, 1 
 Boston, September 10th, 1855. j 

Mr. Editor : — Dear Sir : — Your note of enquiry as to 
 the Show of the United States Agricultural Society, to 
 be holden in Boston on the 23d, 24th, 25th and 26th 
 days of October next, was duly received ; and of such 
 arrangements as are already made or decided upon, I 
 hasten to advise you. 

The show grounds are situated in the limits of Boston 
 within reasonable walking distance of any part of the 
 city, but ample facilities will be provided for those who 
 prefer (and who does not ?) to ride. A fine public square, 
 generously granted by the corporation for the purposes 
 of the exhibition, has been graded to a perfect level, and 
 will be enclosed by a tight board fence ten feet high. 
 Within this enclosure a one-half mile track for the trial 
 of horses will be carefully prepared ; its curves are such 
 as one engineer assures us that a locomotive can describe 
 them at the top of speed, consequently locomotive quad- 
 rupeds can with ease put out their full powers without 
 " breaking up" as on many courses too often happens, to 
 the damage of the horse's reputation for speed, the an- 
 noyance of drivers, and the disappointment of "the 
 crowd." 

On the north, east and south sides of the grounds, ad- 
 joining the fence, will be erected stables for the stock 
 extending over three thousand feet, with inner lines of 
 stalls at either end of the track. 

In the accommodations for animals, we have adopted 
 many of the best features of English shows, which I, at 
 least, have not seen copied in this country. The effect 
 to the observer will be fine ; and the occupants in no 
 whit lose by the change.
