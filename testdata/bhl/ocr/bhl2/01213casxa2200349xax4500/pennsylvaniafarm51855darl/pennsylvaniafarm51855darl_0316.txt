ence being that of a few inches in size. With such incon- 
 testable evidence of the valuo of private examinations, would 
 it not be well for all State Societies to adopt the plan, making 
 it obligatory upon the committees to ask no questions of 
 exhibitors or inventors? 

But seriously, are we accomplishing the object aimed at by 
 our Agricultural Societies, in permitting the decisions of 
 committees such as the one above alluded to, to be given to 
 the world, and carrying with them the sanction of the 
 Societies under whose auspices they act? How is it possible 
 for any man or set of men to decide properly upon the merits 
 of fifty different machines, more or less complicated, each 
 one involving some new principle or combination of princi- 
 ples, unless they have a full and fair opportunity of testing 
 their merits by actual practical experiment? Is it not 
 supremely ridiculous to suppose that any thing like a correct 
 conclusion can be arrived at from the trifling examination 
 usually bestowed upon such machines ? They may or may 
 not award the premium to the best machine, but the chances 
 are as many in favor of the worst as the best. Can purchasers 
 rely upon these decisions? Assuredly not. What then is 
 their value? Absolutely worse than nothing, for they are 
 apt to deceive, and thus defeat the very object of the 
 exhibition. What is the remedy? I know of no one com- 
 pletely effectual. Something would be gained by making 
 practical experiment and operation on tho ground a positive 
 requirement, though this would not fully reach the object. 
 Shall we not have this subject discussed, with the hope that 
 something will be elicited which will correct our present 
 very defective system of awards before another exhibition 
 season arrives. Unless some change is made, I venture the 
 prediction that in a very few years our agricultural exhibi- 
 tions, at least so far as implements and machinery are 
 concerned, will either become ridiculous farces, or be wholly 
 abandoned. A SUB-COMMITTEE MAN.

Value of Subsoil. 
 L. Damon, of West Chester, recently called our atten- 
 tion to the productiveness of what farmers generally con- 
 sider barren and worthless subsoil, and which they dread 
 bo much to bring to the surface in their fields and gar- 
 dens. In the recent erection of a foundry and machine 
 shop on his property in the borough, he had occasion to 
 take entirely away the surface soil to the depth of two 
 and a half feet. Not supposing any thing could be made 

to grow aud mature there, and merely wishing to obscure 
 the yellow clay with any kind of green vegetation, he 
 planted cabbages and beets, using a very small quantity 
 of almost dry litter from the stable, which happened to 
 be on hand. 

To his surprise and that of his neighbors, they grew 
 most luxuriantly, the cabbages measuring across their 
 very hard and solid heads, without counting any outside 
 leaves, fully fourteen inches, and the beets equally large 
 in proportion. We have often heard of similar cases. 
 The subsoil or substrata of our farms often consists of a 
 very mine of wealth, abundance of the inorganic food of 
 plants, the very material of growth and vigor, which 
 they often stand most in need of. Still it is suffered to 
 lie idle year after year. When will farmers awake to 
 their true interests, and adopt the habit of plowing deep, 
 thus renovating their worn out soils ? It should be re- 
 collected that, in addition to the mineral constituents of 
 this substratum, which are indispensable to the growth 
 of plants, it has also for many years been receiving the 
 washings of the rich surface soil, and thus contains in a 
 greater or less degree nearly all the elements of fertility. 

There can be no really good and profitable farming 
 without a deep soil, and there cannot be a deep soil 
 without deep plowing.

Sweet Scented Vernal Grass. 
 Those who sow grass seeds intended to produce per- 
 manent pasturage, should intermix some of the sweet 
 scented vernal grass, which constitutes an essential part 
 of all the best pasture grounds and meadows in England, 
 Ireland, and other portions of Europe. It is naturalized 
 in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, where it contributes 
 that fine flavor to spring or May butter for which the 
 city market is so famous. It gives the earliest bite in 
 spring, whilst the aftermath affords excellent pasturage 
 in autumn. Taken alone it is not recommended as a hay 
 grass, although a mixture gives the hay that peculiarly 
 agreeable flavor for which European hay is distinguish- 
 ed. The seed is very light, weighing only about five or 
 six pounds to the bushel. E.

Renovation of Old Fruit Trees. 
 Passing a few daj's recently at the house of a friend 
 in one of the Eastern States, my attention was drawn to 
 a large pear tree, the body of which bore the appearance 
 of great age, while the top was becoming renewed with 
 young and healthy branches, and producing a variety of 
 choice pears. I found my friend was in the practice of 
 heading down his aged and decaying fruit trees, digging 
 about, scraping and washing them, and then grafting 
 with choice fruit the smaller branches or limbs, as also 
 the new shoots, which would soon appear when the old 
 and declining limbs were removed. This tree had been 
 of little value, producing nothing but a small hard fruit 
 which he called the button pear. His mother remem 
 bered it as an old tree sixty years before. The same 
 friend informed me that a neighbor of his had six old 
 trees bearing nothing but natural fruit, (choke pears.) 
 almost worthless for man or beast. Five or six years 
 since he headed them down and grafted them with the 
 Bartlett pear. The present season he had taken thirty
