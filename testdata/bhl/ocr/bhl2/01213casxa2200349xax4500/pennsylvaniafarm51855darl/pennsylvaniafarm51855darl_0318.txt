much more regularly and quickly than by the common 
 method. He also recommends very strongly the prac- 
 tice of sovring the seed where the hedge is intended to 
 be, instead of setting out the plants, and that trimming 
 should be done but once a year, so as to give size and 
 strength to both stem and root, and secure the benefit of 
 the whole season's growth. 

The above views, containing the best experience of a 
 district where hundreds of miles of Osage Orange hedg- 
 ing have been planted out, are well worthy of attention. 
 To those who design to plant the coming spring we 

would say, plow the headland the present fall of the 
 proper width with the double Michigan plow, twelve 
 inches deep ; let it lay exposed to the action of the frost 
 during winter, and in the spring, if the soil is thin, give 
 it a coating of manure, and plow down a shallow furrow. 
 Then harrow and pulverize thoroughly, and drill the 
 seed, as suggested above. We believe Osage Orange to 
 be the hedge plant for the Middle, Southern and Western 
 States, and that by its general use, at least for all out- 
 side fences, millions of dollars would be saved to the 
 country. 

'ASTORIA.' 

"Astoria" is the property of B. & C. S. Haines, Eliz- 
 abeth, New Jersey. Color, red and white. Sire, im- 
 ported Duke of Exeter (10152) ; dam, Creampot 6th by 
 Pontiac, A. H. B., (125) ; g. d. Creampot 4th by Guari- 
 oney, A. H. B, (68) ; gr. g. d. Creampot by imported 
 Lord Althorp ; gr. gr. g. d. Flora Hills by Young 
 Eclipse ; gr. gr. gr. g. d. imported Jenny â€” winner of 
 the first prize in the class of yearling bulls at the show 
 of the American Institute in 1851 ; also, first prize in 
 the class of two year old bulls at the American Institute 
 and Queens County Show in 1852 ; also, the first prize 
 in the class of bulls from other States at the New York 
 State Show in 1854. 

The above beautiful engraving of the very superior 
 bull "Astoria" was forwarded us by his owners, the 
 Messrs. Haines, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, gentlemen 
 not so extensively known as some other breeders, but 
 whose herd, we are informed, contains some very supe- 
 rior and high bred animals. "Astoria" shows some 
 valuable points, such as extraordinary depth from the 
 top of the shoulder to the termination of the brisket, 
 great length and depth of carcass, heavy and well filled 

hind quarter, and fulness behind the shoulders (a place 
 where many fine animals fall off). His beautifully 
 curved neck and head might by many be thought heavy, 
 but in our opinion are none too much so for a bull. 
 They indicate character and strength, and when accom- 
 panied, as in his case, with a mild eye and countenance, 
 such bulls are much more apt to stamp an individuality 
 on their offspring than others with light, cow-like necks 
 and heads. 

We have by us a pamphlet copy of the Messrs. Haines, 
 containing several other portraits, with pedigrees of their 
 pure bred Short-Horns, some of which we hope hereafter 
 to have for insertion in the Farm Journal. They are by 
 the same artist, J. R. Page, who delineated for L. G. 
 Morris, are in the highest style of the art, and highly 
 creditable to him as well as the engraver, J. W. Orr. 
 Such speaking portraits are calculated to be highly use- 
 ful. 

There is great encouragement at present for breeders 
 of good stock, and it is one of the effects of the rapid 
 settlement and general prosperity of the country, that 
 even with the high price comparatively of farms in the
