Living in the Country, — Experience of Mr. and Mrs. 
 Sparrowgrass. 
 "Mrs. Sparrowgrass," said I, "the weather is beginning 
 to be very warm and spring-like ; how would you like to 
 have a little fcsta f" Mrs. Sparrowgrass said that, in her 
 present frame of mind, a fester was not necessary for her 
 happiness. I replied, " I meant afesta, not a fester; a little 
 fete, a few friends, a few flowers, a mild sort of spring dinner, 
 if you please ; some music, claret, fresh lettuce, lamb and 
 spinach, and a breakfast of eggs fresh laid in the morning, 
 with rice cakes and coffee." Mrs. Sparrowgrass said she 
 was willing. "Then," said I, "Mrs. S., I will invite a few 
 old friends, and we will have an elegant time." So from 
 that day we watched the sky very cleverly for a week to as- 
 certain the probable course of the clouds, and consulted the 
 thermometer to know what chance there was of having open 
 windows for the occasion. The only drawback that stood in 
 the way of perfect enjoyment was, our lawn had been half 
 rooted out of existence by an irruption of predatory pigs. 
 It was vexatious enough to see our lawn bottom-side up on 
 a festive occasion. But I determined to have redress for it. 
 Upon consulting with the best legal authority in the village, 
 I was told that I could obtain damages by identifying the 
 animals, and commencing suit against the owner. As I had 
 not seen the animals, I asked Mrs. Sparrowgrass if she could 
 identify them. She said sho could not. "Then," said I to 
 my legal friend, "what can I do?" He replied that he did 
 not know. "Thon," said I, "if they come again, and I catch 
 them in the act, can I fire a gun among them ?" He said I 
 could ; but that I would be liable for whatever damage was 
 done them. " That," said I, " would not answer ; my object 
 is to make the owner suffer, not the poor quadrupeds." He 
 replied that the only sufferers would probably be the pigs 
 and myself. Then I asked him, if the owner recovered 
 against me, whether I could bring a replevin suit against 
 him. He said that, under the Constitution of the United 
 States, such a suit could be brought. I asked him if I could 
 recover. He said I could not. Ti^n J asked him what 
 remedy I could have. He answered that if I founof the pigs 
 on my grounds, I could drive them to the pound, then call 
 upon the fence viewers, get them to assess the damages done, 
 and by this means mulct the owner for the trespass. This 
 advice pleased me highly; it was practical and humane. I 
 determined to act upon it, and slept soundly upon the reso- 
 lution. The next day our guests came up from town. I 
 explained the law to them, and having been fortified on legal 
 points, instructed them as to remedy for trespass. The day 
 was warm and beautiful; our doors and windows were thrown 
 wide open. By way of offset to the appearance of the lawn, 
 I had contrived, by purchasing an expensive little bijou of a 
 vase, and filling it with sweet breathing flowers to spread a 
 rural air of fragrance throughout the parlor. The doors of 
 the bay-window open on the piazza; in one doorway stood a 
 tray of delicate confections, upon two slender quartette tables. 
 These were put in the shade to keep cool. I had suborned 
 an Italian to bring them up by hand, in pristine sharpness 
 and beauty of outline. I was taking a glass of sherry with 
 our old friend Capt. Bacon, of the U. S. Navy, when suddenly 
 our dogs commenced barking. Wo keep our dogs chained 
 up by daylight. Looking over my glass of sherry, I observed 
 a detachment of the most villainous looking pigs rooting up 
 my early pea-patch. "Now," said I, "Captain," putting 
 down my glass deliberately, "I will show you some fun; 
 excuse me for a few minutes ;" and with that I bowed 
 significantly to our festal guests. They understood at once 
 that etiquette must give way when the pea-patch was about 
 being annihilated. I then went out, unchained the dogs, 
 and commenced driving the pigs out of the garden. After 

considerable trampling of all my early vegetables, under the 
 eyes of my guests, I managed to get the ringleader of the 
 swinish multitude into my parlor. He was a large, power- 
 ful looking fellow, with a great deal of comb, long legs, 
 mottled complexion, and ears pretty well dogged. He stood 
 for a moment at bay against the sofa, then charged upon the 
 dogs, ran against the centre table, which he accidentally 
 upsot, got headed off by Captain Bacon, who came to the 
 rescuo, darted under our quartette tables, — making a general 
 distribution of confectionery, and finally got cornered in tie 
 piazza. 

By this time I was so much exasperated that I was capable 
 of taking the life of the intruder, and probably should have 
 done so had my gun not been at the gunsmith's. In striking 
 at him with a stick, I accidently hit one of the dogs such a 
 blow as to disable him. But I was determined to capture 
 the destroyer and put him in the pound. After some diffi- 
 culty in getting him out of the piazza, I drove him into the 
 library and finally out in the ground. The rest of his con- 
 federates were there, quietly feeding on the remains of the 
 garden. Finally I found myself on the hot, high road, with 
 all my captives and one dog, in search of the pound. Not 
 knowing where the pound was, after driving them for a 
 quarter of a mile, I made inquiry of a respectable looking 
 man, whom I met in corduroy breeches, on the road. He 
 informed me that he did not know. I then fell in with a 
 colored boy who told me the only pound was at Dobb's 
 Ferry. Dobb's Ferry is a thriving village about seven miles 
 north of Nepperhan. I made a bargain with the colored boy 
 for three dollars, and by his assistance the animals were 
 safely lodged in the pound. By this means I was enabled 
 to return to my guest. Next day I found out the owner. I 
 got the fence-viewers to estimate the damages. 

The fence-viewers looked at the broken mahogany and 
 estimated. I spoke of the vases, the flowers, (greenhous 
 flowers) and the confectionery. These»did not appear to 
 strike them as damageable. I think the fence-viewers are 
 not liberal enough in their views. The damages done to a 
 man's temper and constitution, shall be included, if ever I 
 get to be fence-viewer; to say nothing of exotics trampled 
 under foot, and a beautiful dessert. ruthlessly destroyed by 
 unclean animals. Besides that, we shall not have a pea until 
 everybody else in the village has done with peas. We shall 
 be late in the season with our early peas. At last an adver- 
 tisement appeared in the county paper, which contained the 
 decision of the fence-viewers, to wit:

"Under the circumstances," said I, "Mrs. Sparrowgrass, 
 what do you think of the pound as a legal remedy." Mrs. 
 S. said it was shameful. "So I think, too; but why should 
 we repine? the birds sing, the sky is blue, the grass is green 
 side up, tho trees are full of leaves, the air is balmy, and the 
 children, God bless them ! are happy. Why should wo repine 
 about trifles ? If we want early peas we can buy them, and
