A buck of the latter weighed 212 pounds. There was a 
 very fine team of three pair of mules, admirably bi'oke 
 and managed, and some good horses ; but the display in 
 this department was quite short of what it should have 
 been. 

The fruit and vegetable departments were well repre- 
 sented in quality, but the horticultural exhibition of the 
 preceding week no doubt interfered to lessen the number 
 • , f contributors, who had already displayed there many 
 their choicest specimens. 

The swine were chiefly of the Chester county breed, 
 and of the best quality. These are generally preferred 
 by the farmers to either Suffolks or Berkshires, although 
 the latter have some warm advocates. 

Owing to the success of the two past exhibitions of 
 the Chester County Agricultural Society, they have con- 
 cluded to purchase a lot of ground, and erect permanent 
 accommodations for the future. 

Chester County Horticultural Society 
 Held its exhibition one week preceding that of the 
 Agricultural. The attendance was not so large as usual, 
 proving the expediency hereafter of holding both simul- 
 taneously, which last year proved a mutual advantage. 
 The display of fr»its was the best we have seen this 
 season, excepting at the exhibition of the Philadelphia 
 Horticultural Society. Chester county farmers are 
 wisely turning their efforts in this direction. Green- 
 house plants, flowers and vegetable productions, always 
 numerous and good at this society's exhibitions, fully 
 kept up their reputation this season, and the collections 
 contained many new specimens recently introduced. 
 Altogether the exhibition was a highly creditable one. 

Management of Orchards. 
 We hear general complaint of the decay of orchards 
 in this section of the State. Many trees appear to be 
 dying, or very unthrifty, even those not long planted. 
 Such as bear, produce defective, imperfect fruit, and 
 Borne farmers have even cut down their orchards, so as 
 to occupy the ground with crops, which they think will 
 pay better. Notwithstanding the above facts, which are 
 often brought to our notice, we still decidedly believe 
 that growing apples, pears, plums, cherries, raspberries, 
 strawberries, &c, is the most profitable use that can be 
 made of a large portion of our farms in sections conve- 
 nient to market. All that is wanting is to give our trees 
 the same attention we give our other crops. In ordinary 
 seasons no farmer would admit his inability to grow a 
 crop of corn, wheat, or potatoes. We say, study in the 
 Bame way the habits of trees, the conditions essential to 
 their health and productiveness, and it is as easy to 
 grow good apples and pears as good corn and potatoes. 
 Would a farmer expect a full crop of corn if he planted 
 and allowed to grow six or eight grains in a hill, and 
 never passed the cultivator through the rows to stir the 
 Boil and kill the weeds ? Would he look for a crop of 
 potatoes if he applied no manure, or dropped the sets 
 on top of the ground ? No ; he well knows such man- 
 agement, or want of management, would ensure failure. 
 Fruit trees, however, are supposed to have peculiar con- 
 stitutions, such as will thrive under neglect, and bear 
 regularly large, perfect and delicious specimens without 

any attention. In at least two-thirds of the instances, 
 they are in the first place not half planted, but crammed 
 into small holes in contact with cold, sterile unprepared 
 soil, destitute of the proper food they require. Then 
 again, as " ground is scarce, even on two and three hun- 
 dred acre farms, the young orchard must be cropped 
 with the regular rotation and laid down to grass, which 
 is allowed to grow up to the very trunks of the trees. 
 The stock are now and then turned into it, particularly 
 the sheep and calves, "it is so convenient." No pru- 
 ning is done in proper season, and in a proper manner, 
 for want of time. The bark is allowed to become hard, 
 mossy, and often covered with the bark louse ; the apple 
 borer, a curious little fellow, often unobserved, finds an 
 entrance, and lives in undisturbed security. The idea 
 of applying lime or manure, or that trees require a 
 regular supply of fertilising materials, is ridiculed as 
 wasteful. The very natural conclusion then follows, 
 that fruit growing will not pay. 

On recurring back to a period of twenty-five or fifty 
 years ago, when orchards were thrifty, and no difficulty 
 was found in growing fine fruit, we find many circum- 
 stances to have been more favorable than at present, or, 
 in other words, more care is required now than was then. 
 In those days there was no relentless war waged tgainst 
 the birds, and consequently insects of various kinds, 
 which prey on both fruit and trees, were not so destruc- 
 tive. In the beautiful economy of nature there is al- 
 ways true harmony, and destructive agencies or elements 
 are stayed or modified by counteracting influences. In 
 every thing is seen design. The carbonic acid in the at- 
 mosphere evolved by respiration, combustion and decay, 
 is necessary for the growth of plants, which absorb it, 
 retain the carbon, and give out oxygen into the atmos- 
 phere to reform carbonic acid. The circle is always 
 completed. Nothing is created in vain and nothing lost. 
 AVe believe the over-increase of insects, which often de- 
 feat the best efforts of the husbandman and orchardists, 
 was intended to be restrained by their being made the 
 food for birds, and that the destruction of the latter is 
 one very prominent reason for the depredations of the 
 former, and that the bad effects are especially observa- 
 ble in the difficulty of raising good fruit. We shall 
 speak of other reasons in future numbers, and also the 
 remedies, but have space but for this one at present. 
 Before the young men of the present day are fairly in 
 their teens, (there are no boys now,) they may be seen 
 with the gun on the shoulder waging in cruel sport an 
 indiscriminate warfare against the birds, both large and 
 small. Their education is not considered complete unless 
 they can kill a wren or torn tit at forty yards. To do 
 this is considered quite manly. As a reward for appli- 
 cation to business, rearing a fine calf, or special atten- 
 tion to some other department of the farm, they are 
 promised the height of their ambition, "a new gun, with 
 a double twist barrel, just from London," with which 
 they may be able to take a more deadly aim at the poor 
 birds. 

Seriously, we think parents and others, who have the 
 care of children, are bound to discourage, from a regard 
 to their own interests, this prevailing fondness for gun- 
 ning, which we are confident is one cause of the rapid 
 increase of insect enemies to fruit as well as ornamental
