[October 

trees, vegetables, and other productions, both of the 
 farm and garden. 

The grape vine now has its borer, ^e/eria, as well as 
 the alypia octomaculata, attacking and eating up the 
 leaves about midsummer, and a grape vine beetle, Hal- 
 tica, which destroys the fruit buds early in the spring. 
 Pear trees have the slug worms, Tomicus, which destroy 
 the leaves, the bark louse, and the Psy lla or jumping 
 louse, which punctures the bark of young shoots near 
 the buds, and lives by suction. Peach trees, the jEgcria 
 ".xitiosa or peach borer, and another insect, Tomicus 
 liminaris, which lives under the bark. Cherry trees have 
 their canker and slug worms, and weevil. Plums, the 
 curculio and slug worm, as well as other insect enemies 
 not yet known, and apple trees also their peculiar depre- 
 dators. All these appear to be largely on the iricrease, 
 and it is a matter of general interest how far it may be 
 attributed to the destruction of birds.

 G. Morris to the Boston Cultivator the subjoined list of 
 his fine stock lately arrived in Philadelphia per the Oli- 
 ver «, irdan :

 This calf was born on the voyage, and named after the 
 vessel. 

We also have brought out our young Duchess 71st, 
 the progeny of our celebrated cow Duchess 66th, (the 
 700 guinea cow). This heifer calf, as you may recollect, 
 we bred in England, and was got by Duke of Glo'ster. 
 We refused 700 guineas for her this spring, just before 
 shipping her for this country. 

American Herd Book. 
 The American Short-Horn Herd Book, of 650 pages, 
 by L. F. Allen, is just issued as we are going to press. 
 It contains 2700 full pedigrees and upwards of fifty 
 portraits. Price to subscribers $5 ; non-subscribers $6. 
 If sent by mail, 45 cents must be added to prepay postage. 

Culture of Cranberries. 
 Those of our readers intending to commence the cran- 
 berry culture are referred to our advertising pages for 
 plants. F. Trowbridge has had large experience in 
 their culture and sale. 

Raising Calves. 

The following method pursued in England for raising 
 calves, we copy from one of our English papers. Now, 
 that the raising of stock has become profitable in the 
 Atlantic States, the best and cheapest plan to keep them 
 in thriving condition from the start is a matter of some 
 importance, and perhaps the secret of profit. Young 
 animals should not be forced prematurely by high feed- 
 ing, nor, on the other hand, should they be allowed any 
 check by scanty food or want of shelter. The aim 
 should be to keep them in a thriving and growing condi- 
 tion. The daily use of the card or brush through the 
 winter and entire cleanliness will be found important: 

"Calves at a month old, by the first of April, have 
 proved to do well on half a pint of good oatmeal, or the 
 same quantity of linseed mixed in a little cold water, 
 and boiling water poured over it, making the half pint 
 of meal or linseed into two or three quarts of liquid. 
 This should be mixed twelve hours before given to the 
 calves, as it should stand this time, and the vessel being 
 covered it will be found then of sufficient warmth. Best 
 Scotch oatmeal is most economical, and is perhaps better 
 than linseed. It should be given at first with a small 
 quantity of milk, or the calves having been fed previ- 
 ously only on this will not readily take to this food ; to- 
 gether with this, hay and some roots are a good pre- 
 paration for their taking to grass. Six weeks of this 
 feeding will suffice, giving them the mixture only once a 
 day the last week, and lowering its quality, to wean 
 them from it ; and by this time they will take to grass 
 as their only and sufficient food, if good wholesome pas- 
 ture. Water should only be given very sparingly when 
 required from drought, and on no account should calves 
 at grass have unrestrained access to spring water. As 
 the nights get cold in October, they should have a small 
 quantity of hay, and the tops of carrots or early turnips 
 will now forward their growth until December, when a 
 regular supply of Swedes, with chaff of oat or barley 
 straw, will keep them in good growing condition until 
 the time for grazing, or they might be kept well through 
 the summer on chaff and a plentiful supply of mangold 
 wurzel until early turnips take its place. This treat- 
 ment should be repeated the second year, unless steers 
 are intended to be fattened at two years old ; therefore, 
 in October, at on£ year and a half, or at two years and 
 a half old, they should get chaff of good hay, with two 
 quarts of barley or other meal, either from oats, beans, 
 or tail wheat, or instead of meal three lbs. of oilcake, 
 with as many Swedes as they will consume given them 
 twice each day, with no water. Heifers should be kept 
 on similar treatment until the last winter before calving, 
 when roots are not needed, and can be given to greater 
 advantage to other stock, as a plentiful supply of straw, 
 and a little hay, for the last two months before calving, 
 is more healthy and likely to avoid risk from inflamma- 
 tion. At this time good hay, good water, which is very 
 essential, and good pasture, is the staple food for cows ■ 
 in milk and during the three months of winter, Decem- 
 ber, January, and February, during which time it is 
 usual they are dry before calving. The straw-yard, as 
 beforesaid for heifers, with a good supply, a stream of 
 water, shelter, and a little hay added a month before 
 calving, will keep cows in good condition."
