Prospective Prices of Produce. 

The farmers of the Great West have doubtless secured 
 the most bountiful crops of grain ever grown on their 
 prolific soil. Even supposing their Indian corn to be 
 shrunk one-fourth by excessive rain and early frost, the 
 year's product of food for man and beast will yet be 
 beyond example. After reserving generously for their 
 own wants, they will still have an immense surplus to 
 tell either directly as grain, or in the more concentrated 
 orm of beef and pork. And, as yet, there is a promise 
 cf a liberal reward for their toil. Every one must judge 
 for himself as to the policy of selling this fall or holding 
 over. Should the great war continue and extend, there 
 is a strong probability that the prices of next spring 
 will be at least as high as the present. And with such 
 prices there is no reason why the great majority of far- 
 mers should not make a profit on the year's operations 
 — reduce if not extinguish their debts, improve their 
 lands, increase their stock of cattle and their variety of 
 implements, and place themselves in position to grow a 
 still larger crop next yeas. 

Against one risk — that of selling for baseless promises 
 — it might seem needless to proffer caution ; yet we know 
 that thousands, undeterred by the sad experience of 
 others, will sell their grain or cattle for the notes of 
 speculators, if they can thereby secure a higher price 
 than would be paid in cash. But why should any sane 
 man do this ? Grain and meat are cash articles ; they 
 can be turned, by the help of our public works, inside 
 of sixty days at furthest ; and men who have any right 
 to credit can obtain money enough from good banks to 
 buy and send abroad produce. No buyer who ought to 
 be trusted will ask a farmer for credit, for he perfectly 
 understands the advantage of buying for cash. AVho- 
 ever asks a farmer to trust him for his grain or stock 
 until it can be sent to market and sold, thereby confesses 
 himself unfit for his business, and unworthy of credit. 
 There may be exceptions ; but the general rule is clear, 
 that whoever, in times like these, has any business to 
 buy produce at all, can get money of those who make a 
 business of lending it to better advantage than he can 
 buy on credit of those who need their pay. — New York

Pennsylvania Farm School. 

The Pennsylvania Farm School has been definitely 
 located by the Board of Trustees in Centre county, on 
 land donated for the purpose by General Irvin. We 
 had hoped ere this to have had the minutes of the meet- 
 ing for publication, with description of the property and 
 its advantages over other places in different sections, 
 also offered on favorable terms. The trustees have no 
 doubt acted for the best, and having before them all the 
 data for a correct decision, which the public as yet have 
 not, it is only fair to presume that the location in Centre 
 county under all the circumstances was the most de- 
 sirable. 

We think the farmers in this section of the State have 
 very unwisely allowed this opportunity to slip by them 
 The very liberal offer in our late number of $1000 was 
 not seconded, or met in a proper spirit, and till the pro- 
 gressive spirit of the times requires the establishment of 
 another Farm School in Pennsylvania, we shall be with- 

out many of the advantages which would have resulted 
 from its location here. This, however, is comparatively 
 a small matter — the main thing being to establish the 
 school under the right auspices, and somewhere in the 
 State, so as to be open to pupils from every section. 

The selection of Charles B. Trego as Principal of 
 the school, we think has been most fortunate. Having 
 had large experience as a teacher, filled a prominent 
 position in our legislature, being a practical farmer, 
 author, and of well acknowledged scientific reputation 
 and ability, the warmest wishes of the early friends of 
 the Farm School, we hope and believe, will be realized. 

We shall give the earliest information about the open- 
 ing of the school, which will probably be the coming 
 spring. 

Pumpkin Borer. 

Alexander Scott, an intelligent and enterprising 
 farmer of Delaware county, occupying the Haverford 
 school farm, "was recently showing us specimens of his 
 pumpkin vines, the centres of which had been entirely 
 eaten out by insects. His whole field was attacked in 
 this way, and the vines destroyed. The single one 
 handed us contained more than twenty of these little 
 borers. We have frequently known single cases of 
 squash and pumpkin vines thus attacked, but never be- 
 fore such wholesale destruction of an entire field. The 
 insect is the JEgeria cucurbitoe of Harris, and belongs 
 to the order Lepidoptera. Harris says of them, "Du- 
 ring the month of August, the squash and other cucur- 
 bitaceous vines are frequently found to die suddenly 
 down to the root. The cause of this premature death 
 is a little borer, which begins its operations near the 
 ground, perforates the stem and devours the interior. 
 It afterwards enters the soil, forms a cocoon of a gummy 
 substance covered with particles of earth, changes to a 
 chrysalis, and comes forth the next summer a winged 
 insect. This is conspicuous for its orange colored body, 
 spotted with black, and its hind legs fringed with long 
 orange colored and black hairs. The hind wings only 
 are transparent, and the fore wings expand from one 
 inch to one inch and a half. It deposits its eggs on the 
 vine close to the roots, and may be seen flying about the 
 plants from the 10th of July to the middle of August." 

We know of nothing in the way either of remedy or 
 prevention. 

Pedigree of St. Lawrence, Jr. 

The following pedigree of the fine young bull St. 
 Lawrence, Jr., purchased in Kentucky by T. H. Brin- 
 ton, of Delaware county, and now on his farm near 
 Chadd's Ford, was accidently omitted in a former 
 number : 

Calved September 15th, 1854, color roan. 1st dam 
 Dutchess was got by Value ;* 2d dam Ann Fish was got 
 by Jake ; 3d dam imported Lady Littleton was got by 
 Rammiculus (2179)/ E. H. B. ; 4th dam The Kicker in 
 England by Memmon (2294), E. H. B. ; 5th dam The 
 Kicker in England by Ratify (2431), E. H. B. ; 6th dam 
 The Kicker in England by Leighton's Logic (4248), E. 
 H. B. 

* Bull Value was got by 2d Locomotive (a very superior bull of Mr. 
 Bates' stock,) (42-12) K. H. B. His dam was the imported cow Claid.
