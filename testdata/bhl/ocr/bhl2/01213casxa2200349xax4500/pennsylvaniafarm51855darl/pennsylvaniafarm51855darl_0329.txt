(from the plan pursued by some people with an ox intended 
 to be shown at Sinithfield, in a class restricted from corn, 
 cake, pulse, &C, &C, which has the cream of several cows 
 given him by way of compensation, to that by the man who 
 endeavors to fatten his animals on turnips and barley straw,) 
 that it would take up far too much of the Society's valuable 
 journal even to enumerate them. I shall, therefore, simply 
 give the plan I recommend, leaving my readers to follow it 
 if they like, and improve upon it whenever they can." 

"I think in many instances stall feeding is not commenced 
 early enough in the autumn. As soon as the weather be- 
 comes damp, and the days shorten much, some say in Octo- 
 ber, the grass in my neighborhood loses its feeding properties, 
 and then the sooner your bullocks are put up the better. 
 For this purpose, I recommend having some of the large, 
 forward descriptions of turnips provided, perhaps the 'red 
 tankard,' although watery, and soon becoming of little value, 
 are at this early season the best of any, from their early ma- 
 turity; these are sown in April, at the rate of an acre to 
 every eight bullocks, which will last them three or four 
 weeks, according to the crop, and leave a light fold to begin 
 the sheep upon ; at the end of which time the forward 
 Swedes are ready to begin. During this period I give them 
 little or no oil-cake, if they are only in moderate condition, 
 but they have half a stone of pollard a day, mixed with an 
 equal quantity of hay or straw chaff. Some persons may 
 fancy this food is of too loosening a nature, but I can assure 
 them, from several years' experience, that although pollard 
 is loosening itself, yet it has the effect of preventing the 
 watery white turnip from purging too much. Although the 
 bullocks do not gain much in weight during this time, yet I 
 am satisfied they go on faster afterwards ,• the reason of 
 which is, I suspect, that their bodies are more prepared for 
 the artificial state they have to live in for the next few 
 months. 

Early in November the food must be changed to Swedes, 
 cake, &c, the quantities of each must vary according to cir- 
 cumstances ; the following I consider a good allowance where 
 Swedes are not scarce, if they are, more oil-cake must be 
 given instead of a part of them, or if very plentiful they may 
 be allowed even more. The morning's bait, one bushel of 
 Swedes, well cleaned from dirt and cut small, given a few at 
 a time — then, the refuse pieces being well cleaned and a dry 
 bait consisting of 2 lbs. of oil-cake, 3 lbs. of pollard and a 
 little hay chaff. While they are feeding, the manure and 
 wet litter must be well cleared away, and which may be on 
 the bullocks taken off, the floor swept clean, and plenty of 
 fresh litter put in ; then have every bullock well brushed 
 with what is called a dandy brush — being a brush made with 
 whalebone, for taking the rough dirt off of horses. (Let no 
 slovenly farmer fancy this to be a whim of mine; depend 
 upon it, the bullocks are kept in much better health and 
 greater comfort for it.) They must now be left quiet; they 
 will soon lie down and rest, and chew the cud till after din- 
 ner, when anothar bushel of Swedes is given as before, in 
 small quantities, followed by a similar dry bait of cake, pol- 
 lard and hay chaff, but with the addition of 3 lbs. of bean 
 meal — this is left with them at night. Be careful that the 
 shutters are opened or closed, according to the weather, so as 
 to maintain an even warm temperature — but not hot enough 
 to make them perspire, if it can be avoided. Be also careful 
 that the mangers are well cleaned out between every bait. 
 I have mine cleaned at the commencement of the season, 
 and as often afterwards as I think necessary, with scalding 
 water and the scrubbing brush." 

"After a month or so the cake may be increased, and if it 
 is thought more convenient, the Swedes may be changed for 
 nangold wurzel. Many persons object to using mangold 

until the spring; they certainly are more valuable than 
 Swedes in the spring, and, therefore, should always be used 
 last. Never change from mangold wurzel to Swedes, after 
 you have once begun them, or the bullocks will not go on so 
 fast ; but if, from having a bad crop of Swedes, or from any 
 other cause, you want to begin mangold early, you have only 
 to lay them exposed to the air for a week or two, to wither, 
 and they may be used as early in the season as is required." 

" It will be observed that cleanliness, warmth and quiet, 
 are the great points I insist upon, of course coupled with 
 good feeding; but very many tons of. oil-cake are annually 
 wasted because the comfort of the animals is not more 
 attended to. It will also be observed that I have introduced 
 a cheap article of food, which, I think, does the beasts more 
 good, in proportion to its cost, than anything I give them; 
 I allude to pollard, or miller's offal, as some call it. This I 
 generally purchase at £4 15s. a ton. I have used it exten- 
 sively for some years, and like it much. Some of my neigh- 
 bors are now following my example." 

"Before I conclude, I wish to give these recommendations 
 respecting selling the bullocks when fat : Do not determine 
 upon parting with them exactly at a given time ; but if a 
 butcher wants to buy a part of them, a few weeks before you 
 think they are ready calculate how they are paying for what 
 they have eaten — and, if you feel satisfied on that head, do 
 not run the hazard of getting a bad sale by refusing a good 
 offer, or perchance the opportunity may not return. Sell 
 them to butchers at home if you can. Always estimate the 
 weight and value of your bullocks the day before any one is 
 coming to buy them ; and, after letting the butcher handle 
 and examine them well, let them out into a yard for him to 
 see — they will always show better than when tied up." 

Ringbone in Horses. 

From a late article on this subject by Mr. Percival a dis- 
 tinguished Veterinary Surgeon, we learn that this affection, 
 for which there are so many "sure cures," arises from a 
 weakness of the pastern joint, and what is called ringbone is 
 a callus formed around it for its protection and support. If 
 we could succeed in removing this enlargement by the cross 
 incisions with a chisel, or by binding on live toads, or by 
 cutting out little bladders — which, bursa by the way, belong 
 there and have nothing to do with the ringbone — or by com- 
 pelling the horse to wear a bar of lead, to drive the bone 
 down through the hoof, we should do — Well, what? Why, 
 we should remove the splint with which nature supports the 
 weakened joint. 

In process of time this joint, too weak for its duties, is 
 mended by being made stiff, yet more or less of the tempo- 
 rary apparatus for its support always remains. So the 
 imperfect use of the foot that follows, is not duo to the bony 
 tumor, but is a consequence of the stiff joint. 

This disease is more likely to occur in colts of a peculiar 
 formation of foot and of weak constitution, and as both of 
 these matters are transmitted in breeding stock, ringbone is 
 a hereditary disease, and so horses or mares affected with it 
 should not be used for reproduction. The practice of Amer- 
 ican farmers of breeding from mares so heavy, spavined and 
 ringboned and otherwise diseased so as to be worthless for 
 any other purpose, will soon deteriorate the best imported 
 blood. Mr. Percival, on the causes of this affection says : 

"A coarse or half bred, fleshy or bony-legged horse with 
 short and upright pasterns, is the ordinary subject of this 
 disease ; and there exist satisfactory reasons why we should 
 expect him to be so. The pastern and coffin bones consti- 
 tute the nethermost part — the pedestals — of the column of 
 bones composing the limbs, and being so, they receive the 
 entire weight and force transmitted from above. The pas-
