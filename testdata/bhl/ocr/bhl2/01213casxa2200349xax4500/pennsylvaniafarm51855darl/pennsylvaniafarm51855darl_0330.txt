tern, being long and oblique in position, receives the super- 
 incumbent weight in such an indirect lino, that, bending 
 towards the ground with the fetlock, nothing like jar or con- 
 cussion follows. The very reverse of this, however, happens 
 every time the foot of a limb having a short, upright pastern, 
 comes to tho ground. In such, instead of the weight de- 
 scending obliquely upon the sessamoids, (two small bones at 
 the posterior and inferior part of the fetlock joint,) and the 
 fetlock bending therewith, it depends directly, or nearly so, 
 upon the pastern, making this bone entirely dependent on 
 'one beneath it — tho coronet — for counteracting concussion; 
 and should any thing occur to diminish this, or to throw 
 more weight on the bones beneath than they can counteract, 
 jar of the whole apparatus ensues; and an effort of nature 
 to strengthen the parts, by investing them with callus and 
 ossification, is likely to be the ultimate result. For we 
 would view ringbone, disease though it must assuredly be 
 called, as frequently , in young horses, a recourse of nature to 
 strengthen weak parts — the bones being unequal to the exer- 
 tions or efforts required of them." 

To the last sentence of this quotation we wish to call spe- 
 cial attention. It is worthy of being written in letters of 
 gold, as an exemplification of a grand general principle that 
 pervades all the works of animated nature. 

Most of the so-called diseases that horse and cattle doctors 
 amuse themselves by curing, are only symptoms — mere steps 
 by which nature is restoring or attempting to restore a dis- 
 eased part. Thus, a boil is nothing but an operation by 
 which a little piece of dead flesh, called the core, is separated 
 and expelled from the living flesh that surrounds it; a felon 
 is the opening of a passage through the thick tendonous 
 sheaths of the fingers, for a like purpose. Again we say, 
 disease is not a thing, it is & process. 

We have seen ringbones treated in many different ways, 
 yet with no more benefit than arises from the relief of inter- 
 nal inflammation by counter irritation. From what is stated 
 above, it follows that, if the animal be young, it should be 
 better fed ; should not be incited to any undue exertion ; 
 that an irritating liniment, or even a blister, should be ap- 
 plied to the foot for the relief of the joint, and that, aftor the 
 disease has existed for some time and the joint has become 
 Stiff, all treatment must prove unavailing, and it should be 
 let alone. — Am. Agriculturist. 

"Behind Time." 

A railroad train was rushing along at almost lightning 
 speed. A curve was just ahead, beyond which was a station 
 at which the cars usually passed each other. The conductor 
 was late — so late that the period during which the down 
 train was to wait had nearly elapsed — but he hoped yet to 
 pass the curve safely. Suddenly a locomotive dashed into 
 eight right ahead. In an instant there was a collision. A 
 shriek, a shock, and fifty souls wero in eternity. And all 
 because an engineer was behind time. 

A great battle was being fought Column after column 
 had been precipitated, for eight mortal hours, on the enemy 
 posted along the ridge of a hill. The summer sun was sink- 
 ing to the west, reinforcements for the obstinate defenders 
 were already in sight, it was necessary to carry the position 
 with one final charge, or everything would be lost. A pow- 
 erful corps had been summoned from across the country, and 
 if it came up in season all would yet be right. The great 
 conqueror, confident in its arrival, formed his reserve into an 
 attacking column, and led them down the hill. The whole 
 world knows the result. Grouchy failed to appear. The 
 imperial guard was beaten back. Waterloo was lost. Na- 
 poleon died a prisoner at St. Helena because one of his mar- 
 shals was behind time. 

A leading firm in commercial circles had long struggled 
 against bankruptcy. As it had enormous assets in Califor- 
 nia, it expected remittances by a certain day, and if the sums 
 promised arrived, its credit, its honor, and its future pros- 
 perity would be preserved. But, week after week elapsed 
 without bringing the gold. At last came the fatal day on 
 which the firm had bills maturing to an enormous amount. 
 The steamer was telegraphed at day-break — but it was 
 found, on inquiry, that she brought no funds ; and the house 
 failed. The next arrival brought nearly half a million to 
 the insolvents, but it was too late — they were ruined, be- 
 cause their agent, in remitting, had been behind time. 

It is continually so in life. The best laid plans, the most 
 important affairs, the fortune of individuals, the weal of na- 
 tions, honor, happiness, life itself, are daily sacrificed be- 
 cause somebody is " behind time." There are men who al- 
 ways fail in whatever they undertake, simply because they 
 are " behind time." Tho allies have lost nearly a year at 
 Sebastopol, because they delayed a superfluous day after the 
 battle of Alma, and come up too late for a coup de main, just 
 twenty four hours " behind time." Five minutes in a crisis 
 is worth years. It is but a little period, yet it has often 
 saved a fortune, or redeemed a people. If there is one vir- 
 tue that should be cultivated more than another, by him who 
 would succeed in life, it is punctuality ; if there is one error 
 that should be avoided, it is being behind time. 

Ashes and Plaster. 
 A subscriber says : — " I wish to know if there is anything 
 in the nature of ashes or plaster, that causes them to neu- 
 tralize each other, when used together? My neighbor says, 
 he knows it is so, and that I shall lose my money and my 
 labor." 

Remarks. — Plaster is sulphate of lime. In the state of 
 ground plaster, as generally used in this country, it consists 
 of 28 lbs. of lime to 40 lbs. of sulphuric acid, and 18 lbs. of 
 water. 

Ashes are made up largely of silicates, mostly insoluble. 
 They contain also carbonates of the alkalis, potash and soda, 
 and of the alkaline earths, lime and magnesia, together with 
 a little of various phosphates, a little sulphate of lime (plas- 
 ter), a little soluble silica, and small portions of free alkali. 

In answer to the above question, science would say, "No ; 
 the two cannot neutralize each other; no decomposition will 
 be effected by mingling them in the soil; and so far as the 
 free alkali of the ashes might tend to dissipate the ammonia 
 of the soil, the plaster would counteract that tendency, and 
 so the effect of mixing them would be beneficial rather than 
 otherwise." 

If we propound the same question to practical farmers, we 
 get contradictory answers. One says he gets good results 
 from both ashes and plaster applied separately, but not 
 equally good, if they are mixed. Another says, it is less 
 labor to apply them together, and the results are quite as 
 good. Both know that they are right; and the scientific 
 man would be apt to think that he knows that the last only 
 is right. We incline strongly to the opinion that ashes and 
 plaster may be used together with no injury to each other, 
 but with perhaps some little advantage over their separate 
 use ; though it must be confessed that there are strong testi- 
 monies to the contrary coming from practical farmers. 

Let the experiment be thoroughly tried. On part of a 
 field apply the ashes and plaster in the hill before planting. 
 On another part, the soil being the same and similarly 
 treated in other respects, let the ashes be applied in the hill 
 at planting, and the plaster be applied after the first hoeing. 
 If the ground were peculiarly warm, it might be well to try
