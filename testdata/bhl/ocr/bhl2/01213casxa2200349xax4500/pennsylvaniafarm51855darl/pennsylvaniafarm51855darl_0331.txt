a third portion by sowing the ashes broadcast, and applying 
 the plaster to the hill. Our expectation would be that little 
 or no difference would appear, except that where the ashes 
 were sown broadcast, the crop might not be quite as forward 
 early in the season, but later would quite equal the other. 

"We are the farthest possible from wishing that the practi- 
 cal farmer should bow to the opinions of any one. If ag- 
 ricultural writers and agricultural workers will maintain a 
 little wholesome watchfulness and a great deal of kindly re- 
 spect for each other, the best interests of agriculture will be 
 advanced. — Nash's Farmer. 

Nitrogen for Plants. 
 The experiments of M. Boussingault showed pretty clearly 
 that plants acquire nitrogen in some form from the air; but 
 they did not determine whether it was the atmospheric 
 nitrogen gas, or whether it was derived from the ammonia — 
 this blank, adds Professor Way, M. Ville endeavored to fill 
 up in our knowledge of the processes of vegetation. He em- 
 ployed hermetically closed glass cases, and in these he ope- 
 rated upon cress, lupines, rape, wheat, rye and Indian corn ; 
 the result of these carefully conducted experiments was that 
 the crops in most cases contained considerably more nitrogen 
 than that present in their seeds, and (as ammonia) in the air 
 supplied to them. He thus arrived at the conclusion that 
 plants assimilate the atmospheric nitrogen. In a subsequent 
 series of experiments, M. Ville adopted measures to deprive 
 the air, before entering the cases, of all the ammonia which 
 it contained, so that any gain in nitrogen of the produce over 
 that of the seeds could not be traced to the agency of am- 
 monia. The result was the same as before: the gain of 
 nitrogen was undoubted. The truth or otherwise of these 
 deeply interesting enquiries, however, need not divert us 
 from the important practical facts which they serve to illus- 
 trate; since, whichever way nitrogen is assimilated by 
 plants, the rapidity of that assimilation is, we are well as- 
 sured, promoted by the increased freedom with which the 
 atmospheric air circulates through the soil, and by the depth 
 to which it freely penetrates. — Mark Lane Express. 

The Boston Veterinary Institute. 
 The importance of an institution which should be able to 
 disseminate sound instruction on the subject of veterinary 
 medicine, and supply the community with a class of compe- 
 tent veterinary surgeons, will be at once acknowledged, when 
 it is remembered to how great a degree we are dependent 
 upon domesticated animals for our pleasure, our support and 
 our wealth. Like the human species, they are subject to a 
 very great variety of maladies which can only be efficiently 
 controlled or relieved by a thorough acquaintance with their 
 anatomy, physiology, pathology, and hygeine, and with the 
 remedies best adapted to the cure of their diseases. The 
 amount of ignorance which prevails, in this country at least, 
 upon the subject, is very great, and yet it is but little appre- 
 ciated even by those who are most likely to suffer from it 
 The most valuable animals, when sick, are frequently con- 
 fided to the care of horse-doctors and cattle-doctors who are 
 as ignorant of the principles of veterinary medicine as they 
 are rash and unskillful in its practice. With a few excep- 
 tions, this class of practitioners, with us, have had no regular 
 education to qualify them for the exercise of a profession 
 which requires in some respects more knowledge, as well as 
 a higher sagacity, than is called for in the treatment of the 
 human patient; for the physician is deprived of a most im- 
 portant source of information, both in the detection of symp- 
 toms, and in the effect of remedies, from the incapacity of 
 the sufferer to describe his own sensations. 

Incompetent, as too many of our veterinary surgeons are, 
 we believe that even in its depressed condition among us, 
 the profession yields a handsome return to those engaged in 
 its practice, and there is no doubt that surgeons, properly 
 qualified by a regular course of study at some institution of 
 known reputation, would find a rich field for the exercise of 
 their art in our community, where valuable animals are often 
 sacrificed, either in consequence of the ignorance of the doo- 
 tor, or from the skepticism of the owner, who in despair re- 
 fuses all medical interference. The profession has hithorto 
 been looked upon as rather beneath the notice of an educated 
 and cultivated man; though upon what grounds we are at a 
 loss to conceive. In order to become accomplished in it, 
 one must spend years in patient study, in attendance on lec- 
 tures and clinical instruction, and in dissection. He should 
 be familiar to some extent, at least, with all the different 
 branches which are required for the ordinary practitioner of 
 medicine and surgery ; and an acquaintance with those de- 
 partments of science which have no immediate bearing upon 
 veterinary medicine, will tend indirectly, by promoting hab- 
 its of observation and investigation, to qualify him for the 
 study and treatment of the maladies of the brute creation. 
 In England and France there are several schools for instruc- 
 tion in this branch of knowledge, which offer every advan- 
 tage that can be desired.' That at Alfort, near Paris, has 
 long been celebrated. It contains about three hundred stu- 
 dents, and the course of study, which exceeds through four 
 years, embraces lectures on anatomy, chemistry, botany, ma- 
 teria medica and pharmacy, veterinary surgery, with opera- 
 tions and the practice of medicine as applied to animals. 
 The use of the forge is also taught. 

We are glad to see that there is a prospect that this sub- 
 ject will receive among us that attention which it has so long 
 needed. In May last, an act of the Legislature was passed, 
 incorporating the " Boston Veterinary Institute," the object 
 of which is to afford ample instruction to persons desirous of 
 qualifying themselves for the practice of veterinary medicine 
 and surgery. The plan of instruction includes lectures on 
 the Anatomy and Physiology of the Horse, on Theory and 
 Practice of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery, and on Cattle 
 Pathology. Students will also bo allowed to attend the leo- 
 tures on Chemistry and Pathological Anatomy in the medi- 
 cal department of Harvard University, and Clinical Lectures 
 will be given by the Faculty. 

The officers of the Institute consist of the following gentle- 
 men:— D. D. Slade, M. D., President; George H. Dadd, Pro- 
 fessor of Anatomy and Physiology ; Charles M. Wood, Prof. 
 of Theory and Practice ; Robert Wood, Prof, of Cattle Pa- 
 thology. D. D. Slade, M. D., John W. Warren, M. D., 
 George Bartlett, M. D., and Charles Gordon, M. D., Board 
 of Examiners. 

We hope that this effort in behalf of a noble and useful 
 purpose, will meet with a corresponding encouragement from 
 the community. Without assistance at this early period of 
 its organization, the School will not be able to sustain itself. 
 All who own horses or stock, should contribute something 
 towards an enterprise which will be a benefit to them. It is 
 hoped that the next legislature will mako the Institution a 
 handsome grant. When money is so freely lavished on bo- 
 tanic colleges and female medical schools, it surely ought not 
 to be withheld from an object whose practical utility will, we 
 presume, be questioned by no one. — Medical and Surgical
