Baked Beets. 

A good housewife assures us that the mode of cooking 
 beets heroin described, is preferable to all others : — 

" Beet root cannot be too much recommended to the notiee 
 of mankind, as a cheap and salubrious substitute for the now 
 failing and diseased potato. Hitherto the red kind has been 
 only used in England as a pickle, or a garnish for salad ; even 
 the few who dress it, generally boil it, by which process the 
 rich saccharine juice is lost, and the root consequently ren- 
 dered less nutricious by the quantity of water it imbibes, as 
 well as by parting with the native syrup, of which it is thus 
 forcibly deprived; it is, therefore, strongly recommended to 
 bake instead of boiling them, when they will be found to 
 afford a delicious and wholesome food. This is not an un- 
 tried novelty, for both red and white beet root are exten- 
 sively used on the continent; in Italy, particularly, they are 
 carried about hot from the oven twice a day, and sold pub- 
 licly in the streets; thus they are purchased by all classes of 
 people, and give to thousands with bread, salt, pepper and 
 butter, a satisfactory meal. There are few purposes for 
 which baked, or even roasted or fried beet root, would not be 
 found preferable to boiled." — Ag. Exchange. 

Action of Lime. 

At a "Weekly Council of the Royal Agricultural Society, 
 Professor Way delivered before the members a lecture on the 
 result of a nine months' investigation into the condition un- 
 der which lime affects the absorbtive powers of soils in ref- 
 erence to ammonia. These results were numerically repre- 
 sented in a small table, containing only four vertical columns, 
 intersected by as many horizontal spaces; but would pi - ove, 
 as Professor Way remarked, of a permanent value, worth 
 all the time and labor bestowed upon their production, if 
 they should be found to lead to tho establishment of any new 
 principle in agriculture. His lecture was chiefly occupied 
 in the discussion of those results, and of the clue they might 
 possibly give to explanations of the mode in which lime acted 
 upon soils as a manure. The two principal facts ascertained 
 by these experiments appeared to be the following : 1. That 
 all clay soils, more or less, even beyond the depth of twenty 
 feet, are found to possess a certain quantity of ammonia, de- 
 rived, as Professor Way supposes from the fishy and vegeta- 
 ble matter of beds of lakes or rivers, no bed of clay whatever, 
 he thought, being entirely free from ammonia. 2. That the 
 addition of lime to a soil set free one-half the ammonia it 
 contained; thus acting, in the first instance, as a "stimu- 
 lant" to vegetation, but as an exhauster of the stock of am- 
 monia already in the soil or to be slowly derived from the 
 atmosphere, if applied in large quantities. The two princi- 
 pal recommendations were, — 1. That liming should take 
 place periodically at short intervals, not more than eight to 
 ten bushels per acre being used every year, or every two 
 years : lime would, under such circumstances, he thought, 
 be found to be one of the most useful adjuncts of the farm. 
 2. That lime when slaked and mixed with water, forming 
 what was known as "milk lime," should be added to tank- 
 water, and distributed by means of piping, as in the case of 
 Mr. Mechi's operations at Tiptree or Mr. Kennedy's at Myre 
 Mill. Professor Way, in the course of this lecture, entered 
 into most interesting details connected with the chemical 
 machinery of the double silicates in the soil, by which the 
 action of lime was regulated; and with the experiments he 

had instituted for showing, in strong comparative contrasts, 
 the results he had obtained. He also pointed out the great 
 importance of giving to land, by means of suitable cultiva- 
 tion, that condition under which it would best act as an ab- 
 sorbent of ammonia from the atmosphere. He has drawn up 
 a completo statement of these details, which will be submitted 
 in due course to the members. 

Staggers in Sheep. 
 Formerly I lost sheep by this disease, until by experiment 
 I discovered a remedy, which has not failed me for many 
 years, and I think it a safe as well as a sure remedy. About 
 twelve years since I found that a nice ewe of mine, which 
 had two fine lambs, was affected with this disease. She was 
 down by the fence, at the side of the pasture, and when she 
 endeavored to walk or run, would stagger and fall, and ap- 
 peared to be blind. I went to her, took my knife out, cut off 
 an ear close to the head, and to my surprise found the blood 
 did not start; not so much as one drop could I obtain. 
 Thinking my sheep as good as dead, I concluded to try ex- 
 periments upon her. I returned to my dwelling, and taking 
 a bottle of spirits of turpentine in my hand, went again to 
 the pasture. I had been absent perhaps an hour, but the 
 sheep had not moved from where I left her, and there was no 
 discharge of blood from the ear. I poured perhaps twenty 
 drops of turpentine into one ear; and after waiting a few 
 minutes, I turned her over and poured the same quantity 
 into the other. She soon began to shake her head, and a 
 stream of blood ran from her amputated ear. In an hour 
 she was apparently as well as ever. Since then I have used 
 the same remedy, without cutting off the ear, and have never 
 lost a sheep by the staggers. — Rural New Yorker. 

The Apple Borer. 

Last autumn, Mr. David Thomas, of Union Springs, New 
 York, came into possession of a young orchard of about a 
 dozen trees, each four or five inches in diameter. They had 
 been much neglected, and were so infested with borers that 
 he thinks not one of them would have survived a year with- 
 out prompt attention. The presence of the borer is indica- 
 ted by tho orange-colored, sawdust like excretions thrown 
 out from the holes near the surface of tho ground, and the 
 first thing was to find their entrance. This was in most 
 cases easily accomplished by scraping all tho pith thus 
 thrown out away from the bark, and where necessary remo- 
 ving tho earth away from the tree till the roots branch and 
 separate from each other. As soon as the holes are found a 
 flexible twig is thrust into it, worked up and down till it 
 reaches the grub, which is at once known by the peculiar 
 crush it occasions. A twig the eighth of an inch in diame- 
 ter, and four or five inches long, is commonly quite suffi- 
 cient. Sometimes the holes are larger and more tortuous, 
 so that it may become necessary to cut away a portion of 
 the bark to obtain access, in which case care is taken to cut 
 longitudinally or lengthwise with the tree, so as to occasion 
 as little injury as possible. It is necessary to pass round 
 several times during the season in these examinations, as 
 new holes will often become visible that were not at first 
 discovered. 

By this treatment all the trees we have mentioned have 
 been restored to a sound healthy condition, with the excep- 
 tion of one that was so far gone that it could not be re- 
 covered. 

When the trees are taken at an early period in the attack, 
 the removal and destruction of the insects are very easy, as 
 much so as that of tho peach grub, the borer not immediate- 
 ly cutting deep into the wood of the tree. 

No remedy by way of prevention has been found equal to
