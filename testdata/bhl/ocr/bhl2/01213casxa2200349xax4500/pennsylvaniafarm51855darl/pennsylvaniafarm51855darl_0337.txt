nolia, the bud scales are thick and downy ; and in the 
 horse chestnut and balsam poplar, they are covered ex- 
 ternally with a plentiful exudation of gummy resin and 
 thickly clothed internally with a woolly substance. By 
 this beautiful provision both wet and cold are effectually 
 excluded. 

On the approach of spring, the resinous exudation is 
 melted off by the heat of the sun, the leaf buds throw 
 off their scales, and the leaves which were at first all 
 crowded and closely packed together in the bud, become 
 separated from each other by the elongation of their axis 
 of growth, on the formation between them of internodes 
 or naked intervals of stem, much in the same manner as 
 the joints of a telescope are drawn out one after an- 
 other. 

Now it is the growth of the terminal bud which pro- 
 duces the elongation of the stem, whilst the development 
 of the axillary buds produce the branches. But as the 
 axillary buds necessarily follow the symmetrical arrange- 
 ment of the leaves about the stem, it follows that there 
 is a tendency to symmetry in the development of the 
 branches. If the leaves be opposite for example, the 
 branches will be opposite; if the leaves be alternate, the 
 branches will be alternate, and so on. We find, how- 
 ever, that this is not the case, that the branches develope 
 irregularly. The symmetry of their arrangement ap- 
 pears to be obscured and interfered with by the follow- 
 ing causes.

1. The non-development of some of 

& \?}{° I the Axillary Buds. — As the primary 

plant is onl'y called forth from seed by 
 certain conditions of heat, light and mois- 
 ture, favorable to its development, without 
 which it remains latent in the seed, so the 
 branches only protrude from axillary buds 
 when circumstances are favorable, other- 
 wise the buds remain latent on the stem, 
 and no branches proceed from them. 
 Now many of the buds in the axils of the 
 leaves do not grow, because their growth 
 is checked by the rapid growth of some 
 few leading buds, which monopolise all the 
 nutriment, leaving them only just sufficient 
 to carry them forward with the increasing 
 thickness of the stem, and to maintain their position on 
 its surface, where they remain ready for action in case 
 the growth of the buds is checked by untimely frost or 
 other causes. It is generally the inferior buds which 
 are thus kept in a rudimentary state of growth. The 
 light does not get access to them so freely as to the buds 
 towards the summit of the branches. The symmetrical 
 arrangement of the branches is also prevented. 

2. By the growth of adventitious or irregular 
 buds, that is to say of buds which develope into branches 
 in parts of the stem between the leaves, and not in their 

regular place in the axilla of the leaves. Sometimes, 
 owing to the growth of the leading buds, the growth of 
 some of the axillary buds is checked altogether. When 
 this is the case they sink beneath the surface of the 
 stem, and are buried beneath the succeeding layers of 
 wood ; but their vitality is not destroyed so long as they 
 remain at a certain depth in the stem, that is to say in 
 the alburnum or sap-wood. The trunks and branches of 
 trees, therefore, always contain an immense number of 
 these buried buds, and should some of the leading 
 branches be broken off by high winds, then the current 
 of sap which flowed to the dissevered branches goes to 
 the buried buds, and starts them from a state of passive 
 to one of active vitality. They now force their way 
 through the wood to the surface, although that wood is 
 the successive growth of years, breaking forth into 
 branches. All must be familiar with the sight of willows 
 and other trees, whose main branches have been acci- 
 dentally broken off, and whose trunks have nevertheless 
 been covered with young branches and shoots, the growth 
 of buds which have been buried in their wood and for 
 years dormant beneath their surface. 

The practical farmer will now be able to understand 
 the philosophy of pruning. When trees are trained 
 against walls and other supports, certain leading shoot3 
 are cut, in order that the supply of sap they were mo- 
 nopolising may flow to certain lateral and latent buds, 
 and cause their growth in the proper direction. 

From these facts it is plain that plants, although ex- 
 posed to frost and snow, and every storm that blows, are 
 far from being destitute of a power of escape. How 
 innumerable are the buds with which a tree is covered ? 
 How complete their protective apparatus against the 
 winter's cold ? We have seen that each bud which re- 
 mains in union with the parent tree, if not developed, 
 only awaits the destruction of its associates to enter the 
 breach, repair the injury, and continue by its growth 
 the battle of the living principle in the plant against 
 the hostile forces of nature. Endowed with such powers 
 of defence, a tree will grow and lift its majestic and 
 massive stem for centuries to the air and light of heaven, 
 and if, after thus long and bravely conflicting with na- 
 ture, it should be finally piostrated by the power of the 
 tempest, the reserved and buried buds of other years 
 shall issue forth a new phalanx of defence, and renew 
 successfully the struggle of the plant for life. 

Premium Corn Crops for 1856 
 To those desirous of raising large crops of corn next 
 season, we would say one important requisite is to have 
 a deep soil, and that the fall of the year is the proper 
 time for several reasons to make a beginning in this di- 
 rection. Excepting on light ground, we greatly prefer 
 fall to spring plowing. The teams are generally in bet- 
 ter order, and more able for hard work. There is more 
 leisure to plow carefully, and it greatly relieves the 
 press of spring business. There is besides a positive 
 advantage to the soil, particularly if heavy, or of a te- 
 nacious texture. The alternate freezing and thawing of 
 the upturned surface, has a tendency to destroy its ad- 
 hesiveness and make it more mellow ; it also absorbs by 
 exposure to atmospheric influences more freely the nu 
 tritive gasscs floating about, the ammonia of heavy rains
