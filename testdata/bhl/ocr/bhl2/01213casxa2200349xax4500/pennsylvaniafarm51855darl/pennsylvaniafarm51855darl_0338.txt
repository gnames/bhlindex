and deep snows, and is actually improved in quality. 
 Our advice is, use the Double Michigan Plow, let it go 
 down twelve inches, bring up the yellow clay from its 
 resting place of centuries, open it to the sun and air, 
 and our word for it the corn crop of 1856, under such 
 management, with other treatment as we shall take oc- 
 casion to recommend in the coming spring, will be a very 
 heavy and remunerating one. 

Seedling Plums. 

We have received from our friend Wilson Dennis, of 
 Bucks county, some specimens of a very fine seedling 
 plum, called the Richland plum, which from its superior 
 eating qualities, and his description of the tree, we 
 should suppose worthy of general cultivation. He says 
 its name is derived from the place where it originated, 
 that the tree is a strong grower and great bearer, fruit 
 seldom rots, is not subject to the black knots, and is 
 generally free from the attacks of the curculio. It has 
 been cultivated in his vicinity for about twenty years, 
 and is preferred for the above reasons to most of the 
 other varieties more generally known. 

He also sent us specimens of Cornell's Fancy, Town- 
 send, and Watermelon apples. The first is a Bucks 
 county seedling, not unknown to many of our readers, 
 and with the others are well worthy of cultivation. As 
 friend Dennis is a zealous cultivator of fine fruit him- 
 self, and desirous to disseminate good varieties, he offers 
 to furnish scions of any of the above to any of the rea- 
 ders of the Farm Journal who will address him at Ap- 
 plebachsville, Bucks county, and enclose a stamp. 

Pumpkins and Squashes. 

There is hardly any class of vegetables in which there 
 is so much confusion of names and varieties as pumpkins 
 and squashes. They are particularly liable to sport and 
 run into sub-varieties, and should consequently always 
 be planted apart where it is desirable to retain them 
 pure. 

Professor Harris, of Cambridge, Mass., has given to 
 these vegetables particular attention, and endeavored to 
 arrange them with some definite classification, so as to 
 more readily recognise the different species. 

Our readers will recollect his interesting essay on this 
 subject prepared for one of our former numbers. We 
 have been permitted to copy below the following extract 
 from a letter recently addressed by him to Dr. William 
 Darlington, of West Chester, the result of further in- 
 vestigation, and which we take pleasure in transferring 
 to our pages. He says : 

"Botanists do not seem to be aware of the extent to 
 which Cucurbila maxima varies (if such may be considered 
 varieties), or, in other words, of the great number of forms 
 pertaining to the group which is represented by the typi- 
 cal C. maxima. My recent importation of seeds of this 
 typical species and some of its varieties has enabled me 
 to compare the plants and their fruits in the growing 
 state with such as were known and cultivated here. I 
 find that all of them agree in having in common certain 
 important characters, which seem to me to be of that 
 fixed nature that pertain to species, ho». T much soever 
 they may differ otherwise, as to form, color, &c. Some 
 of these characters have been entirely overlooked by 

all botanists, and this must account for my former 
 doubts and scepticism, as to what was really the Cucur- 
 bit a maxima. 

"The typical Cucurhita maxima is an oblate spheroid, 
 depi-essed at the poles, with meridional furrows (ten in 
 number ordinarily), of a deep yellow color externally, 
 orange colored within, and very hollow when ripe, and 
 with about four double rows of seeds. The leaves cor- 
 date, entire, and obsoletely serrated. The limb of the 
 corolla revolute, and the base wide. This is about all 
 the botanists tell us of its specific characters. Add to 
 these that the fruit stem is nearly cylindrical, more or 
 less oblique, never deeply grooved or five angled, and 
 never truly clavated, even when dry ; and that the base 
 of the stile is persistent, and takes the form of a nipple 
 after the flower withers and falls off. It is astonishing 
 that botanists should have entirely overlooked or ne- 
 glected to describe the peculiarities of the fruit-stem 
 and persistent stile. Moreover the seeds would never 
 be mistaken for those of any other cucurbita by any 
 careful observer, who had compared them with the seeds 
 of those pumpkins and squashes which have clavated, 
 angular, and furrowed fruit-stems. 

There are at least twelve different kinds as to form 
 and color, agreeing in the essential characters above 
 noted, which are known to me, and which are to be re- 
 ferred to the group of which C. Maxima is the type. 
 Some of these assume forms that are found in the group 
 represented by C. pepo, but can always easily be dis- 
 tinguished therefrom by the characters, already speci- 
 fied, derived from the fruit-stem, stile, leaves, corolla, 
 and seeds. Some of these kinds are vastly superior to 
 all other pumpkins and squashes as articles of food ; 
 such are those called the "Autumnal Marrow" (a pre- 
 cocious and small variety of the Valparaiso pumpkin or 
 squash), and the "Turban" or "Acorn squash," Cucur- 
 bita piliformis, Duchesne. 

"The Lima cocoa-nut squash (pumpkin), the white 
 bell cashaw,* and the striped cashaw or bell squash 
 (pumpkin), both differing specifically from the common 
 bell and crook-necked squashes of the Eastern States, 
 are also very superior kinds, and would probably suc- 
 ceed admirably in the Middle and Southern States. 

"The term pumpkin is somewhat indefinite, and is 
 variously applied. In the Eastern States, this name is 
 given almost exclusively to the roundish or spheroidal 
 fruits, of a yellow or orange color, depressed at the 
 poles, and having a clavated, deeply furrowed, and five 
 ribbed fruit-stem. This belongs to the Linnaean species 
 C. pepo, representing a group with many varieties as to 
 form, color, &c, which might for distinction be termed 
 Pepous — while to those in the other group, with a cylin- 
 drical fruit-stem, we might apply the name of Polirons." 

To Preserve Sweet Potatoes. 

As there is often very great difficulty in keeping sweet 
 potatoes through the winter, it may be well to remind 
 our readers of the precautions positively necessary to be 
 obsei'ved at this season in storing them away. Like 
 many other matters, there is no difficulty when the sub- 
 ject is well understood.
