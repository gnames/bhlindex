hurt by frosts before digging. They should be handled 
 carefully, placed in the barrels without rubbing the skins 
 or bruising, the barrels should not be rolled about but 
 placed on their ends, and finally should be kept in a dry, 
 warm room where there is not the least danger of frost. 
 A regular and even temperature of sixty-five to seventy- 
 five degrees, which, of course, in cold weather, implies 
 artificial heat, is required- By observing these precau- 
 tions, we have not found it necessary to, pack in the bar- 
 rels sand, shavings, or any other substance. The bar- 
 rels should be taken out to the potatoe patch, and the 
 potatoes put immediately in as they are dug. This at 
 least is our plan. The sand or dirt, which adheres to 
 them, is some protection to their very thin and tender 
 skins, and we would also advise not to rub off the small 
 fibres, but to deposit them in the bai'rel with the least 
 possible disturbance. _ It is a general practice for Jersey 
 farmers, previous to bringing their sweet potatoes to 
 market, to rub them off with a brush to make the skins 
 look clean ard smooth. This is an attraction to purcha- 
 sers, but very undesirable if the intention is to keep 
 them through the winter. In respect to varieties, it is 
 the opinion of many that the kind of sweet potatoes 
 which grow very long are not such good keepers as the 
 shorter and thicker ones. This shape does not seem to 
 be the effect of cultivation so much as some difference in 
 the variety, at least this is the opinion of Jersey farmers 
 with whom we have conversed.

 Keeping Sweet Potatoes. 
 As the time is now at hand for laying in our winter 
 Bupply of this excellent vegetable, allow me through 
 your columns to give my experience with regard to their 
 preservation. See that they are gathered when the 
 weather and soil are dry, and having picked them with 
 great care that none should get bruised, or any of the 
 fibrous roots rubbed off, lay them for three or four days 
 on a floor in some dry and airy exposure. Then procure 
 some old flour barrels, and if the staves fit very closely, 
 bore some inch holes, say twelve or fifteen in each bar- 
 rel, that there may be a free circulation of air. Put 
 some very dry shavings or leaves in the bottom, and 
 having wrapped each potatoe separately in paper, place 
 them carefully in the barrels one by one, and then store 
 them in a room of a nearly uniform temperature of about 
 50°. Don't head the barrels up, but cover them with a 
 ljose board or piece of carpet. The above plan we have 
 adopted now for several years with great success.

Ultimate Benefits of Droughts and the Modes in which 
 they act to improve Land. 
 It may be a consolation to those who have felt the in- 
 fluence of the late long and protracted dry weather, to 
 know that droughts are one of the natural causes to re- 
 store the constituents of crops, and renovate cultivated 
 soils. The diminution of the mineral matter of cultiva- 
 ted soils takes place from two causes : — 

1. The quantity of mineral matter carried off in crops 
 and not returned to the soil in manure. 

2. The mineral matter carried off by rain-water to the 
 sea, by means of fresh water streams. 

These two causes, always in operation, and counter- 
 acted by nothing, would in time render the earth a bar- 
 ren waste, in which no verdure would quicken, and no 
 solitary plant take root. A rational system of agricul- 
 ture would obviate the first cause of sterility, by always 
 restoring to the soil an equivalent for that which is taken 
 off by the crops ; but as this is not done in all cases, 
 Providence has provided a way of its own to counteract 
 the thriftlessness of man by instituting droughts at pro- 
 per periods, to bring up from the deep parts of the 
 earth food, on which plants might feed when rains should 
 again fall. The manner in which droughts exercise their 
 beneficial influence is as follows : — 

During dry weather a continual evaporation of water 
 takes place from the surface of the earth, which is not 
 supplied by any from the clouds. The evaporation from 
 the surface creates vacuum (so far as water is concerned) 
 which is at once filled by the water rising up from the 
 subsoil of the land ; the water from the subsoil is re- 
 placed from the next strata below, and in this manner 
 the circulation of water in the earth is the reverse to 
 that which takes place in wet weather. This progress 
 to the surface of the water in the earth manifests itself 
 strikingly in the drying up of springs, and of rivers and 
 streams which are supported by springs. It is not, 
 however, only the water which is brought to the surface 
 of the earth, but also all that which the water holds in 
 solution. These substances are salts of lime and mag- 
 nesia of potash and soda, and indeed whatever the sub- 
 soil or deep strata of the earth may contain. 

The water on reaching the surface of the soil is eva- 
 porated, and leaves behind the mineral salts, which I will 
 here enumerate, viz : Lime, as air-slacked lime ; magne- 
 sia, as air-slacked magnesia; phosphate of lime, or bone 
 earth ; sulphate of lime, or plaster of Paris ; carbonate 
 of potash, and soda, with silicate of potash and soda, 
 and also chloride of sodium or common salt: all indis- 
 pensable to the growth and production of plants which 
 are used for food. Pure rain-water, as it falls, would 
 dissolve but a very small proportion of some of these 
 substances, but when it becomes soaked into the earth, 
 it there becomes strongly imbued with carbonic acid 
 from the decomposition of vegetable matter in the soil, 
 and thus acquires the property of readily dissolving 
 minerals on which before it could have very little in- 
 fluence. 

I was first led to the consideration of the above sub- 
 jects by finding on re-examination of a soil which I 
 analyzed three or four years ago, a larger quantity of a 
 particular mineral substance than I at first found. As 
 none had been applied in the meantime, the thing was 
 difficult of explanation, until I remembered the late 
 long and protracted drought. I then also remembered 
 that in Zacatecas, and several other provinces of South 
 America, soda was obtained from the bottom of ponds, 
 which were dried in the dry, and again filled up in the 
 rainy season. As the above explanation depended on 
 the principles of natural philosophy, I at once instituted 
 several experiments to prove its truth. 

Into a glass cylinder was placed a small quantity of 
 chloride of barium, in solution; this was then filled with 
 a dry soil, and for a long time exposed to the direct rays 
 of the sun on the surface. The soil on the surface of
