the cylinder was now treated with sulphuric acid, and 
 gave a copious precipitate of sulphate of baryta. 

The experiment was varied by substituting chloride of 
 lime, sulphate of soda, and carbonate of potash, for the 
 chloride of barium, and on the proper re-agents being 
 applied in every instance, the presence of those sub- 
 stances was detected in large quantities on the surface 
 of the soil in the cylinder. 

Here, then, was proof positive and direct, by plain 
 experiments in chemistry and natural philosophy, of the 
 agency, the ultimate, beneficial agency, of droughts. 

We see, therefore, in this, that even those things 
 which we look upon as evils, by Providence are made 
 blessings in disguise, and that we should not murmur 
 even when dry seasons afflict us, for they too are for our 
 good. The early and the latter rain may produce at once 
 abundant crops, but dry weather is also a beneficial dis- 
 pensation of Providence in bringing to the surface food 
 for future crops, which otherwise would be forever use- 
 less. Seasonable weather is good for the present, but 
 droughts renew the store-houses of plants in the soil, 
 and furbish an abundant supply of nutriment for future 
 crops. ' JAMES HIGGINS,

Strawberry Culture. 

The following directions about the culture of straw- 
 berries, we copy from "Pardee on the Strawberry," a 
 work which should be in the hands of every cultivator 
 of this delicious fruit : 

Situation. — A warm, exposed, and yet rather moist 
 location is the best for a strawberry plantation. 

If very early fruit be an object, select a side-hill 
 gently sloping towards the south, with a liberal admix- 
 ture of small stones or coarse gravel in the soil. This 
 should then be protected on the north, west and east by 
 a high closed board fence, or a live hedge; we have seen 
 an artificial hedge of withered evergreen boughs that 
 answered an excellent purpose, and enabled the owner 
 to realize fifty cents per quart for the crop, when other- 
 wise he could not have so much anticipated the usual 
 season, and would have been compelled to take twelve 
 and a half cents for the same quantity. 

If late fruit be desired, then select a piece of land 
 facing the north, and exposed. Low land is usually 
 preferable to high, hilly land for the strawberry, yet it 
 can easily be raised on both ; a little knowledge of its 
 character will enable us to remedy the defects of the 
 high ground. If the situation is near a spring of water, 
 where it can be irrigated, and is also susceptible of 
 drainage, it is very desirable. 

Though they will sometimes succeed when partially 
 shaded with trees or shrubbery, yet they are best flavor- 
 ed in an open garden, with no shade but their leaves. 
 Alpines, and some other kinds, planted in the northern 
 shade of a fence or dwelling, will commence later and 
 continue longer in their bearing season. 

Selection of Soil. — New land, recently disrobed of 
 its forests, if of a deep gravelly loam, we think is the 
 best adapted to the strawberry, and next, a sandy loam ; 
 but almost any soil, even the heaviest clay, can be pre 
 pared, by a liberal admixture of sand or gravel, so as to 
 produce the finest fruit. 

As has been intimated, as low moist soil as can be 
 procured, consistently with depth and thorough drain- 
 age, is best adapted to the strawberry ; and yet elevated 
 knolls, and even sand-hills, with the precautions above 
 named, have often succeeded well. 

Wet, spongy lands, except with a porous subsoil sus- 
 ceptible of drainage; and high, barren hills, with a thin, 
 flinty soil, are alike to be avoided. 

The strawberry, however, is so retentive of life, that 
 it will live in almost any soil ; but it will not produce 
 much fruit, unless the remedies are in some way applied 
 to the ungeuial soils. 

Preparation of the Soil. — Clear the ground of 
 weeds, roots, and seeds of all kinds in preparation for 
 thorough drainage, which in most soils should be attend- 
 ed to the first thing. The best drains are the earthen 
 tile drains, from two to four rods apart, which should 
 be so constructed as to be left open at both ends for the 
 circulation of the air, as well as the release of stagnant 
 water. A brush or coarse stone drain is beneficial as a 
 temporary expedient. 

After draining, break up the soil as deep as possible 
 with a subsoil plough, or by trenching twenty inches or 
 more deep. The strawberry is so sensitive to drought 
 and stagnant water, that very little of the best land in 
 our country can be exempt from draining and trenching, 
 if we would receive in return uniformly large crops of 
 fruit in all seasons. 

Inasmuch as the fruit is composed of so large a pro- 
 portion of potash, soda, and lime — sixty-two parts in 
 every hundred — we recommend next, that an application 
 to the acre be made of twenty to thirty bushels of un- 
 leached or leached ashes, ten to twelve bushels of lime 
 — either stone or oystershell — with two to three bushels 
 of salt, which should be thoroughly mixed with the soil, 
 if possible, some weeks before the plants are set out. 
 A liberal handling of the soil, thoroughly pulverizing it, 
 before proceeding to the work of transplanting, is good 
 economy. 

Manures. — On this point we are aware we shall differ 
 widely from some of our ablest horticulturists, to whom 
 we confess our inferiority in most things in the great 
 science of horticulture ; yet, in this we are confident 
 that their own personal experiments, did their time per- 
 mit, would lead them to the same results that we have 
 deliberately arrived at. 

And first, we would not use animal or barn-yard ma- 
 nures for the strawberry. We have eschewed their use 
 entirely for the last six years. If friends, who have 
 watched our beds for years, say the soil was peculiar, 
 and is not a fair test, we answer, that may be, but we 
 have arrived at this positive conclusion from our experi- 
 ments and observation in other locations and soils, as 
 well as in our own garden, and every step has only con- 
 firmed us in the opinion, that animal manures are too 
 stimulating and exciting to the plant for the full bearing 
 properties of the strawberry. 

Fine fruit has been raised, we know, in fair quantities 
 and of enormous size, in the use of animal manures, y t 
 we think the quantity and quality would have been de- 
 cidedly increased by the use of vegetable instead of ani- 
 mal manures. The latter causes the plant to run too 
 much to vines, and start its runners before it has even
