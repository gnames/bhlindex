perfected the earliest part of the first crop of fruit, be- 
 sides filling the earth generally with seeds, and undecay- 
 ed portions of the straw, and fibrous portions from the 
 barn-yard, which come into injurious contact with the 
 numerous roots of the plant in its progress in the earth, 
 which should always be kept as pure for the strawberry 
 as possible. 

Leaf-mould, decomposed turf or peat, well composted 
 with new surface soil, or muck, ashes and lime, is a good 
 nanure for the strawberry. We wish it, however, dis- 
 ■inctly understood, that few good soils need enriching at 
 all for the strawberry ; on the contrary, most of the 
 soils (for instance, those in Western New York) would 
 be more benefitted by being depleted by an admixture of 
 half river-sand. 

It is far better to feed the fruit properties instead of 
 the plant; for we opine it will be found that the over- 
 feeding of the strawberry is one of the most universal 
 and destructive errors in its cultivation. 

Some use liquid manures, composed of cow and hen 
 droppings dissolved in a barrel of water ; but they are 
 not well adapted to assist the fruit bearing properties of 
 the plant, but are good if the object be to send out run- 
 ners and increase the plants. 

On the opening of spring — the latter part of April or 
 the 1st of May, in the latitude of the State of New York 
 — it is well to give the plants an impetus, by liberally 
 showering them every ten days or two weeks with a so- 
 lution, in six gallons of water, of one quarter of a pound 
 each of sulphate of potash, sulphate of soda, (Glauber 
 salts,) and nitrate of soda, with one and a half ounces of 
 sulphate of ammonia; or, if these cannot be conveniently 
 obtained, use the same quantity of potash, sal soda, 
 Glauber salts, and sal or muriate of ammonia ; or a so- 
 lution of either of them is beneficial if applied alone. 

We have tried for many years various combinations in 
 solution, but have been unable to obtain any so valuable 
 as the first named. 

We have always found plaster injurious to the straw- 
 berry, and ashes beneficial, when judiciously applied. 

Transplanting. — This is a process to which the straw- 
 berry is sensitive. The plant will live under almost any 
 treatment or any manner or mode of transplanting, but 
 will not always yield a full supply of good fruit unless 
 this process is appropriately performed. First we speak 
 as to TIME. 

For large plantations, or for ordinary cultivators, the 
 spring is perhaps the best season ; certainly it is the 
 time when it can be the easiest and most successfully 
 accomplished. The ground is soft and moist at that 
 time, and the weather is usually favorable. 

The next season generally recommended is the month 
 of September. Plants can then be easily obtained, and 
 after the cool, moist fall weather has commenced, the 
 ground works easily, and there is not much difficulty in 
 making them live. There is one danger, however, to be 
 especially guarded against in fall transplanting; that is, 
 the plants may not get so firmly rooted as to be enabled 
 to withstand successfully the severe frosts of winter. A 
 liberal covering of straw will assist in remedying this 
 matter. An advantage gained over spring transplanting 
 will be, the earth will not be ns liable to pack so very 
 hard around the plants in the fall, as under the hot 

summer's sun and rains, and the plants will not be so 
 likely to be checked in their growth as in the droughts 
 which often occur in June and July or August. 

We have transplanted strawberry plants successfully 
 for years, every month, from March until the 20th of 
 October, without difficulty. With mulching, shade, and 
 water, judiciously applied, it can be well done at any 
 time. Eor our ordinary planting, we prefer the 1st of 
 July for several reasons. The ground, if thoroughly 
 prepared then, will not be subject to become so hard 
 packed. The weeds will not be so troublesome. If the 
 plants get well started, and are not checked in their 
 growth, they will produce very nearly a full crop of fruit 
 the following spring. We have found that these advan- 
 tages will amply repay the little extra care in mulching, 
 shading, and watering. Ten or fifteen days' later plant- 
 ing will seriously lessen the first crop, according to our 
 observation. In spring planting, March will answer 
 south of Philadelphia, and last of April and first of May 
 for the north. 

Manner of Transplanting. — The best way undoubt- 
 edly is, to take the first runners as soon as fairly set, 
 and remove them with a transplanting-trowel, with the 
 roots and earth undisturbed. This cannot be conve- 
 niently done, except the plants are in the same garden 
 with the new bed. Neither have we ever found the first 
 runners more productive than the subsequent ones, un- 
 less they are stronger. 

In most cases, plants come from a distance, and great 
 care should be taken to get as large a proportion of the 
 numerous fibrous roots as possible ; and in order to do 
 this, the ground should always be well saturated with 
 water, either artificially or otherwise, before the plants 
 are taken up, and then the first thing to be done, is to 
 mud the roots, by dipping them in a little mud-hole 
 made in the garden soil, where the water has been pour- 
 ed and stirred, until it has become sufficiently thickened 
 with the soil to leave a good coating of mud on the roots 
 of the plants as they are withdrawn. This greatly pro- 
 tects the plants on a short or a longer transportation. 

For transplanting, the earth should be levelled and 
 made as flat as possible. If raised into beds or hills, it 
 will invite the drought, to which the strawberry plant 
 has a decided aversion. The plants should then be set 
 out, leaving the roots in as nearly their natural spread- 
 ing condition as possible ; with the fingers press the 
 pure earth compactly around the body of the plant, be- 
 ing careful not to set the plant too deep. If there is 
 any old bark or decayed portion of the leaves on the 
 plant, remove it before setting out : an old plant will 
 usually renew itself by sending out a new set of roots on 
 being transplanted, and it should be remembered that 
 the strawberry plant, while it places its roots, mainly, 
 near the surface of the ground, yet a portion of its 
 larger roots penetrate favorable soils to the depth of 
 from two to four feet, and even a greater depth in some 
 cases. 

Distance in Transplanting. — The Alpines and small- 
 er varieties should always be eight inches apart, while 
 the larger varieties should be allowed twelve to eighteen 
 inches. Put one plant in a place, and let no other re- 
 main nearer than the above distances, and it is not ma- 
 terial to success in cultivation whether you plant in
