The display of Devon stock was not at all extensive, nor 
 was that on exhibition of a very superior character, with the 
 exception of Mr. Lauuian's cow. First premiums have been 
 awarded by your Committee in several instances where they 
 could not consider the stock entitled to such a distinction, 
 but as there was no great degree of competition, there was 
 no discretion on the premises, but to award the first to the 
 best which were presented. 

All of which is rospoctfully solicited.
