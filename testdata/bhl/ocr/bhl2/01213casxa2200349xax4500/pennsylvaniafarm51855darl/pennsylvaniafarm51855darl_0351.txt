No. 16 â€” Poultry. 
 The Committee on Poultry, after a very thorough and 
 minute examination of the lorge stock on exhibition, submit 
 the following: 

It has seldom been our privilege to witness so fine a show 
 in this department. While a few of the specimens were 
 comparatively worthless and unfit for exhibition, the large 
 majority were of great excellence, and some of them truly 
 remarkable. The stock exhibited by Dr. Crabb, Messrs. 
 Gillespie, of West'Philadelphia, Smith, Dorwart and others, 
 were in condition to do them great credit as skilful and 
 attentive breeders. Other birds of equal purity of blood 
 seemed to be lacking in this respect, probably owing to want 
 of range, or assiduous care on the part of the owners. We 
 would earnestly enjoin upon exhibitors the necessity of 
 presenting their fowls in cleanly and healthful condition at 
 future shows. We have modified, to some extent, the pre- 
 mium list of the Society to suit circumstances. There were 
 many beautiful varieties not enumerated, to omit mention of 
 which would be unjust to the enterprising exhibitors.
