No. 17 — Plows and Plowing Match. 
 To James Gowen, President : — The Committee on Plows 
 and Plowing, having performed the duties assigned them, 
 beg leave to report — That the Committee were very much 
 gratified with the numbers and excellent qualities of the 
 plows exhibited. Especially the double Michigan Plow, 
 they think is entitled to special notice for its thorough 
 pulverizing qualities, and we believe it to be an implement 
 that every farmer ought to be in possession of; and we award 
 for it a silver medal to Henry Gilbert, the contributor. We 
 would notice also J. S. Hall's steel plow, a new article that 
 we think will very soon come into general use on account of 
 it3 superior merits ; we would therefore recommend a special 
 premium of a bronze medal to J. S. Hall for it.

The Committee in conclusion would say that they were 
 much gratified with the number of fine plows, plowmen and 
 teams that cotnpoted, and particularly with the decorum and 
 good order which provailed during the whole trial. Every 
 plowman gave evidence of thorough skill in the use of this 
 important implement, and so close was the competition, that 
 it was with difficulty the Committee were enabled to decide 
 between them in the awarding of premiums. As a whole, 
 the match was entirely satisfactory, both to the immense 
 crowd in attendance, and to the Committee.
