To same, for the best bridle leather, a diploma. 

It is due to Mr. Greenawalt to add, that he exhibited spe- 
 cimens of several other kinds of leather which do him much 
 credit as a manufacturer. 

Lacey & Philips, of Philadelphia — Those gentlemen ex- 
 hibit a very superior and splendid lot of carriage harness, 
 buggy harness, and men and women's saddles, for each of 
 which, in the judgment of the committee, they would be en- 
 titled to a diploma, but in consideration of the extent, vari- 
 ety, and superior finish and workmanship of the articles, 
 highly creditable to the exhibition, as well as to the contrib- 
 utors, the committee would respectfully recommend that, if 
 not inconsistent with the rules and regulations of the society, 
 there should be awarded to Lacey & Philips, for carriage 
 harness, buggy harness, and men and women's saddles, ex- 
 hibited by them, a silver medal. 

The committoe were highly pleased to find that in the ar- 
 ticle of leather, and articles manufactured of leather, there 
 was a spirited competition, and specimens of various kinds 
 not enumerated in the premium list were exhibited, and in 
 some, the difference in quality was so slight as to render it 
 very difficult to decide which was justly entitled to the pref- 
 erence. The committee anxious to do justice to all parties 
 concerned, have carefully considered the merits of each of 
 the articles brought under their notice, and, as the conclu- 
 sion to which their deliberations led them, respectfully sub- 
 mit this report. P. McIntyre,

No. 22. — Dairy, Sugar and Honey. 

To James Gowen, Esq., President : — The committee on 
 dairy products, honey and sugar, report that the exhibition 
 was not so large as desirable for so important a branch of 
 agriculture. The probable annual valuo of the dairy pro- 
 ducts of the State is about eight millions of dollars, and is 
 constantly increasing. The prices of buttor and cheese have 
 nearly doubled within the last five years and are now so high 
 as to increase the importance of these indispensable articles. 
 In some of our cities within a year, fine fresh butter has been 
 sold at forty and more cents per pound, and a very short 
 supply of the article at that or any price. In some large 
 towns in the months of February and March, no good butter 
 is to be had. It is believed however, that the time is not 
 far distant, when from all parts of the State, there will be 
 such a demand for pure sweet buttor, that the art of preser- 
 vation will be studied more, and supplies of butter be ob- 
 tained in the proper season which will rotain their fragrance 
 through tho year. This subject demands the attention of 
 all who keep dairies either for home consumption or for the 
 market. 

The committee therefore recommend this subject to the 
 earnest consideration of all dairymen, and hopo that at the 
 next Fair we may have an exhibition of .butter of a year old 
 and more, which still retains its freshnoss and fragrance. 
 Butter is put up for tho Navy and for the foreign merchant 

service which remain good for years, and such ought to bo 
 exhibited at our Fairs. 

The committee award the premiums as follows : 
 To Job Hayes, of Chester co., for the best lot of 10 pounds 
 of butter, parcel of that made fromfivo cows in thirty 
 days — whole quanty 173 pounds, a silver cream pot. 
 To W. Jessup, for second best do. for twenty days, from 

five cows, 108 pounds, a silver cup. 

To Sarah J. Logan, of Chester Co., for tho best 20 pounds 

of butter made in Juno, a silver goblet. 

To Mrs. Jacob Decher, Susquehanna co., for the best 10 

pounds butter made at .any time, a silver goblet. 

To Sarah J. Logan, of Chester co., for second best, do. 

a silver cup. 
 To Jacob M. Docker, Susquehanna co., for best firkin of 

butter, a silver goblet. 

To Miss Hannah Mary Hayes, of Chester co., for best lot 
 of butter made by girls under twenty-one years cf 
 age, a silver goblet. 

This last lot of butter was elegantly made, and does 
 great credit to Miss Hays' skill and neatness. It was 
 not only delightful to the taste but the eye was also de- 
 lighted by its beauty. It went from the Fair to adorn 
 the table of the President of the United States. 

To John Houch, of , for the best five pounds of 

butter, a set of silver tea spoons. 

The exhibition of cheese was confined to Mr. Job 
 Hayes and Miss Hayes, and the premiums are awarded 
 To Job Hayes for best 50 lbs. of cheese, one year old, 

a silver medal. 
 To Miss H. M. Hayes for second best, $5 

To Miss Hannah Mary Hayes for best 50 lbs. cheese 

made this year, a silver medal. 

To Job Hayes for best dairy of cheese from one 

county, $20 

To John Young, Harrisburg, for the best 10 lbs. of 
 honey, - 5

Before me, the subscriber, one of the Justices in and 
 for said county, personally came Jacob M. Decker, who, 
 being duly sworn, doth depose and say, that in pursu- 
 ance of the requirements of the Pennsylvania State 
 Agricultural Society, he did upon the 29th day of Au- 
 gust, 1855, set apart and keep separate the milk of five 
 cows from the residue of the dairy, and for the twenty 
 days next following did churn the milk of the same five 
 cows, and obtained from it the amount of one hundred 
 and eight and one-half pounds of butter, a sample of 
 which has been forwai'ded to the Secretary of the State 
 Society; the cows belonging to Judge Jessup, of Mon- 
 trose. The ages and stock of said five cows are as fol- 
 lows : one nine years, two seven years, one five years, 
 and one four years of age, and all about three-fourths
