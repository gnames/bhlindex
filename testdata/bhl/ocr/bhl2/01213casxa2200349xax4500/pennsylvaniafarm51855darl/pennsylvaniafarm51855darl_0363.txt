We regret that there was no sample of cider kept sweet 
 one year, on exhibition. We recommend the offered premi- 
 um to be continued. We also suggest the propriety of offer- 
 ing premiums for dried fruits, dried by the most expeditious 
 and perfect method, with description of the mode or machi- 
 nery used. Also for tho best apple butter made from apples 
 without any addition, with mode of making, and specimens 
 of tho fruit used. And we suggest the great advantage of 
 having the entries made in tho committees book, each under 
 its appropriate heading, so that apples, pears, and all other 
 items may stand together. 

(Specimens of all the premium fruits were collected and 
 presented by the Society, to the President of tho United 
 States, on the occasion of his visit.)

No. 30. — Flowers, Plants and Designs. 
 To James Gowen, President: — Your committee in Class 
 10, No. 30, on Plants, Flowers, and Designs, beg leave to re- 
 spectfully report, that having had the pleasant duty assigned 
 them of an examination of the Floral treasures on exhibition 
 at the Fifth Annual Fair of the Pennsylvania State Agri- 
 cultural Society, may truly say, "their path has been strewn 
 with flowers," and, although this class has not been as fully 
 represented as some of the others, yet, the display is most 
 creditable to the exhibitors. The plants show good cultiva- 
 tion, and the designs and floral ornaments have been got up 
 by those who evidently understand their business. They 
 therefore take pleasure in awarding the following premiums: 
 To John Loban, of Harrisburg, for collection of green 

house plants owned by one person, a premium of $10 
 To A. A. Tanguy, of West Chester, for the greatest vari- 
 ety of roses, a premium of 3

a premium of 2

 benas, a premium of 3

Our attention was also called to a specimen of Osago Or- 
 ange Hedging, by Mr. A. Harshbarger, of Newton-Hamilton, 

Mifflin co. Your committee having no special authority for 
 awarding a premium, do yet feel a desire in consideration of 
 the great and growing necessity for this kind of fencing, and 
 also in consideration of Mr. Harshbarger being the first who 
 has entered regularly into the business of planting and trim- 
 ming hedges, suggest to the Society, the awarding to Mr. 
 Harshbarger of a silver cup valued at $10. All of which is 
 respectfully submitted.
