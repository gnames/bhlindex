■wholly a voluntary act, and results from the exercise of 
 the functions of animal life ; its digestion and absorption 
 ■when there is altogether involuntary. The whole pro- 
 cess of chylification and lacteal absorption proceeds 
 •without our consciousness, and cannot be controlled by 
 any effort of our will. We feel invigorated by the food 
 ■which we have taken, but this is produced by vital 
 operations which nature has not trusted to our guidance, 
 as they are too intimately associated with the life which 
 she seeks to preserve. All these internal motions are in 
 fact purely vegetative acts, proceeding from the opera- 
 tion of that life which we have in common with plants. 

Free-Martin Cows. 

West Chester, Oct. 8, 1855. 

L. L. Darlinoton, Esq. — Dear Sir: — In one of the 
 numbers of the "Farm Journal" of last year, I pre- 
 sented you a communication in regard to Free-Martin 
 cows ; as to the cause of their sterility, I will now com- 
 municate to you in a concise form the examination of a 
 heifer, which lately came under my observation on the 
 farm of Mr. Benedict Giieen, of Pocopson township. 

Whether it was a Free-Martin or not cannot be defin- 
 itely settled, since it was purchased of a Maryland dro- 
 ver ; but the dissection shows the same malformation in 
 the funnel, with a differently formed womb from the one 
 before communicated. 

The external parts were perfect ; the funnel also per- 
 fect for about eight inches, here complete occlusion 
 commenced and continued about two and a half inches, 
 when we arrived at the womb, which was of a complete 
 triangular form, with base and sides of about three 
 inches in length. Communicating with the upper angles 
 were the fallopian tubes, completely impervious and four 
 inches in length ; attached to the broad ligaments were 
 perfect ovaries, but of a much smaller size than in the 
 perfectly formed animal. 

Here then we have another case of sterility caused by 
 the same malformation as that which was last published 
 in your Journal, and the question as to birth would now 
 place us one point nearer the solution of this much 
 mooted point, as to the cause of sterility in cows bearing 
 the name of Free-Martin, but I fear we shall be unable 
 to ascertain any thing upon this point. 

I would again request you to call the attention of 
 farmers to this matter, and any specimens sent will be 
 gladly examined and reported to you for their benefit. 
 Very respectfully, 

Wm. II. WoRTHINGTON. 

Cranberry Culture. 

Mode of Cultivation. — The cranberry may be pro- 
 pagated from the seed, or from cutting, or by trans- 
 planting. The first crop obtained from planting the 
 seed will ordinarily be a year or two later than that 
 produced by wild plants transplanted. It is, therefore, 
 found to be more profitable to transplant, except in one 
 or two sections of the State, where the interest in trans- 
 planting has been so great that $10 a square rod is not 
 an uncommon price for plants, where the ground is 
 thickly covered. 

Where it is desired to propagate by slips or cuttings, 
 ine usual practice is to gather a large quantity of vines, 

and run them through a common hay-cutter, until they 
 are reduced to the length desired — an inch or so — when 
 they may be sown broadcast and harrowed in ; though 
 it is considered best, on some accounts, to sow in drills 
 and cover properly. These slips very soon take root, 
 starting from the base of the leaves, and at the same 
 time shooting up many rising branches. 

If sown broadcast and harrowed, they should not be 
 overflowed till the slips have taken root, as otherwise, 
 many remaining uncovered, will be floated off. 

In the case of cranberries growing wild, it is a com- 
 mon and well known practice to flow or cover them with 
 water during the winter and early spring. This is very 
 desirable, if the situation is such as to allow it, though 
 it is not generally considered essential by those who 
 have been most successful. It is often useful where 
 there are facilities for flowing, to let the water remain a 
 few inches deep till the spring is well advanced, (some 
 think till the first of May, or even later,) to retard the 
 blossoming till there is no danger from frosts. Facilities 
 for flowing are desirable in the cultivation of cranberries 
 also ; and if the plantation could be so arranged as to 
 flow very quickly, it might be of essential service, occa- 
 sionally, during the spring and autumn. 

As the cranberry, in its natural state, is more fre- 
 quently found growing in a low, wet swamp or marsh, 
 that kiud of land is generally selected for its cultivation. 
 The mode of setting out the cranberry in such a swamp 
 if we suppose it to be covered with bushes and grass, 
 and surrounded b} 7 a sandy soil, or in the immediate 
 neighborhood of sand, would be as follows: First, cut 
 the bushes and pare off the surface turf to the depth of 
 three or four inches, so as to remove, as far as possible, 
 the roots of grasses and bushes ; then level the whole, 
 by filling in sand to the depth of from two to four or five 
 inches, according to circumstances. It is desirable that 
 the surface of the sand should be raised but slightly 
 above the level of the water of the swamp, meadow or 
 pond filled up, so that, by digging into the sand with 
 the hand or hoe, the water may be found within two or 
 three inches of the surface. 

The plants should be taken up with the spade in square 
 turfs of the thickness of two or three inches, this being 
 the depth to which the roots generally descend. When 
 the ground has been levelled and prepared as directed 
 above, it will be convenient to draw straight lines and 
 set the roots about eighteen inches apart one way, and 
 one foot the other, in small clusters of about five or six 
 together, the grasses taken up with them in the turf 
 having first been removed from them. The practice of 
 some has been to set the turf, thus taken up, into the 
 row without removing the grass ; but the vines are so 
 tenacious of life that there is little danger of their dying, 
 even if all their natural earth is removed from their 
 roots, and those who have followed this method have 
 generally less trouble in the subsequent cultivation. 

Some prefer to set them in rows at a greater distance 
 apart, having the rows two and a half or three feet, and 
 the plants one foot in the rows. If the sand is thick 
 and loose, so as to make it impracticable to cultivate the 
 vines and pull up the weeds and grasses, on account of 
 the danger of starting the roots, the closer the plants 
 are set the better, since they will thus the sooner cover
