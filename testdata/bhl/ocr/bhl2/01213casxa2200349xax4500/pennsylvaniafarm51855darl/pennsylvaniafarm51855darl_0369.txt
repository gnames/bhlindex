the ground and get the advantage of the grasses. Where 
 it is not intended to hoe the plants in such situations, a 
 foot each -way will probably be the most convenient dis- 
 tance between the plants. 

The cost in such cases varies from $100 to $400 per 
 acre. Under the most favorable circumstances I have 
 never known an acre to fall below $125, and that, too, 
 when it has been prepared in the most economical way, 
 all the labor being performed by the owner himself. 
 The cost, including the original preparation by paring, 
 fencing, filling with sand, procuring and setting out the 
 roots, has more frequently been $300 per acre. When 
 the roots are thus transplanted, a foot or a foot and a 
 half being left between them, they are expected to spread 
 and entirely cover the ground in about three years. If 
 the position be a peat meadow, substantially the same 
 course should be pursued. 

There has been some difference of opinion as to the 
 use of peat or sand after the incipient grubbing and 
 paring has been done ; but the weight of opinion seems 
 to be in favor of the sand, not because -the cranberry 
 will not grow equally as well in peat, but because the 
 grasses growing so abundantly in peat increase the labor 
 of cultivation. A somewhat similar mode of procedure 
 is sometimes adopted in the case of ordinary low mea- 
 dows or swamps. If the meadow is covered with bushes 
 and tussocks, remove the former with the grubber, cut 
 the tussocks off level with the surface, when the vines, 
 being taken from another part of the meadow or else- 
 where, are set by first striking the boe iu'o the soil and 
 raising it slightly, when the roots are inserted and 
 pressed down with the foot. 

The mode of Mr. Leland, of Middlesex, Mass., was to 
 cut out squares of turf corresponding to the squares of 
 cranberry vines, which he placed in their stead, and 
 keep the vines under water from spring till July to de- 
 stroy the worms. 

Mr. Thomas H. Samson, of Plymouth, Mass., removed 
 the whortle bushes and alders, tussocks and tops of the 
 soil, and early in the spring set about one-fourth with 
 cranberry vines without any dressing. He continued 
 annually for three years to set the same quantity, a part 
 of which he covered with a dressing of gravel and soil 
 about an inch in thickness, and a part with sand and 
 gravel, and sowed over the lot a bushel of cranberries, 
 first crushing them and mixing with sand. He finds no 
 beneficial effect from the sand — finds his cranberries do 
 best where the peat or mud is deepest. He flowed his 
 cranberries from October to April. His products were 
 at the rate of 250 bushels per acre. Has no faith in 
 raising cranberries on dry soil. 

Other experiments, however, show the practicability 
 of raising cranberries on upland. Mr. Roberts' experi- 
 ment embraced a tract near the foot of a slope descend- 
 ing in a westerly direction. The ground was plowed 
 eight inches deep and harrowed; light furrows, three 
 and a half feet apart, were run lengthwise, and the sods 
 were cut from the swamp, carted on the upland, and 
 placed three feet apart in the rows (though two would 
 have been better), then carefully hoed and kept free 
 from weeds for two years. No water was supplied, ex- 
 cept that received from occasional rains. 

In the cultivation of cranberries, whether on upland 

or lowland, it is very Important that the ground should 
 be entirely covered by the vines as soon after planting 
 as possible, not only on account of the great saving of 
 labor, by thus preventing the growth of grass and weeds, 
 but also because very little fruit is commonly produced 
 until the vines have thus spread over the surface. At 
 the end of three years the whole ground should be cov- 
 ered ; but in the instances of upland culture referred to 
 it was not so, though the plantation had been set there 
 at least three or four years. Probably if the roots had 
 been but twelve or eighteen inches apart, the result 
 would have been different in this respect. As it was, 
 however, the yield in 1852 was one bushel to the square 
 rod, or 160 bushels to the acre, when cranberries were 
 selling readily at $4 per bushel. 

Ripening of Apples and Pears. 

There are, in the following article from the Genesee 
 Farmer, several good hints which are applicable to the 
 season : 

To have sound and perfect apples through the winter 
 months, it is absolutely necessary that much care should 
 be given in gathering. This should be deferred with 
 the winter fruit as late as practicable, and avoid early 
 severe frosts. The fruit should be picked from the tree 
 by means of ladders, and placed in baskets, when it 
 should be assorted and packed at once into new tight 
 barrels. These barrels, after heading, should be re- 
 moved on sleds to a shed through which the air circu- 
 lates freely, or they might be protected easily from the 
 dew and rain by placing boards over them. They may 
 be allowed to remain in this situation a week or more, 
 or until the cold is too severe, when they should be 
 transferred to a cool, dry cellar, and into which air may 
 be admitted in mild weather. The barrels should then 
 be placed in tiers upon their sides, numbering upon eacli 
 head the quality of the fruit contained in the barrel, and 
 the name. The small imperfect but sound fruit is treat- 
 ed in the same manner, and marked No. 2, indicating an 
 inferior sort. Apples which are intended for market are 
 frequently assorted into three different classes, the best, 
 good, and inferior — the former being all selected fruit ; 
 the good containing sound fruit of medium or small spe 
 cimens ; the third being so poor that the fruit is wholly 
 unfit for market, and suitable only for stock or imme- 
 diate family use. All of this is easily done, yet many 
 whole orchards bring but an inferior price for want of 
 this care. 

Too often we find that winter apples are left upon the 
 tree very late in the autumn, frequently till they have 
 been exposed to two or three severe frosts ; when con- 
 venient they are shaken from the trees, the good and bad 
 poured into barrels or open wagons, of perhaps half a 
 dozen sorts. Afterwards they are emptied promiscuous- 
 ly into bins, barrels, or open boxes, where they are 
 expected to keep well through winter. This is a most 
 ruinous method, yet it is practised by at least three- 
 fourths of the farmers ; or they adopt another course 
 equally as wasteful in securing the fruit. 

Fully one-half is lost by this method of gathering, as 
 the fruit ripens prematurely and decays rapidly by being 
 bruised. The decay is very much hastened where sev- 
 eral sorts are mixed promiscuously together, ripening at
