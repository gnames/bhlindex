as many different seasons. Those kinds, too, which do 
 not come to maturity till late in the winter or early in 
 the spring, are turned and handled many times when 
 assorting those which are in season during November 
 and December. 

Light is found unfavorable to the keeping of fruit, and 
 should be excluded ; and it is often noticed that where 
 fruit, particularly pears, is placed in a room above 
 ground, and oftentimes in a very dry cellar, and left ex- 
 posed to the air, they shrivel. They should, therefore, 
 be kept either in barrels or tight boxes. About the 
 time pears are needed for use they can be removed to a 
 room of higher temperature, and kept as closely as be- 
 fore in drawers or boxes, where they will ripen very 
 speedily, and will possess much finer flavor than if al- 
 lowed to ripen in a cooler place. By treating pears in 
 this way, one variety can be made to last a long time. 

Summer pears ought to be gathered a week before 
 ripe ; early autumn kinds about ten days or more ; late 
 fall and winter varieties ought to be allowed to hang 
 upon the trees as long as they may and escape frost. 

There is yet very much to learn in ripening winter 
 pears well, more particularly the late sorts. But few 
 orchardists are there who have been successful in ripen- 
 ing such sorts as Easter Beurre, Josephine de Malvn.es, 
 Prince's St. Germain, and many other late winter kinds. 
 In fact, it is found almost impossible with the fruit 
 rooms, conveniences, and cellars now in ordinary use. 
 Some few enterprising persons in this country have ex- 
 pended considerable sums in buildings, etc., to ripen 
 winter sorts, and in the main succeed well ; but it is 
 quite useless for farmers and many others to plant trees 
 of such varieties of fruit that require so much care in 
 ripening, unless they are prepared to embark into it ex- 
 tensively, erect the necessary buildings, and give close 
 attention to it ; then it will pay and prove quite remu- 
 nerative ; otherwise all trials or experiments will be 
 quite unsatisfactory. 

The Wyandott Corn. 

We have received from Mr. J. C. Thompson, of Tomp- 
 kins ville, Staten- Island, N. Y., a full description of this 
 new, and in some respects extraordinary variety of In- 
 dian corn, from which we condense the following : 

Last spring he planted twenty-four grains, procured 
 from Mr. James B. Thomas, of Waverly, 111., in hills 
 four feet apart, one kernel in a hill. About the first 
 week in May eighteen grains came up, which at first did 
 not differ in appearance from the ordinary corn. When 
 about eighteen inches high, shoots (not suckers) began 
 to spring up from the roots, to the number of seven in 
 some hills. These secondary shoots soon outstripped 
 the main stalk, and grew to the height of ten feet and 
 over. Up to the first week in August there was little 
 prospect of any yield of corn, though there were inci- 
 pient ears numbering as high as thirty on a hill. 

During August those cars developed rapidly, so that 
 seventeen hills contained eighty-two stalks, bearing one 
 hundred and twenty-three good ears and one hundred 
 and five immature sets for ears, which our season is not 
 sufficiently long to mature. All this resulted from only 
 seventeen kernels. One of the hills had six stalks, thir- 
 teen mature and eighteen immature ones. 

The corn was in an unfavorable location, being shaded 
 on the east and west by trees, which shut out the morn- 
 ing and evening sun. The rapid filling out and growth 
 of the ears in September, is represented as really aston- 
 ishing to all who watched its progrecs. The peculiarity 
 of the variety seems to be, first, a full development of 
 stalks and leaves from shoots springing from the roots, 
 and afterwards a rapid growth and maturing of the ears 
 during August and September. Mr. Thompson states 
 that he shall have some of the seed to dispose of. 

He also forwarded to us a copy of a letter from Mr. 
 Thomas, dated Waverly, 111., Aug. 17, from which we 
 make the following extracts : 

My crop of Wyandott was planted at intervals between 
 the 1st and 15th of May, on a flat piece of land which 
 had been cultivated four years. A cold, wet spell of 
 weather setting in about a week after planting, and con- 
 tinuing some two weeks, chilled the earth to such a de- 
 gree that the seed was tardy in germinating, and greatly 
 retarded in its growth after coming up. A severe frost 
 cut the stalk completely off, compelling me to replant 
 about one-half my crop. I also had the cut-worm, the 
 mole, and the field-mouse to contend with, each of which 
 attempted to outvie the other in their destructive pranks, 
 and all of which were very pestiferous to farmers in this 
 section the first of the season. But notwithstanding all 
 these difficulties, my crop of Wyandott is pronounced 
 by the farmers who have visited it to be one of the 
 greatest wonders ever witnessed by them. The stalk is 
 about twelve feet high, as large in circumference as an 
 ordinary man's wrist — averaging four stalks in a hill, 
 and bearing from eight to twenty ears, and some as high 
 as twenty-four ears to a hill, and all from one grain. 
 Why, my dear sir, it looks or sounds Munchausen-like, 
 but it is here in my crop incontestably demonstrated ; 
 and, if nothing unforseen occurs to prevent, will be 
 witnessed by thousands of persons at our State Fair, at 
 Chicago, next October. 

I planted five acres, and allowing for devastation be- 
 fore mentioned, I presume I shall have about four acres 
 to gather. My crop is filling out rapidly, though late. 
 I noticed particularly in 1854, that the Wyandott ma- 
 tured much more rapidly than any other description 
 growing, and this fact has been remarked to me by sev- 
 eral this season. I sincerely hope it may prove so in 
 your section. You are situated, I believe, in latitude 
 about 41° ; we are in about 39° 40 / — a slight difference 
 in our favor. On the other hand, the difference in lon- 
 gitude being some 15°, is in your favor. However, a 
 short time will test to the satisfaction of all, whether it 
 will answer in your climate. — Amer. Agriculturist.

The Loves of the Spider. 

Did the reader ever watch the terrible coquetry of the 
 female spider ? We say terrible, for it is a perilous game 
 for the young gentleman; if he misinterprets her looks 
 and actions, if his vanity or the thoughtlessness of youth 
 induce him to imagine he has inspired a passion deeper 
 than coquetry, she does not, as our coquettes do, draw 
 up her head and cooly declare "there must be some mis- 
 take," but pounces on the unlucky coxcomb, and slays 
 him on the spot ! Prescient of such a possibility, it is 
 wonderful to see how stealthily and humbly the gallant 
 gay Lothario pays his court.
