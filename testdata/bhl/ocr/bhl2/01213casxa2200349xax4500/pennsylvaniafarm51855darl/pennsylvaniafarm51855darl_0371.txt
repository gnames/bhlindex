Address of the Hon. Fred'k Watts, at the Fifth Annual 
 Exhibition of the Pennsylvania State Fair. 

The last few years has given birth to a new era. Our at- 
 tention has been arrested and our minds suddenly called to 
 contemplate the importance of agriculture. Cultivators of 
 the earth have been invited, aye, pressed to take their place 
 in the race which is now being run in the world's progress. 
 They have been startled by the sound that has been made 
 for them; and they begin' to think that there is work to do 
 beyond the precincts of the farm. They begin to feel, too, 
 that the spirit of the enlightened mind whieh alone can 
 give a right direction to the operations of matter has been at 
 work for them. 

To those who have put their hands and hearts to the work 
 of promoting this great interest, there is a pleasing consola- 
 tion, and effective encouragement, too, in the reflection, that 
 they are upon the flowing tide of public favor; that those 
 they benefit now look with confidence and pleasure upon the 
 efforts they make ; that whilst the fluctuations of business, 
 the casualties of commerce, the interruptions of trade, the 
 disturbances of society itself, are but incidents of the mo- 
 ment, only occurring to be as soon forgotten. That whilst 
 amidst all the other and conflicting elements of busy life, the 
 pleasing anticipations and profitable speculations of one 
 class are the dreaded forebodings and dire calamities of an- 
 other; all classes unite in the fervent prayer, the kindly 
 sympathy, the liveliest hope, that success may crown the 
 effort of the farmer. His art now commands the study of 
 the philosopher, the science of the scholar, the eloquence of 
 the statesmen ; the wholo world, with an unanimity which 
 no other subject can command lifts up its sympathizing voice 
 to cry, " God speed the plough." 

There is a reason for this to be found in the fact, that the 
 product of this art contributes more largely than any other 
 to human happiness, and that the art itself is better adapted 
 to human skill. 

How shall we best promote this great object, is a question 
 which addresses itself to all of us with a force which must 
 command our attention. 

First, then, study to know the subject which thus excites 
 our common interest. Is it enough to understand, that if 
 the earth be stirred, and the seeds be sown, that their pro- 
 duct and all else is a natural result of God's providence. Is 
 it enough that we should be told and believe that the plough 
 is the best implement with which to till the earth, and that 
 seed sown and gathered by the hand of man is all that is 
 necessary to enable us to drag through the natural period of 
 our existence, thus made toilsome and miserable? Is it 
 enough, as to ourselves, to know that we live and move and 
 have our being? Is that large portion of mankind who are 
 engaged in that great first work of the world, content thus 
 to grovel and crawl, only occasionally to be startled into an 
 attitude of amazement at the products of the minds of men 
 around them; and again to relapse into the contemplation of 
 their own inferior condition? We answer emphatically, no ! 
 With regard to your own occupation you should rather look 
 upon this lovely earth as the beautiful landscape of God's 
 creation, embued with the powers of life to breathe and feed, 
 yielding its elements and products to the delicate and nurs- 
 ing operations of your hands. 

Whilst you follow the plough, you should perceive its use ; 
 you should see in it, how the polished mind of man has in- 
 fused mechanical science into its structure. You should mark 
 well the work it has to do and its adaptation to the work. 
 You should contemplate those seeds you commit to the earth, 
 and believe that it is not the work of chance that they grow 
 — and that they too are embued with the germinating pow- 
 ers of light and life, characterized in their existence by the 

qualities of good and bad. And you should know that per- 
 fect analogy which characterizes the life at its conception, 
 the growth in its progress, the product of its results, and the 
 final death of all animal and vegetable creation. But above 
 all and over all, you should contemplate yourselves; that 
 you are a part of the special work of God's hands, placed 
 here and employed to direct and govern all these things. 
 They are no artificial objects on which you are to expend 
 your happy thoughts and lives, they are the delightful things 
 of nature on which you operate, and nature operates with 
 you in all your labors and sweetens them to your contented 
 spirit. This is the grand socret of your constant attach- 
 ment to and engagement of agricultural pursuits. You work 
 with nature and only modulate and benefit by her functions, 
 as she takes up and quickens and completes the work of your 
 hands. There is a living, moving, acting principle in all 
 your labors which distinguish them from other pursuits. 
 The earth yields its strength and increase to the seed you 
 cast upon it — to the cattle that walk upon it — the winds seem 
 to blow, the rains to fall, and the waters to run for you. The 
 very frosts and snows of winter give salutary checks to the 
 rankness of vegetation, lighten the soil, and destroy what is 
 noxious for you — and every principle of animal and vegeta- 
 ble organization and existence co-operate to support and en- 
 rich you. There is a charm in this which must last while 
 the spirit of man feels the stirrings of the spirit and power 
 of God around him. 

Farmers do not reason thus, but they feel it, and it is this 
 mysterious and self-acting charm which has infused its sweet- 
 ness into the hearts of all rural people, in all ages of the 
 world. 

That farmers are not as intelligent and well informed as 
 a parallel grade of society in towns, we mean to assert — that 
 they are not as truly aware of and united to defend their real 
 interests, we mean to proclaim. Their scattered and isolated 
 mode of life weighs against them on these points — but that 
 they have more sincere hearts, and a sounder morality, is as 
 indisputable. They have apureness of purpose, a simplicity 
 of mind as well as manners, that is more than an equivalent 
 for the polish and conventional customs of society ; and with 
 it a cordiality which is only to be found in the good, homely, 
 hearty hospitality of a country house. 

We have thus endeavored to impress upon you that, whilst 
 you have much yet to learn, yours is a happy condition in 
 life ; and that your pursuit is so essential, and its improve- 
 ment so important to yourselves and the world at large, as 
 to claim for it a high place in the estimation of mankind. 
 And it is for you to make this claim, for the world never re- 
 spects the man who does not respect himself. 

You are to take your place, then, in that race of honorable 
 competition into which all the trades and occupations of life 
 have entered, and whose goal is the honor and glory of exalt- 
 ing their own profession, and adding so much to the sum of 
 human happiness. Who possesses advantages superior to 
 yours? With every quality of soil, and with a climate which 
 breathes into all the essential vegetables the breath of life, 
 and into man the atmosphere of health; what do you want 
 but to call into action the native strength of your own mind 
 and the energies of your own hands. 

And in this connection let me disabuso your minds of tho 
 hackneyed and thoughtless expression that farmers and their 
 societies should have nothing to do with politics. It has 
 been quaintly and wisely said, that "politics is the science 
 of government;" and in the operations of that government 
 you are the operatives, and you are in duty bound to take an 
 active and energetic part. We mean, not that miserable 
 conspiracy among men, which has no other object than tho 
 pursuit of that power which gives to one party and takas
