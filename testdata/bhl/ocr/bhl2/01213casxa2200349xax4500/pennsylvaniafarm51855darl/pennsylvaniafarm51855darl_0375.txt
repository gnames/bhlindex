and powers. Free from the anxieties and perplexities 
 of the merchant or the professional man, and surrounded 
 by influences favorable to health of both body and mind, 
 he has every thing to encourage within him a feeling of 
 lofty pride and independence. The book of nature is 
 constantly open before him. From its pages he learns 
 her laws, and finds in their study a source of pure and 
 exalted happiness. He looks upon his profession with 
 feelings of pride and pleasure, because he finds it an art 
 intimately associated with the highest attainments of 
 human genius. The beauties as well as the bounties of 
 nature are unfolded to him. His pursuits are in admi- 
 rable keeping with all that is beautiful and instructive 
 in the animal and vegetable world, and they implant in 
 his bosom a feeling of honest independence and self re- 
 spect, of which nothing can ever deprive him. 

Respecting it himself, he teaches his children to respect 
 it likewise. For him the learned professions have no 
 charms. He does not sigh to see his sons figuring be- 
 hind the merchant's counter. He has seen thousands of 
 young men rushing with blind haste into professions al- 
 ready crowded to overflowing, only to meet with disap- 
 pointment, and not unfrequently with poverty and shame. 
 Turning from this mad chase after distinction and wealth, 
 he regards with conscious pride his own peaceable and 
 independent calling, knowing that intelligent, well di- 
 rected industry will always meet with a full and honora- 
 ble reward. He invests it with all the charms which a 
 cultivated intellect can bring to bear upon it, and by in- 
 telligently pointing out its superiority over almost every 
 other human pursuit, teaches the sons who are to suc- 
 ceed him a proper reverence for the profession of their 
 parent. 

He has learned to know that "knowledge is power" — 
 moral power — and therefore hastens to throw around 
 his children the bulwarks he has found so efficient in the 
 hour of temptation, when the proudest and strongest tot- 
 tered and fell beneath the allurements of the tempter. 
 His fireside is the home of pure enjoyment. The trashy 
 literature of the day finds no place upon his book-shelf, 
 for he has discovered a world of treasure in those vol- 
 umes which open to him the hidden mysteries of his 
 calling, and these treasures of knowledge are imparted 
 to those who look to him confidently for counsel. Thus 
 encouraged by a father's example, the sons forget their 
 longings for the empty pretensions of city life — they 
 wield the scythe or delve with the spade with the lofty 
 consciousness that they are engaged in an occupation 
 than which none is more dignified or ennobling — a call- 
 ing which "leads the feet that have followed the plow 
 through many a weary furrow in the field, to stand on a 
 level with the proudest statesman in the councils of the 
 nation " — a calling, one of whose most impressive lessons 
 is, that 

"The rank is but the guinea's stamp. 
 The man's the gow'd for a' that." 

Look abroad over this land of ours, teeming with the 
 richest of God's blessings, and crowded with all the ele- 
 ments of greatness — a land of unequalled fertility, with 
 a climate adapted to the growth of almost every plant 
 or tree necessary to the comfort or luxury of man. To 
 us, the nations of the old world look for supplies when 
 their crops fail. Such is the immensity of our agricul- 

tural resources, that nothing is wanting to make the 
 United States the granary of the world, but the proper 
 application of science to the cultivation of her soils. To 
 accomplish this great end in part, at least, is the duty 
 devolving upon the farmers of the present generation — a 
 duty we owe to ourselves, our children, and to our coun- 
 try. How many of those now present are discharging 
 as they should this high trust ? Very many I hope, but 
 if there is a single one who is remiss, to him let the truths 
 feebly presented carry the conviction of his error. If 
 there is one farmer within reach of my voice, who has 
 failed to supply himself with some at least of the thou- 
 sand sources of valuable information with which the 
 country is flooded, and which may be procured almost 
 for the asking, (so cheap has agricultural literature" be- 
 come,) to such an one I take the liberty of saying, friend, 
 you are in error ! If there is one here who opposes the 
 views presented, because to him they smatter of what is 
 called Book-Farming, (which, by so many who delight in 
 being regarded as practical men, is wholly discarded — 
 men who do not believe that science has aught to do with 
 the cultivation of the soil,) to such an one allow me also 
 to say, friend, you are in error ! 

Why do you form agricultural societies, and why are 
 exhibitions, such as the one of to-day, held ? Is it not 
 that the farmers of Susquehanna county may be assem- 
 bled in a grand fraternal meeting — interchange thoughts 
 and sentiments in regard to their profession — relate to 
 each other their experience, and by comparing the pro- 
 ducts here exhibited which are the results of one system 
 of culture, with those the result of another system, learn 
 from the comparison, that which is best adapted to their 
 particular purposes ? An agricultural periodical is in 
 its design almost identically the same. It is intended 
 to be the vehicle of communication between farmer and 
 farmer. Through its pages the well informed practical 
 agriculturist conveys to its tens of thousands of readers 
 the results of years of experience in the cultivation of 
 some particular crop or crops. This experience is thus 
 made the property of all, and is it any the less valuable 
 because it is presented through the columns of an agri- 
 cultural periodical, instead of being communicated ver- 
 bally ? Horace Greeley, in an address delivered before 
 the Indiana Agricultural Society a few years since, illus- 
 trates this point so aptly, that I cannot forbear quoting a 
 few sentences: 

"What is in effect contended for by the advocates of 
 book-farming is simply this — that a farmer, like any ar- 
 tisan, while he needs practical experience, may also pro- 
 fit by the practical experience of others. For example : A 
 new plant or vegetable is introduced, which onr anti- 
 book farmer concludes to try, though totally ignorant of 
 its nature and season. Let us suppose the nearest 
 neighbor who has ever grown this plant lives five miles 
 away. Now, will not this new experimenter, if he have 
 a decent share of common sense, ride over and ask the 
 experienced cultivator what soil is best adapted to this 
 plant ; what manures are best for it, what time it should 
 be planted or sowed, how cultivated, &c. , &c. ? Plainly, 
 it would be sheer madness for him to omit such inquiries, 
 and go on as if there had been no preceding experience, 
 to answer all these questions and determine all these 
 points for himself, by hap-hazard planting on every va-
