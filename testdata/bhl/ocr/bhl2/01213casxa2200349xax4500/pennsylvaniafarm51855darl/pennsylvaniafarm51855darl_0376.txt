riety of soil, at every possible season, with any or every 
 sort of fertilizer ! By so doing he must spend several 
 hundred dollars to determine what he might readily have 
 ascertained at the cost of a dollar. Well ; if he could 
 turn to the proper page of an Agricultural Dictionary 
 or Periodical, and there learn exactly when this new 
 plant should be sown in this latitude, how manured, 
 how cultivated, &c, would not that be still easier and 
 cheaper than to ride over to his distant neighbor's ? 
 Would it not be highly probable that the directions con- 
 tained in the book, being founded on a wide range of 
 experiments, would be more reliable and complete than 
 his neighbor's counsel, based on his narrow personal ex- 
 perience ? A prudent man would probably consult both 
 book and neighbor, and then follow either only so far as 
 his own judgment should dictate ; but how can any one 
 approve his taking counsel of one man's experience, yet 
 condemn a course which is, in fact, but paying deference 
 to the experience of maty thousands ?" 

But I have already detained you longer than I should. 
 Allow me, therefore, in conclusion, to remark, that 
 neither novelty or originality is claimed for what has 
 been said. It has been my endeavor to present in as 
 familiar a manner as possible some few of the truths, a 
 knowledge of which is indispensable to successful farm- 
 ing ; and if I have succeeded in convincing a single far- 
 mer who has hitherto stood aloof from the progressive 
 movements of the age — that his course is in diametrical 
 opposition to his best interests, both moral and pecuni- 
 ary, a part, at least, of the object sought in coming into 
 your midst has been accomplished. But I will hope for 
 better results. There is a brighter day coming for 
 agriculture. One by one the ties which bind the present 
 generation to the "good old ways" of past ages, are 
 being severed. Science and practice have joined hands, 
 and though we dare not hope that we shall all live to see 
 the day when the chemist, the geologist, the botanist, or 
 the machinist, will so far have overcome the obstacles 
 which now lie in the pathway of perfect success, as to 
 make it easy for every one who cultivates the soil, still 
 we have the indications that our sons and daughters 
 will. Let us aid, therefore, in hastening this happy day 
 by throwing around those who are to suceeed us all the 
 influences calculated to develop their intellectual and 
 moral faculties — by striving, as far as lies in the power 
 of each, to stimulate their budding energies by our own 
 example — by placing within their reach all the means 
 necessary to keep pace with the advancing spirit of the 
 age — by teaching them to respect the profession for which 
 they are preparing themselves, and that the intelligent 
 cultivation of the soil is not only one of the most digni- 
 fied, honorable and independent of all earthly pursuits, 
 but that to advance its interests in every possible way is 
 a duty they owe themselves, their country, and mankind. 

Willow Culture in Summit County, Ohio. 
 Editor Farmer — Sir : — Last April, I bought of Geo. 
 J. Colby, of Vt., fifty thousand Willow Cuttings. We 
 got through sticking them the loth of May, and now 
 many of the sprouts are six feet long, and all will aver- 
 age about four feet. They will pay well this year, if 
 there should be sale for the cuttings. My ground was 
 only ploughed, for the wet weather commenced before I 

knew that I should obtain any cuttings, but we were 
 particular to put the cuttings clear through the sod, into 
 the soil below, and only a few of them failed to grow. 
 The best time to prepare the ground is in the fall, for 
 most of the land, that is suitable for the willow, is too 
 wet to till in the spring, early enough. It takes about 
 three day's work to stick an acre with the cuttings, it 
 should be done early in the spring, before other work 
 commences, so that it can be done well without costing 
 too much per acre. 

From what I know of the willow trade and the culti- 
 vation of the willow, there is no doubt, in my mind, that 
 farmers will find it very lucrative to grow them. Most 
 every farmer has some land on which nothing but trash 
 grows, which is just the land for the willow.

Retiring from Business. 
 It is very common to hear persons who are engaged 
 in active concerns of life, express a desire to become 
 speedily rich, so that they may retire from business. 
 This appears to be almost universally the object of the 
 business of man's toil. But we venture to say that in 
 no respect were people ever more generally deluded than 
 in this. They expect to find nothing but happiness. upon 
 leaving what they have been accustomed to regard as the 
 harassing cares of business — they actually find nothing 
 but misery. In nine cases out of ten the man who has 
 retired from business and laid aside his active habits, 
 finds cause daily to regret the step he has taken, and to 
 wish himself back again. Happiness is not to be found 
 in idleness, but in a faithful discharge of the active 
 duties of life. Man was not intended as an idle being, 
 and it was a wise ordinance that by the sweat of his 
 brow he should eat bread. The necessity of activity 
 and labor imposed upon the human race tends to the 
 promotion of virtue and of substantial enjoyment. It is 
 a true remark of Miss Sedgwick, that "one cannot be 
 very unhappy while there is enough to do." 

Watermelon Molasses. 
 An article has been going the rounds of the papers 
 about the practicability of making molasses from water- 
 melons. We felt incredulous on the subject, but have 
 recently been presented with a bottle of it by our friend 
 Philip A. Mason, of Woodbury, New Jersey, who is 
 well known in this market as a successful grower of the 
 mountain sweet watermelon. It was really a nice arti- 
 cle, clear, sweet, and of a very pleasant flavor. He in- 
 formed us the only process was to boil down the pulp to 
 about one-half. The boiling was continued for several 
 hours. Whether it will pay to manufacture molasses in 
 this way is another question, and a matter of very great 
 doubt. 

Horse Shoe without Nails. 
 A Yankee by the name of Short has invented a horse 
 shoe which requires no nails. He makes the whole in 
 two pieces, employing, in addition, two small screws to 
 aid in screwing the parts together. Both are made of 
 malleable iron — the lower portion, or 'sole' being very 
 similar to the horse shoe ordinarily employed, but with
