a groove around its exterior, and without nail holes. 
 The upper portion, or 'Vamp,' is thin, and has a flange 
 projecting inward from its lower edge to match the groove 
 in the sole. The parts are so arranged as to secure a 
 tight and firm connection, and the whole is made addi- 
 tionally secure by the aid of the set screws before men- 
 tioned at the heel. A shoe of this kind once fitted, the 
 vamp may be made to wear out a great number of soles. 
 The exterior may be highly finished and plated with 
 silver, which gives a very flashy appearance to a team of 
 lively horses, or the shoes may be enamelled jet black 
 when intended for white or gray animals. One practical 
 advantage to be derived from this style of shoes is the 
 facility with which they can be removed or exchanged, 
 so that a skillful hostler may exchange the shoes, or 
 rather the soles, on every occasion when the presence of 
 ice or the like renders it desirable, and it may even be 
 expedient in extreme cases of exhaustion, as with race 
 horses, to remove the shoes altogether for a time, and 
 allow of a more refreshing rest. 

More Work for the Season. 

I. Preserve all the strait) and fodder you can. — If it 
 does not find use now, it may before you are aware. 
 Keep such coarse food under cover, (if you have room,) 
 or well stacked out, till you need, and you will find it 
 better than money at interest. 

II. Provide shelter for all your stock. — From one-fifth 
 to one-quarter of your fodder may be saved in this way. 
 Or, what is the same thing, from one-fifth to one-fourth 
 more stock may be wintered on the same food. Besides 
 this, the stock will be more comfortable and in better 
 condition. Nor is the time to attend to this class of 
 matters. The cold autumn storms are at hand, and the 
 cattle and sheep should not be chilled by them. Such 
 drenchings are a poor preparation for the cold of the 
 coming winter. 

III. Sell off, or fatten and Mil the weak and the old in 
 your flocks and herds. — It is far better to make moderately 
 good beef or mutton of a portion of your stock, than to 
 lose them and the food they have consumed, and the labor 
 of caring for them, after the winter has nearly gone. 

Had the farmers of the West pursued this course in 
 the fall of 1854, they would have avoided immense losses. 
 Had they thinned out their stock in this way, the proceeds 
 of slaughtered animals would have purchased food for 
 the rest. And they would have had last spring more 
 stock, and that stock would have been in better condition. 
 For as it was, the poorer stock died worthless, and the 
 rest came out emaciated and wasted, because the food 
 they should have fed to them had been thrown away on 
 those that had died. 

IV. Let the amount of your stock be considerably less 
 than you think your supply of food will keep in good con- 
 dition. — The tendency is generally in the opposite direc- 
 tion. Men do not get the price they desire, for their 
 surplus animals. They let them run on, hoping to secure 
 a more favorable market. Winter finds them with more 
 stock than they want. They dislike to sell or slaughter 
 at a sacrifice. They will try to winter the whole. It 
 may be a mild winter. They will buy hay or corn, if 
 they need it. The last of February comes, and their 
 fodder is consumed. Several cattle, and a half a hundred 

sheep have died. Corn and hay are high ; and now they 
 feel too poor to buy ; so a large portion of their stock 
 has been swept away ! They begin the new year with a 
 dejection which weighs them to the earth. They might 
 have escaped all this, by keeping their stock quite within 
 the limits of their supply of food. 

V. Provide excellent teachers for your children, and have 
 a good school for five months, before time for plowing next 
 spring. — If you should hire a man to break your colts, 
 you would get the best man you could find, if his services 
 cost twice or thrice as much as those of a man who knew 
 nothing about horses. You would ask, ' What are five 
 dollars or ten, compared with the use and value of a 
 horse for his whole life-time ? This would be wise. 
 Exactly so, only with a thousand-fold more emphasis, 
 with respect to your children. Secure the best possible 
 instruction for them at home: make your district-school 
 one of the best select schools. You will thus save money, 
 for your children will not be tempted to run away to 
 some 'Academy,' wasting their time and your dollars to 
 little purpose. A higher style of thought and manners 
 and morals will quietly spring up in your own midst. 
 And your children will be far more likely to escape those 
 pernicous influences which so commonly follow an exile 
 from the purifying and ennobling atmosphere of the 
 parental hearth. 

A good school, viewed in its power over the young 
 soul, shaping its character and destiny, is of such 
 moment, that a few dollars a month in the price of teach- 
 ing is as the dust of the balance in comparison. As 
 among the most important, therefore, of the tasks of the 
 season, do we mention that of securing a good teacher 
 for winter-schools. Home education must be aimed at 
 as far as possible. None other will meet the wants or 
 the means of the great mass of our population. 

VI. Provide shelter for the tools and carriages for the 
 winter, and give a coat of clean oil or grease to the iron, 
 steel, or all tools likely to rust. — A few hours spent in this 
 work, will save many hours next spring, and the dura- 
 bility of all your implements may be doubled. 

VII. If you have a large family of children, or a 
 number of hired persons whom you intend to keep during 
 the winter, cast about to find profitable employment for 
 them till spring. Provide work under cover for the 
 stormy and severe weather. Have plenty of wood cut 
 or split, in a good wood house. In open weather, wood 
 may be cut or rails split in the woods, or timber may be 
 got out ffiv building, or the market. Saw logs may be 
 cut and placed where they can be conveniently shipped 
 to the saw mill when snow comes. If clearing is to be 
 done, it may be economy to do the chopping in the winter. 
 But be sure to save the wood, if you live within a few 
 miles of a village. 

We have suggested a few things which we think 
 seasonable. It requires no great profundity of thought 
 to give these hints. Yet our readers will think them 
 none the less valuable for that. To refresh the memory 
 at the right time, is sometimes worth a great deal, for 
 with the multitude of things a farmer has to remember, 
 it would not be strange if some important ones were now 
 and then forgotten. These tides in the affairs of every 
 man, must be taken at the flood, if they are lead to 
 fortune. Let man be on the crest of the wave.
