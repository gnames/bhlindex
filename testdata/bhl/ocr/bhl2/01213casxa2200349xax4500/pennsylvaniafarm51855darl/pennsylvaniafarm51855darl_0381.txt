Diseases of Horses. 
 Inflammation of the Tongue (Glossitis). — This is 
 generally supposed to arise from injury to the tongue ; 
 but cases frequently occur that cannot be traced to this 
 source. We treated a case of this kind occuring in a 
 horse, the property of Mr. Thomas Bancroft. The ani- 
 mal had performed his usual labor, when, on putting 
 him up at night, the tongue was observed to be swollen, 
 and the tip protruding on one side. On careful exami- 
 nation, no lesion nor injury of any kind could be found. 
 Next day, the tongue was enormously swollen, so that 
 the patient was unable to close the nippers ; he had also 
 inflammatory sore throat, and considerable fever. The 
 treatment consisted in applying stimulating liniment to 
 the throat ; the mouth was kept constantly moist with 
 salt and water, occasionally cramming a handful of salt 
 between the jaws ; he subsisted on thin oatmeal gruel, 
 acidulated with cream of tartar, and got well in six 
 days, without any medicine. Another case was treated 
 in the same manner, which ended in abscess under the 
 jaw, and the patient quickly recovered. 

At times, inflammatory action runs high, when it will 
 be necessary to give a dose of glauber salts ; dose, ten 
 ounces. 

Wounds of the Tongue. — It is very fortunate for 
 horses that wounds occurring in this useful appendage 
 to the mouth generally heal very rapidly : all that is 
 necessary is, to let the animal rest, keep him on a sloppy 
 diet, and apply tincture of arnica to the parts. 

Lampas. — So long as horse owners believe "lampas" 
 to be a disease, and men can be found to "burn it out," 
 as it is sometimes termed, just so long will the error 
 exist, and the barbarism continue. 

Lampas is a term used to signify a state of tumefac- 
 tion existing in the palate, about that part known as the 
 bars, situated in the vicinity of the upper nippers. The 
 tumefaction arises, — 

1. From local emphysema, — windy swelling, — rendering 
 the palate elastic and augmented. 

2. From induration, — abnormal increase in the consis- 
 tence of the palate, — owing to an accumulation of dense 
 particles of blood, which resist a free circulation of that 
 fluid through the parts. 

3. From congestion, either passive or active. 

In passive congestion, there is an excess of blood, in 
 consequence either of weakness in the propelling force, 
 or of an obstacle to the exit of blood from the congested 
 membrane : this state gives rise to swelling of the veins 
 in horses' legs also. Active congestion is a determina- 
 tion of blood to the part, in consequence of local irrita- 
 tion, teething, &c. In aged horses we frequently find 
 the bars of the palate in a state of hypertrophy ; but as 
 this is only an exaggeration of a natural state, we take 
 no notice of it ; in fact, arising in whatever cause it 
 may, (except teething,) lampas does not cause the ani- 
 mal any inconvenience. This opinion, we are aware, 
 will conflict with that of a great many horsemen, who 
 make a practice of searching a horse's mouth whenever 
 he shows the least sign of illness, to see if the "lampas 
 are down;" but let it be understood that the bars or 
 ridges of a horse's mouth correspond to the hard palate 
 in man, which every one knows is not very sensitive, and 
 therefore cannot be the cause of ill health, nor prevent 

the animal from masticating his food. Hence the prac- 
 tice of burning the bars is an unnecessary barbarity, 
 which should never be countenanced. The most that 
 we ever do in cases of lampas is to wash the mouth with 
 a weak solution of alum, or infusion of bayberry bark ; 
 but it often happens that subjects with lampas are 
 brought to us for examination, and in a great majority 
 of cases we find them laboring under some derangement 
 of the digestive function, the restoration of which allays 
 the owners' apprehensions about lampas. The reader, 
 if he still considers that "something must be done for 
 lampas," may, possibly, change his opinion on perusing 
 the following from the pen of Mr. Percivall : — 

" Lampas is a name given by writers on farriery to a 
 swelling, or unnatural prominence, of some of the lowest 
 ridges or bars of the palate. I should not have thought 
 it worth while to have taken up time with this supposed 
 malady, but that it has called forth the infliction of great 
 torture on the animal by way of remedy, and that it has 
 been a cloak for the practice of much imposition on 
 those who have been in the habit of consulting farriers 
 on the diseases of their horses. I allude to the cruelty 
 and barbarity of burning the palates of horses so affected: 
 equally consistent would it be, and were it consistent, 
 more requisite, to cauterize the palates of children who 
 are teething ; for the truth is, the palate has no more to 
 do with the existing disease (if disease it can be called) 
 than the tail has. Lampas is neither more nor less than 
 a turgidity of the vessels of the palate, consequent upon 
 that inflammatory condition of the gums which now and 
 then attends the teething process ; but notwithstanding 
 this plain and simple truth, the horse continues to be 
 persecuted for it, even by some professional men, as well 
 as farriers. The practice is a stigma upon our national 
 character, and a disgrace to the professors of veterinary 
 science. 

" Teething in children is now and then a season at- 
 tended with restlessness and pain, and was one, before 
 surgeons were in the habit of using the gum lancet, of 
 anxiety and danger ; but it is not so with horses ; they 
 never have any feverish irritation created in the system, 
 though they may have some tenderness of the gums and 
 palate, and though some few, in consequence of this ten- 
 derness, cud their food, or refuse to eat any but what is 
 soft and unirritating. In such a case, if any thing re- 
 quires to be done, we ought to lance the gums, not the 
 palate ; but I do not remember ever to have had to do 
 this but once ; and this happened in the case of a horse, 
 then in his fifth year, which had fed so sparingly for the 
 last fortnight, and so rapidly declined in condition in 
 consequence of it, that his owner, a veterinary surgeon, 
 was under no slight apprehensions about his life. He 
 had himself repeatedly examined the horse's moutfij^ 
 without having discovered any defect or disease ; but 
 another veterinary surgeon, to whom he had shown the 
 animal, was of opinion that the averseness or inability 
 manifested in masticating food, and the consequent cud- 
 ding of most of that taken in, arose from a preternatural 
 bluntness of the faces of the grinders : these teeth, 
 therefore, were filed, but no benefit resulted. It was 
 after this that I saw the horse, and must confess that I 
 was just as much at a loss, in my first examination, to 
 offer any thing satisfactory on the case as many others
