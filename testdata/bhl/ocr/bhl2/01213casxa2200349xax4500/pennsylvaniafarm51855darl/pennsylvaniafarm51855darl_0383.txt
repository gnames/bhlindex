Bides. A succession of cold nights will prevent the eva- 
 poration of this moisture ; and this process of freezing 
 and thawing, at the end of a week or two, will form ici- 
 cles sometimes as large as a man's finger, attached to 
 the combs and the sides of the hive. When the bottom 
 of the hive is close to the floor, it forms a sealing around 
 the edges, perfectly air-tight, Hd your bees are smoth- 
 ered. I have frequently heard bee-keepers say in these 
 cases, "The storm blew in, and formed ice all around 
 the bottom, and froze my bees to death." Others that 
 have had their bees in a cold room, finding them thus, 
 "could not see how the water and ice could get there 
 any way ; were quite sure it was not there when carried 
 in," &c. Probably they never dreamed of its being ac- 
 counted for philosophically, and to analyze any thing 
 pertaining to bees would be rather small business. But 
 what way can it be accounted for ? 

Frost and Ice in a Hive Accounted for. — Physiolo- 
 gists tell us " that inumerable pores in the cuticle of the 
 human body are continually throwing off waste or worn 
 out matter ; that every exhalation of air carries with it 
 a portion of water from the system, in warm weather 
 unperceived, but will be condensed into particles large 
 enough to be seen in a cold atmosphere." Now, if anal- 
 ogy be allowed here, we will say the bee throws off waste 
 matter and water in the same way. Its food being 
 liquid, nearly all -will be exhaled — in moderate weather 
 it will pass off, but in the cold it is condensed — the par- 
 ticles lodge on the combs in form of frost, and accumu- 
 late as long as the weather is very severe, a portion 
 melting in the day, and freezing again at night. 

The Effect of Ice or Frost on Bees and Comb. — 
 When the bees are not smothered, this water in the hive 
 is the source of other mischief. The combs are quite 
 certain to mould. The water mould or dampness on the 
 honey renders it thin, and unhealthy for the bees, caus- 
 ing dysentery, or the accumulation of faeces that they 
 are unable to retain. When the hive contains a very 
 large family, or a very small one, there will be less frost 
 on the combs, — the animal heat of the first will drive it 
 off ; in the latter there will be but little exhaled. 

Frost mat cause Starvation.— This frost is fre- 
 quently the cause of medium or small families starving 
 in cold weather, even when there is plenty of honey in 
 the hive. Suppose all the honey in the immediate vicin- 
 ity of the cluster of bees is exhausted, and the combs in 
 every direction from them are covered with frost ; if a 
 bee should leave the mass and venture among them for 
 a supply, its fate would be as certain as starvation. 
 And without timely intervention of warmer weather, 
 they must perish ! 

Other Difficulties. — Should they escape starving, 
 there is another difficulty often attending them in con- 
 tinued cold weather. I said that small families exhaled 
 but little. Let us see if we can explain the effect. 

There is not sufficient animal heat generated to exhale 
 the aqueous portion of their food. The philosophy that 
 explains why a man in warm blood and in profuse per- 
 spiration would throw off or exhale more moisture than 
 in a quiet state, will illustrate this. The bees in these 
 circumstances must retain the water with the excremen- 
 titious part, which soon distends their bodies to the ut- 
 most, rendering them unable to endure it long. Their 

cleanly habits, that ordinarily save the combs from being 
 soiled, is not a sure protection now, and they are com- 
 pelled to leave the mass very often in the severest 
 weather, to expel this unnatural accumulation of faeces. 
 It is frequently discharged even before leaving the comb, 
 but most of it at the entrance ; also some scattered on 
 the front side of the hive, and a short distance from it. 
 In a moderately warm day, more bees will issue from a 
 hive in this condition than from others ; it appears that 
 a part of them are unable to discharge their burden — 
 their weight prevents their flying — they get down and 
 are lost. When cold weather is too long continued, they 
 cannot wait for warm days to leave, but continue to 
 come out at any time ; and not one of such can then 
 return. The cluster inside the hive is thus reduced in 
 numbers till they are unable to generate heat sufficient 
 to keep from freezing. — Mysteries of Bee-Keeping Ex-

Hoof Bound. 

The following are the directions of Dr. Dadd for this 
 disease : 

"In all cases we must endeavor to give the frog a 
 bearing on the ground ; and in order to do this the shoe 
 ought to be removed. A dry, brittle, and contracted 
 hoof may be improved by repeated poulticing with soft 
 soap and rye meal, applied cold. So soon as the hoof 
 softens, let it be dressed, night and morning, with tur- 
 pentine, linseed cil, and powdered charcoal, equal parts. 
 Yet, after all, a run at grass in a soft pasture, the ani- 
 mal having nothing more than tips on his feet, is the 
 best treatment. A very popular notion exists, that cow 
 manure has a wonderful effect on a contracted hoof; but 
 it is the candid opinion of the author, and no doubt the 
 reader will coincide, that filth and dirt of every kind are 
 unfavorable to healthy action. Such remedy, aside from 
 its objection on the score of decency, savors too much of 
 by-gone days, when live eels were sent on an errand 
 down horse's throats to unravel their intestines. If any 
 benefit belongs to such an objectionable application, it is 
 due to the property it possesses of retaining moisture ; 
 therefore cold poultices and water are far superior. 
 Clay and moist earth, placed in the stall for the horse to 
 stand on, are far inferior to a stuffing of wet oakum, 
 which can be removed at pleasure. In order to keep it 
 in contact with the sole, we have only to insinuate two 
 strips of wood between the sole and shoe ; one running 
 lengthwise and the other crosswise of the foot. It 
 affords considerable pressure to the foot, is cooling and 
 cleanly, and is far superior to the above articles." 

Drying Pumpkins and Making Pies. 
 Cut them and stew them till they are soft and dry ; 
 pound and strain them through a cullender; then grease 
 pie pans and spread it on a quarter of an inch thick and' 
 dry it ; roll it up, and put it away in a tight box or bag, 
 from the insects. Each one of these rolls will make a 
 pie. It is very easy now to make a pie. Put it in 
 sweet milk, and let it soak about two hours ; put in au 
 egg, a table-spoonful of sugar, a tea-spoonful of ginger, 
 and one of allspice ; and if you are lovers of pumpkin 
 pie, as we are, you will pronounce it good. — Ohio
