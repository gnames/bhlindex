Preparing Poultry for Market. 
 [The following article on this important subject will 
 constitute a chapter in the forthcoming new and improved 
 edition of the "American Poulterers' Companion," by 
 C. N. Bement, to be published by Harper & Brothers 
 of New York :] 

If you wish to prepare your poultry in the nicest 
 manner for the market, so that it will invariably secure 
 the best price, observe the following rules, viz : 

First, fat them well, and allow them to remain in the 
 pens twenty-four hours without food, previous to being 
 killed. Then, when you kill them, instead of wringing 
 their necks, cut their heads off at a single blow with a 
 sharp axe or hatchet, hang them up by their legs and 
 allow them to bleed, and pick them immediately — pick- 
 ing off their wing feathers, as well as the otheis, while 
 warm. Some, however, prefer to run a small penknife 
 into the jugular vein by the side of the neck, just under 
 the jowls. In this case let the heads remain on ; pick 
 them as above mentioned ; in picking, great care should 
 be taken not to tear the skin ; the wings should not be 
 cut off, but picked to the end. If the head should be 
 cut off, the skin of the neck should be neatly tied over 
 the end. Most people like to see the heads of fowls left 
 on — it makes a better show. The heads of ducks and 
 geese should be cut off. No cut should be made in the 
 breast, all the offal should be taken out behind, and the 
 opening should be made as small as possible. 

Some persons send them to market with their intes- 
 tines in. This, to say the least, is a dirty, slovenly 
 practice, doing great injury to the flesh, as it partakes 
 of the flavor of the excrements when suffered long to 
 remain undressed, and is otherwise impaired from the 
 stagnant blood. After removing the intestines, wipe out 
 the blood with a dry cloth, but no water should be used 
 to cleanse them. With a moist cloth take off the blood 
 that may be found upon the carcass, and hang them 
 up in a cool, dry room, until ready to carry to market, 
 or otherwise to be used. Do not remove the gizzard 
 from its place, but if the fowl be very fat, make a larger 
 hole, turn the leaves out, and fasten them with a small 
 skewer. When prepared in this way, your poultry will 
 be much nicer, and entitled to better prices than when 
 butchered and dressed in the ordinary way. 

We have often noticed the careless, slovenly manner, 
 and little attention paid to the external appearance of 
 poultry offered for sale in our markets ; and we have 
 also noticed the rapid sale and higher price where due 
 regard was paid to have the skin all sound and clean ; 
 the breast not mutilated by a long cut, the shrinking 
 skin exposing the drying meat covered with hay-seed or 
 chaff, but well covered all over with fat, of a rich golden 
 yellow. Much of ihe poultry exposed for sale has been 
 through the pr^ess of scalding to facilitate picking ; 
 this practice should never be resorted to. It turns the 
 rich yellow of the fat into a tallowy hue, and oftentimes 
 starts the skin, so that it peels off, unless carefully 
 handled. 

Much care and attention is required after the poultry 
 is dressed and cool. It should be carefully packed in 
 baskets or boxes, and above all, it should be kept from 
 the frost. A friend, who was very nice in these matters, 
 used to bring his turkies to market in the finest possible 

order, and always obtained a ready sale and the highest 
 price. His method was to pick them dry, while warm, 
 and dress them in the neatest manner ; then take a long, 
 deep, narrow, tight box, with a stick running from end 
 to end of the box, and hanging the turkeys by the leg 
 over the stick, which prevents bruising or disfiguring 
 them in the least. • 

Too much should not be exposed at a time for sale, 
 nor should they be hauled over too often. Appearance 
 is every thing with poultry, as well as other articles, and 
 has great influence on the purchaser. 

"To preserve poultry in winter," said the late Judge 
 Bxiel, "about the 15th of November I purchased a 
 quantity of poultry for winter use. The insides were 
 carefully drawn, their place partially filled with charcoal, 
 and the poulti-y hung in an airy loft. It was used 
 through the winter, till about the first of February, and 
 although some was kept seventy days, it was not the 
 least affected with moist or taint, the charcoal keeping it 
 sweet." — Rural New Yorker. 

The Wyandot Corn. 

I planted a number of grains of this corn on the 23d 
 of May. It exceeds my expectation, as I feared it was 
 a "Multi Caullus" concern, but it is not so. 

The germinative production is from two to seven 
 stalks, from nine to fourteen feet high, each stalk having 
 its own separate spur roots, and each stalk yielding from 
 one to three ears, but generally two ears, from one grain 
 planted ; the ears have from twelve to fourteen rows of 
 a pearly white color, the ear from eight to eleven inches 
 long, and being near the size of the common red cob- 
 gourd seed variety, though the grain is not so long or 
 deep. The ears grow on the stalk as on other corn, but 
 not on the top as on suckers of other varieties do. 

There is no doubt but it will yield more corn, and 
 more fodder, than any other variety of maize now culti- 
 vated, and if sown broad cast would yield much food for 
 stock cattle of any kind. 

I don't pretend to say that this, or any other vegeta- 
 ble, will grow in any sort of soil, as it is well known 
 that the soil should contain or be composed of several 
 peculiar composing parts of vegetable matter and nutri- 
 ment ; this, with proper culture, will seldom disappoint 
 the farmer. 

I received my seed corn from a gentleman, Mr. Thomas, 
 of Illinois, who obtained it from a Wyandot Indian. 

I planted one grain in each hill, four feet apart each 
 way. The yield is satisfactory. I paid at the rate of $1 
 per hundred grains, and will have several thousand 
 grains to dispose of at the same price, or at what others 
 sell, after the first of next month, though much of it is 
 engaged ; those who send in their orders for it first will 
 be served first. 

I may also say that I will warrant it pure, and not 
 adulterated or mixed in any way with other corn, and 
 that I have no reason to think that it would require 
 more time or longer season to mature than other corn. 

Many gentlemen have been to see this corn (now on 
 the stalk) from different parts of the country.
