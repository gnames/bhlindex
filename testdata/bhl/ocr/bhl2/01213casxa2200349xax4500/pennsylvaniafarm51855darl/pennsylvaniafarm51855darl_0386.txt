It is found in practice, as the above table shows, that 
 twenty stones of potatoes, or three of oil-cake, will 
 nourish an animal as much as ten stones of hay will, 
 and five stones of oats as much as either. Something, 
 however, will depend upon the quality of the sample of 
 each kind of food used — which we know varies very 
 much, and with numerous circumstances; and something 
 also upon the age and constitution of the animal, and 
 upon the way and form in which the food is administered. 
 The skilful rearer, feeder, and fattener of stock knows 
 also the value of a change of food, or of a mixture of the 
 different kinds of vegetable food he may have at his 
 command. 

2. The generally nutritive value of different kinds of 
 food has also been represented theoretically, by supposing 
 it to be very nearly in proportion to the quantity of ni- 
 trogen, or of gluten, which vegetables contain. Though 
 this cannot be considered as a correct principle, yet as 
 the ordinary kinds of food on which stock is fed contain 
 in general an ample supply of carbon for respiration, 
 with a comparatively small proportion of nitrogen, these 
 theoretical determinations are by no means without their 
 value, and they approach, in many cases, very closely to 
 the practical values above given, as deduced from actual 
 trial. Thus assuming that 10 lb. of hay yield a certain 
 amount of nourishment, then of the other vegetable sub- 
 stances it will be necessary, according to theory, to give 
 the following quantities, in order to produce the same 
 general effect in feeding : — 

If the feeder be careful to supply his stock with a 
 mixture or occasional change of food — and especially, 
 where necessary, with a proper proportion of fatty mat- 
 ter — he may very safely regulate, by the numbers in the 
 above tables, the quantity of any one which he ought to 
 substitute for a given weight of any of the others — 
 since the theoretical and practical results do not in gen- 
 eral very greatly differ. 

3. As has been already stated, however, it is not 
 strictly correct that this or that kind of vegetable is 
 more fitted to sustain animal life, simply because of the 
 large proportion of nitrogen or gluten it contains ; but 
 it is wisely provided that, along with this nitrogen, all 
 plants contain a certain proportion of starch or sugar, 

and of saline and earthy matter — all of which, as we 
 have seen, are required in a mixture which will most 
 easily sustain an animal in a healthy condition ; so that 
 the proportion of nitrogen in a substance may be con- 
 sidered as a rough practical index of the proportion of 
 the more important saline and earthy ingredients also. 

4. It is very doubtful, however, how far this propor- 
 tion of nitrogen can be regarded as any index of the fat- 
 tening property of vegetable substances. If the fat in 
 the body be produced from the oil in the food, it is 
 certain that the proportion of this oil in vegetable sub- 
 stances is by no means regulated by that of the gluten 
 or other analogous substances containing nitrogen. The 
 stock farmer who wishes to lay on fat only upon his ani- 
 mals, must therefore be regulated by another principle. 
 He must select those kinds of food, such as linseed and 
 oil-cake, in which fatty matters appear to abound, or 
 mix a due proportion of fat or oil with the Other kinds 
 of food he employs. 

But large quantities of fat accumulate in the bodies of 
 most animals, only when they are in an unnatural, and, 
 perhaps in some measure, an unhealthy condition. In a 
 state of nature there are comparatively few animals 
 upon which large accumulations of fat take place. A 
 certain portion, as we have seen, is necessary to the 
 healthy animal ; but it is an interesting fact, that as 
 much as is necessary to supply this, is present in most 
 kinds of vegetable food. In wheaten flour it is asso- 
 ciated with the gluten, and may be extracted from it 
 after the starch of the flour has been separated from the 
 gluten by washing with water. In so far, therefore, as 
 this comparatively small necessary quantity of fatty 
 matter is concerned, the proportion of nitrogen may also 
 be taken, without the risk of any serious error, as a 
 practical indication of the ability of the food to supply 
 the natural waste of fat in an animal which is either 
 growing in general size only, or is only to be maintained 
 in its existing condition. 

While, therefore, it appears from the study of the 
 principles upon which the feeding of animals depends, 
 that a mixture of various principles is necessary in a 
 nutritive food, it is interesting to find that all kinds of 
 vegetable food which are raised, either by art or by na- 
 tural growth, are in reality such mixtures of these sev- 
 eral substances — more or less adapted to fulfil all the 
 conditions required from a nutritious diet, according to 
 the state of health and growth in which the animal to 
 be fed may happen to be. 

An important practical lesson on this subject, there- 
 fore, is taught us by the study of the wise provisions of 
 nature. Not only does the milk of the mother contain 
 all the elements of a nutritive food mixed up together — 
 as the egg does also for the unhatched bird — but in rich 
 natural pastures the same mixture uniformly occurs. 
 Hence, in cropping the mixed herbage, the animal intro- 
 duces into its stomach portions of various plants — some 
 abounding more in starch or sugar, some more in gluten 
 or albumen — some more in fatty matter — while some are 
 naturally richer in saline, others in earthy constituents ; 
 and out of these varied materials the digestive organs 
 select a due proportion of each and reject the rest. 
 Wherever a pasture becomes usurped by one or two 
 grasses — either animals cease to thrive upon it, or they
