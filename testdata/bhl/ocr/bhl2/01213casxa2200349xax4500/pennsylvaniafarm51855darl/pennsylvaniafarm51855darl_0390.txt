Fall Treatment of Trees. 

Mr. Freas : — Many who attempt the cultivation of fruit 
 and ornamental trees, fail from not paying sufficient atten- 
 tion to them in the fall. Tho fall of the leaf is often a criti- 
 cal time with most trees, and they consequently require 
 more at'ention than at other times. Trees that have been 
 recently set, and which have not had time to radicate, or 
 send out vigorous laterals for their support, generally receive 
 considerable injury from the autumn winds, the swaying to 
 which they are exposed, causing a laceration of the radicals 
 which not unfrequently operates fatally, and is always to a 
 greater or less extent injurious even where the effect is not 
 clearly apparent. All trees should be secured from this evil 
 by stakes fixed in the soil, as soon as they are set out. This 
 precaution will often be the means of saving much expense, 
 and the loss of many valuable trees. In the spring, as soon 
 as the frost is fairly out of the soil, the sward should be re- 
 moved, and manure dug in around the roots. Compost, 
 formed of forest scrapings, stable manure, chip manure, 
 wood ashes, old lime and gypsum, constitutes a most excel- 
 lent stimulant for young trees. In setting apple trees, I have 
 found that a few quarts of lime, deposited in the holes be- 

fore the trees are placed in position, causes a rapid and vig- 
 orous start, and secures a healthy development through tho 
 subsequent periods ef growth. After filling in, which should 
 be done with great care, I generally, in the case of young 
 trees, cover the surface with spent tan, fine chips, saw-dust, 
 or straw. A good mulching article for plum trees, is found 
 in salt hay, the invigorating and sanatory effects of which, 
 upon most species of the plum, which is of marine origin, is 
 remarkable. When it cannot be easily obtained, ordinary 
 fresh hay, wet with a solution of salt, may be used as a sub- 
 stitute. But of all articles used, chip manure, when fine, is 
 probably the most valuable ; it lasts for a long period, acts 
 as an efficient non-conductor, keeping the soil moist and 
 warm, and prevents the growth of weeds. As it decomposes, 
 it supplies a healthful and invigorating pabulum to the roots, 
 and restores to the soil a portion of the alimentary matters 
 abstracted by the trees. Ornamental trees are rarely trans- 
 planted as they should be. The work is generally performed 
 by men who have no interest in the labor, and who, feeling 
 themselves perfectly irresponsible, are of course indifferent 
 as to the result. No work better repays extra care than that 
 of tree planting, whether pursued on a small or largo scale.

NEW PEARS THAT PROMISE WELL. 

We insert the accompanying cuts of five fine Pears which 
 have been introduced into this country to the attention of 
 Pomologists, chiefly through tho Hon. M. P. Wilder, to whom 
 the public are largely indebted for some of our finest fruits. 

Four of them, Dogenne, Goubault, Charles Van Horgten, 
 Beune Superfine, and have been passed upon by the last 
 American Pomological Convention, in Boston, as " varieties 
 that piomise well." The descriptions are by M. P. Wilder.
