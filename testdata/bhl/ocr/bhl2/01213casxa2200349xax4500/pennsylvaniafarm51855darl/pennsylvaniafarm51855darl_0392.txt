they contained alone. He did not know what gave leached 
 ashes their peculiar value. No matter if we do not, so long 
 as experience proves their value. We know, however, that 
 they contain some phosphates; and it is probable that old 
 leached ashes, that have been exposod to the atmosphere, 
 contain nitrogen, and would be valuable on that account. 
 He had seen guano used without any visible effect. He 
 mentioned several instances where salt had been applied to 
 land without any benefit. One gentleman who had manu- 
 factured salt, and had tried it on his land repeatedly, in- 
 formed him that he found the less he got on his soil the 
 better. 

L. Wetherell stated that a farmer in Hampshire county, 
 Mass., informed him that " no farmer could afford to move 
 his manure at all, as long as he could obtain guano at pres- 
 ent prices. Another farmer told him, that on poor land 
 where he could obtain nothing — not even "poverty grass," 
 by the uso of 300 lbs. of guano per acre he succeeded in 
 raising 30 bushels of wheat. Another gentleman had used 
 guano as a top-dressing on grass, and obtained good results, 
 but ever afterwards nothing would grow on the land. 

Hon. Geo. Geddes, of Syracuse, had long time ago given 
 up the idea that agriculture is an exact science. He had 
 tried salt to his satisfaction. He had staked out a rod of 
 land in each of three different fields, and carefully dressed 
 them with salt, and sowed them with barley, oats and wheat; 
 and he could never see the difference between them and 
 ■where no salt was applied. The President of the Onondaga 
 County Society called on him to visit a field of wheat, where 
 salt had been applied on a portion of it, and where, he said, 
 the exact line of demarkation could be distinctly perceived; 
 but his (Mr. Geddes',) eyes were not sharp enough to distin- 
 guish it. 

Hugh T. Brooks, of Wyoming, thought a good deal of 
 barn-yard manure. When we speak of barn-yard manure, 
 we use an indefinite term. It may mean something of great 
 value, or a comparatively worthless compound. He put a 
 good dressing of manure on his corn fields, and the census 
 man stated that it was the best corn he had seen. He, Mr. 
 B., thought that farmers should husband their manures, and 
 return all animal and vegetable refuse to the earth from 
 whence it came. 

Sanford Howard said there was a gentleman present who 
 bad had much experience in the use of guano and other con- 
 centrated fertilizers, and who had been for some years con- 
 nected with an extensive series of experiments in England, 
 and he would like to hear his opinion in regard to the sub- 
 jects under discussion. He referred to Joseph Harris, of the 
 Country Gentleman. 

Mr. Harris agreed with Mr. Robinson that Peruvian gu- 
 ano was the cheapest and the best concentrated fertilizer at 
 present in the market, for wheat, corn, and other cereals. 
 Mr. R. had not attempted to prove that "no farmer could 
 afford to draw manure one mile." He had simply endea- 
 vored to show that Peruvian guano, salt, Ac, were cheaper 
 sources of fertilizing .matter than barn-yard manure. The 
 question to be decided was the relative value of Peruvian 
 guano and barn-yard manure. Chemical analysis afforded 
 much light on the point. Peruvian guano contained all the 
 elements of barn-yard manure. The difference between 
 them is mainly in the relative proportion of these elements. 
 Barn-yard manure contained an immense amount of carbo- 
 naceous matter, silica, &c, while Peruvian guano contained 
 very little. But these substances were of little manurial 
 value. The most valuable ingredient in Peruvian guano 
 was ammonia, and we may take the quantity of this sub- 
 stance as indicating the relative value of the two manures. 
 Certainly this method would not underrate the ultimate 

value of barn-yard manure. Good Peruvian guano contains 
 twenty-five times as much amonia or nitrogen as good barn- 
 yard manure. According to this method of estimating their 
 relative manurial value, one ton of Peruvian guano was equal 
 to 25 tons of barn-yard manure. If Peruvian guano sells 
 for $50 per ton, barn-yard manure is worth $2 per ton. He 
 would have farmers to decide whether they could afford to 
 draw it one mile for this, or not. 

In reply to various questions asked by several gentlemen 
 present, Mr. H. said he had seen salt used as a manure in 
 many instances, and never once with any marked beneficial 
 effect. Nevertheless there were many well authenticated 
 experiments where it has produced a considerable increase 
 of the crop. It gave strength and brightness to the straw. 
 Prof. Way has suggested that salt acts beneficially on some 
 soils, by increasing the solubility of the double silicate of 
 alumina and ammonia, in which form he thinks it not im- 
 probable that the silica so largely existing in the straw of 
 wheat, and which enables it to stand erect, is taken up by 
 the plant. We have no existing system of rotation, by which 
 sodium and chlorino, — the elements of salt, — could be re- 
 moved from the soil, without, at the same time, removing 
 other elements of plants in greater proportion. Salt, there- 
 fore, cannot be used, to any great extent, as a manure. It can 
 never be a manure equal to phosphoric acid or ammonia, 
 inasmuch as a small quantity only is removed from the soil, 
 as compared with these and other substances. He, Mr. H., 
 was greatly in favor of Peruvian guano, yet its value might 
 be over estimated. In England, 3 cwt. of good Peruvian 
 guano gives an increase in the wheat crop of 10 bushels per 
 acre. At present prices this would cost $10, and it follows 
 that if wheat sells for $1 por bushel, little is gained by its 
 use; but if it sells for $2, the application of guano will be 
 quite profitable. Those who are continually holding up to 
 our imitation the high farming of England, appear to forget 
 that English farmers obtain a higher price for their produce. 
 He believed, that for the production of wheat, this climate 
 was superior to that of England, and that if he could obtain 
 English prices; — if he could obtain $3 per bushel for wheat, 
 he could annually raise 50 bushels per acre. 

Gen. Harmon, of Wheatland, thought this could not be 
 done, and offered to pay the gentleman $3 per bushel for 
 all the wheat he could raise in crops of 50 bushels per acre. 

Mr. Harris believed that this climate would enable him to 
 raise such crops if a sufficiency of mineral and ammoniacal 
 manures were supplied ; but had ho anticipated Gen. Har- 
 mon's proposition he would have said 40 bushels in order to 
 be within safe bounds. Last year, Mr. Lawes, of Rotham- 
 sted, England, produced 55 bushels of wheat per acre on 
 land that had grown 12 crops of wheat in 12 successive years. 
 This result was due in a great measure to the dryness of the 
 season. Had the same amount of fertilizing matter been 
 supplied in a wet year the crop would have been all straw. 
 A dry, hot season is what good English wheat growers de- 
 sire. The nearer their summer approximates to ours in rain 
 and temperature, the better their wheat crops. 

An animated discussion followed on the value of salt as 
 manure. Judge Cheever said he applied a quart of salt to 
 his plum trees and it killed every ono of them. L. Wetherell 
 thought salt was good for plum trees, and he had been in- 
 formed that it would cure the black knot. 

This was emphatically denied by many gentlemen present. 
 Salt had been repeatedly used for the black knot, and proved, 
 of no use. 

Mr. Osborn, of Watervliet, had used salt on his orch- 
 ard with the best result. It had an astonishing effect. 

Mr. Harris asked how Mr. Osborn knew that the salt
