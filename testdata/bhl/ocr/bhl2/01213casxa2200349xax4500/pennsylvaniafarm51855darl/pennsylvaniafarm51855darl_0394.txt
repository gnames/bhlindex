splendor in our eyes ; but in their stead you have shown us 
 troops of gallant steeds, stronger of sinew, fleeter of foot, 
 and lither of limb, than ever champed a bit or struck a hoof 
 in the Elian circle, and backed by toil-hardened men, who 
 live in the daily practice of a liberty beyond any of which 
 the Greek had over dreamed. It is true, sir, that within 
 your enclosures no naked wrestlers or sturdy athletes have 
 tortured their supple joints in degrading encounters ; but 
 better far than these, you have set before us whole droves of 
 cattle preeminently fitted for the dairy, the shambles, or the 
 yoke ; whole flocks of sheep, rich in the wool that gives 
 aetivity to our looms, and the flesh that ministers to the 
 healthy, and tempts even the sated appetite ; whole herds of 
 swine, suggestive of that abundance which, out of our sur- 
 plus, enables us to feed the hungry of the earth ; and all 
 these you have presented so cared for and provided, so pam- 
 pered and fattened, that, while on the one hand you have 
 avoided whatever might lower the condition of man, on the 
 other, for his use, and convenience, and enjoyment, you have 
 elevated the condition of the brute. And, Mr. President, if 
 in all things else this anniversary celebration of the United 
 States Agricultural Society had fallen short of the far-famed 
 celebrations of old : if, instead of surpassing them, as it has, 
 in all the manifestations of material superiority connected 
 with the multiplication of human comforts, it had failed 
 to match their meanest efforts ; if, instead of the invincible 
 demonstration of progress which every incident of the dis- 
 play has contributed to strengthen, there had been equally 
 unmistakeable proofs of stagnation or retrogression; there 
 is one thing in which it has gone so immeasurably before 
 them, that for that, and that alone, it would be a thousand 
 fold more entitled to our praise. Mr. President: the Greek, 
 with all his elegance and refinement; with all his philosophy 
 and learning; with all his exquisite appreciation of poetry, 
 and music, and painting, and sculpture, and 6tatuary, had 
 no adequate conception of the true value and just position 
 of woman, and admitted her to no participation, unless in 
 exceptional cases, in his higher pursuits and graver occupa- 
 tions. As part of his general system, she was prohibited, 
 on pain of death, from being prosent at the ceremonies of 
 the sacred island ; and the reservation in favor of tho free- 
 love priestesses of Ceres only attested more significantly the 
 dishonoring character of the exclusion. You, sir, have been 
 guided by a wiser and better spirit, and recognising that 
 social equality of the sexes, which reason and revelation 
 alike teach us, you have thrown your gates wide open to the 
 maids and matrons of the community, you have given them 
 due precedence as well in the spectacle as at the banquet, 
 and in the bright, the thoughtful, the eloquent faces which 
 at this moment turn towards me, I perceive the visible to- 
 kens of the illimitable advance which our Christian has 
 made over heathen civilization. 

Mr. President : In tho most glorious era of Grecian Art, 
 under the administration of the magnificent Pericles, the 
 wealth and power of that distinguished ststesman were di- 
 rected to the construction of such works, as being immortal 
 themselves, might confer immortality on their authors and 
 projectors. First among these in grandeur, in beauty, in 
 costliness, was the colossal statue of Jupiter by Phidias. 
 Towering in its pride of place in the temple on Mount 
 Olympus, gorgeous with gold, and ivory, and all manner of 
 precious stones, that transcendant result of genius drew to 
 it all the visitors of the Olympic games, who offered their 
 devotion rather to tho conscious presence of a divino art 
 than to the imaged incarnation of the potent Thunderer, 
 which sat in cold and stately majesty before them. Sir : 

nearly fourteen centuries have rolled by since that statue 

the faith it typified having long before perished — was buried 

beneath its own smouldering embers at Constantinople, then 
 the brilliant seat of the Imperial Ceesars. And not alone 
 have the faith and its emblem perished. The classic travel- 
 ler gropes in vain among the obliterated landmarks of An- 
 tilla for traces of the Hippodrome, or vestiges of the Pry- 
 taneum. Constantinople, smitten with the plague spot of a 
 corrupt religion, and emaciated by the long exhaustion of a 
 feeble dynasty, writhes in the death grasp of inevitable dis- 
 solution. The Greek himself, enervated alike in language 
 and in spirit, resembles his fathers only in name. But, Mr. 
 President, on a new continent, under a new dispensation, 
 and a new polity — professors of a purer creed, possessors of 
 a surer heritage — we havo to-day commemorated a new 
 Olympiad. From all parts of a republic, mightier in its in- 
 fancy than Athens in its prime, there have crowded earnest 
 candidates for the honors, valiant stragglers for the prizes 
 you have had to bestow. Nor have the statue and the tem- 
 ple been wanting. Beneath the dome of your capitol, we 
 have marked the placid dignity of our Pater Patrias, whose 
 deeds and whose virtues shall survive in the affections of 
 distant generations, when the old mythology, father God 
 and all, with all its vanities and vices, has sunk into utter 
 oblivion. From the foot of a neighboring eminence, we 
 have gazed on the simple column which crowns the spot 
 consecrated by the blood of the primitive martyrs of Amer- 
 ican freedom — a column which, simple though it be, is dear- 
 er in the associations which cluster around it than any hoary 
 pile, no matter how venerable in its antiquity, nobler than 
 any modern trophy, 

"Built with the riches of a spoiled world." 

And, Mr. Presidont, whatever of pride the cultivated 
 Greek may have felt in contemplating the master-piece of 
 Grecian skill, — whatever of reverence the pious Greek may 
 have felt in contemplating the master-deity of the Grecian 
 Pantheon, — we who are now assembled from the north and 
 the south, from the east and the west, have felt a loftier 
 pride, a holier reverence, than ever Olympian statue or 
 Olympian temple inspired, as, filled with solemn memories 
 of the past and jubilant hopes of the future, we have stood 
 before the marbled form of our own Washington, or besides 
 the granite monument that records the story of Bunker Hill.

Relative Proportions of Food for Man Yielded by the 
 same Herbage in the Forms of Beef and Milk. 

A curious economical question, in connection with the 
 value of vegetable produce in feeding cattle, presents 
 itself to us when we come to compare the proportions of 
 human food which may be obtained from the same weight 
 of herbage when cattle are fed with it for different im- 
 mediate purposes. 

A ton of hay may be given to a bullock to be converted 
 into beef. Another ton of the same hay may be given 
 to a cow to be converted into milk. Would the beef or 
 the milk produced contain the larger supply of food for 
 man ? We have rather imperfect data to rely upon in 
 answering this question, but they lead us to very inter- 
 esting results. 

1. According to Sir John Sinclair, the same herbage 
 which will add 112 lb. to the weight of an ox, will enable 
 a cow to yield 450 wine gallons, or 3600 lb. of milk. 
 This milk will contain 160 lb. of dry curd, 160 lb. of 
 butter, 180 lb. of sugar, and 18 lb. of saline matter, 
 while the 112 lb. of beef will not contain more than 25 
 or 30 lb. of dry muscle, fat, and saline matter together; 
 that is to say, the same weight of herbage which will 
 produce less than 30 lb. of dry human food in the form 
 of beef will yield 500 lb. in the form of milk.
