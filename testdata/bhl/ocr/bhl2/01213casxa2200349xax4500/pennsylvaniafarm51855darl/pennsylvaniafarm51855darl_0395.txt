2. But this statement of Sir John Sinclair's is, I fear, 
 not to be relied upon. We have another, however, 
 somewhat different, from Riedesel, a Continental author- 
 ity. He says that the same quantity of hay will produce 
 either 100 lb. of beef, or 100 imperial gallons (1000 lb.) 
 of milk. This quantity of milk contains only 150 lb. of 
 dry food, but it is still five times as much as is contained 
 in the beef. 

This statement of Riedesel is also to be received with 
 hesitation; but the subject is interesting and important, 
 as well as curious, and is deserving of further investiga- 
 tion. Should the population of the country ever become 
 BO dense as to render a rigorous economy of food a na- 
 tional question, butcher-meat, if the above data deserve 
 any reliance, will be banished from our tables, and a 
 milk diet will be the daily sustenance of almost all classes 
 of society. 

Influence of Circumstances in Modifying the 
 Practical Values of Animal and Vegetable Food. — 
 The indications of theory and the results of general 
 practice, in regard to the nutritive power of different 
 vegetable substances, are modified by many circum- 
 stances which ought to be borne in mind. Whether fed 
 for work, or for the production of flesh or milk, the 
 effect of the food given to animals will depend partly on 
 the kind, breed, and constitution of the animal itself — 
 on the general treatment to which it is subjected, and 
 the place in which it is kept — on its size and state of 
 health — and on the form in which the food itself is given. 

1. The breed or constitution, every feeder knows, has a 
 great influence on the apparent value of food. Some 
 breeds, like the improved Short-Horn, have a natural 
 tendency to fatten, which makes them increase in weight 
 more rapidly than other breeds, when fed upon the same 
 food. And even in the same breed, the rapidity with 
 which one animal lays on flesh will sometimes make it 
 two or three times more profitable to the farmer than 
 othei'S which are fed along with it. 

2. Warmth and shelter cause the same amount of food 
 to go farther, as do also gentle treatment and the ab- 
 sence of glaring light. Sheep have produced double the 
 weight of mutton from the same weight of vegetable 
 food, when fed under shelter, and kept undisturbed and 
 in the dark. It is probably from this beneficial influ- 
 ence of warmth that, in the North American States, a 
 difference of 25 per cent, is observed in favor of the 
 spring and summer over the winter feeding of the pigs 
 upon similar food. 

3. The form in ivhich the food is given is of no less im- 
 portance. Grass newly cut goes farther than after it is 
 made into hay ; and the opinion is new becoming very 
 prevalent, that steamed, boiled, or otherwise prepared 
 food, is more wholesome for cattle, and more economical 
 to the feeder, than the same food given in a dry state. 

In the case of horses, the difference between the prac- 
 tice of giving all the food dry and uncut, and that of 
 giving all the hay cut with the oats and beans crushed, 
 and an evening meal of steamed food, is such as to effect 
 a saving of nearly one-third. Thus, the same wagon 
 horses which consumed 3 J bushels of oats per week, and 
 14 stones of hay, when given uncut, uncrushed, and 
 uncooked, were kept in good condition by 2J bushels of 
 oats, 8 stone3 of hay, and 7 lb. of linseed when the 

grain was crushed, the hay cut into half inch chaff, and 
 the linseed with a little bean-meal and cut hay made into 
 a steamed meal-feed in the evening. 

4. The malting and sprouting of barley is by many 
 practical men considered to increase its nutritive quali- 
 ties. It is certain that, when mixed with boiled potatoes 
 to the extent of three or four per cent., and kept warm 
 for a few hours, bruised malt produces a prepared food 
 which is much relished by milch cows, and is profitable 
 to the dairyman. There is reason to believe that similar 
 mixtures with other kinds of food would produce similar 
 beneficial effects. 

Mr. Hudson, of Castle Acre, feeds his farm horses on 
 12 lb. of sprouted barley a day, besides their fodder ; 
 and this, on his light land, keeps them in good condition. 
 It is prepared by steeping the barley for 24 hours, and 
 then putting it into a heap and turning it over for five 
 days. 

5. The souring of food of all kinds has, by almost uni- 
 versal consent, been found to make it more profitable in 
 the feeding and fattening of pigs. It makes them fatten 
 faster, and gives a firmer and whiter flesh. 

Many other circumstances also modify the real prac- 
 tical value of food, and cause it to produce results differ- 
 ent from those indicated by its chemical composition. 
 But to those, want of space does not permit me here to 
 advert. — Johnson's Ag. Chemistry. 

The New Jersey State Fair. 

The crowded state of our columns last month, in con- 
 sequence of the publication of the entire reports of the 
 Committees of the Pennsylvania State Exhibition, pre- 
 vented us from noticing, as we had fully intended, the 
 exhibition of the New Jersey State Society. As a first 
 effort, it was certainly most creditable, and argued well 
 for the future success of the Society. When we look 
 back to the early exhibitions of our own and other State 
 Societies, we have good grounds for congratulating our 
 neighbors on the other side of the Delaware. 

The arrangement of the grounds was such as to make 
 them most inviting in appearance. A very large part of 
 the enclosure was shaded with fine trees, rendering it 
 much more pleasant to visitors than fair grounds usually 
 are. 

The attendance of visitors was large, and would have 
 been greater, but for the unpromising appearance of the 
 weather in the early part of the week. 

From the well known character of New Jersey farmers 
 in regard to the growing of superior vegetables, we were 
 led to expect a very superior display in that department. 
 In this, however, we were somewhat disappointed. The 
 vegetables exhibited were remarkably fine, but not in 
 such quantities as we know could have been brought 
 forward with a very little effort. Another season will 
 remedy this error. 

Of horses, the display was very superior — better we 
 think than any other department of the exhibition, and 
 decidedly better than that of our own State. Good 
 horses are characteristic of New Jersey. There is a 
 decided taste for the improvement of these noble animals 
 in the State, and the devotion of the visitors in this 
 direction was evidenced by the marked attractions which 
 the horse ring had for the large majority. In fact,
