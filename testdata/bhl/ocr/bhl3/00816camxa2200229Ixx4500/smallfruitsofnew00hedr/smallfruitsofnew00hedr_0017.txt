PREFACE 

The Small Fruits of New York is the seventh of the monographs on 
 fruits pubUshed by the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station. 
 The object and scope of this treatise on small fruits do not differ from those 
 of its six predecessors on tree fruits. The treatment of the subject is 
 necessarily different, however, for it has required a volume each to give 
 an account of the tree fruits, whereas one volume suffices for the six quite 
 distinct small fruits. The most noticeable difference in treatment is that 
 cultural accounts are not given of any of these small fruits, whereas the 
 present culture of each of the tree fruits was discussed in the several books 
 devoted to them. To give space to tell how each of the small fruits are 
 grown would have made the volume too large, valuable though such matter 
 might be both from practical and historical viewpoints. 

The botanical treatment of the small fruits is fuller than was possible 
 â– with the tree fruits. The authors of the books on tree fruits were all 
 primarily pomologists with little training in systematic botany. The botany 
 of the several fruits as given in the earlier books, especially of the grape 
 and the plum, presented problems that were not satisfactorily solved. The 
 botany of the small fruits is difficult at best, and none of the workers in 
 pomology at this Station are fitted to make contributions worth publishing. 
 The services of a specialist in systematic botany were therefore sought, and 
 the Station was fortunate in obtaining Alwin Berger, a German student 
 of Rubus, to undertake the difficult task of straightening out the botany of 
 cvdtivated strawberries, bramble, and bush fruits. Even so, only a pre- 
 liminary report on Rubus is published, since neither time nor material 
 sufficed to complete the study of this most difficult genus. 

The fruits to be discussed are the raspberry, blackberry, dewberry, 
 currant, gooseberry, and strawberry. The cranberry is important enough 
 for a place in the book, but this fruit cannot be grown on the grounds of 
 this Station, or in the near neighborhood, so that there is small opportunity 
 for its study. Nor, for the same reason, can there be a discussion of the 
 blueberry, which is now coming into culture with promise of commercial 
 importance in the near future. It is regretable that these fruits cannot be 
 included at a time when the culture of the one is but well started and that 
 of the other just beginning.
