vi PREFACE 

As with the tree fruits, the aim is to make The Small Fruits of New York 
 a complete record of the development of each fruit, not only as cultivated 
 in New York and the United States, but to some extent in foreign countries 
 as well. As complete a history as possible, both from the botanical and 
 cultural viewpoints, is necessary to show clearly the present and the future 
 of these frtdts for the ciiltivator and the consvmier. However, much less 
 need be said about foreign varieties of these small fruits than was written 
 about exotic tree fruits, since only varieties of the several fruits which have 
 originated on the continent, with a few exceptions in currants and goose- 
 berries, have much value in America. 

The considerations which have governed the selection of varieties for 
 full description and illustration in this book are somewhat different from 
 those which prevailed in the preparation of the books on tree fruits. Small 
 fruits are newer to cultivation than tree fruits, evolution with them is now 
 in full swing, and varieties are much shorter lived. Therefore it has seemed 
 necessary to give greater prominence to types which show the trend of 
 evolution, some of which may have little value for culture at the present 
 time. Besides these types, varieties valuable for home or market, new 
 varieties of note, and all of the small fruits which have proved their worth 
 in breeding, are given prominence in illustration and description. 

As in the preceding fruit books, the references given for species and 
 varieties are those that have been used in ascertaining the history and 
 economic status, or in verifying the description, of the different groups. The 
 synonyms created by pomologists whose works have been consulted are 
 given, but in no case are synonyms given when quoted by one pomologist 
 or botanist from another. It is one of the chief aims of The Small Fruits of 
 New York to make certain the correct names of the species and varieties 
 described, often, however, a difficult and uncertain task. 

The biographical sketches of men who have been most prominent in 
 breeding, introducing, establishing methods of culture, and describing and 
 classifying small fruits are to be found in footnotes. A knowledge of the 
 lives and work of these men helps materially in following the evolution of 
 the several fruits and of the small fruit industries in the New World.
