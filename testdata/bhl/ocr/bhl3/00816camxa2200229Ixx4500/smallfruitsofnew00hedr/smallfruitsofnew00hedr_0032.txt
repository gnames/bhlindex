8 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

" This fruit was originally discovered by the Greeks growing on 
 Mount Ida, whence the specific name Idaeiis. At present we have not 
 only many varieties of the above, but several other species, which are 
 cviltivated for their fruit in our gardens: among which the Common Red, 
 which is sent to our markets in immense quantities, and is largely used 
 in the making of raspberry brandy; is of fine flavour and much esteemed, 
 and is the most productive; also the White and the Red Antwerp, which are 
 of very large size and high flavour — of these the White is generally pre- 
 ferred - — they are both productive and excellent fruits. The American 
 White and American Black are inferior in flavour, but are nevertheless 
 esteemed by many persons, particularly the white variety. The Twice 
 Bearing, if properly managed, is quite an acquisition. In general, they pro- 
 duce one crop at the usual period, and a less one late in the season, but as 
 a full crop is most desirable, it is said to be best to cut off the whole of the 
 stalks quite to the ground early in the spring, in order to force a strong 
 growth of young wood, which will yield a large quantity of fruit, as it is 
 the wood of the same summer that produces the fall crop. The Red Cretan, 
 is a raspberry of delicate flavour; the Cane is also considerably cultivated, 
 and a number of others ; the Purple Flowering is only useful as an ornamental 
 plant, its fruit being of no value." 

William Robert Prince, son of William, in his admirable Pomological 
 Manual, 1832, gives a much more detailed account of the raspberries then 
 grown in the United States, both as to pomological varieties and as to 
 species. He published clear and accurate descriptions of twelve garden 
 varieties and names six more varieties which " merit culture." He changes 
 the name of English Red, a native berry cultivated as we have seen since 
 before 1771, to Common Red and puts it tmder R. avtericanus. This old 
 native, now to go under the name Common Red, seems to be the best known 
 and the most widely cultivated red raspberry of that time. Prince^ writes 
 of it: 

"This variety is a native of our state, and grows naturally in the 
 Catskill movmtains, but notwithstanding this fact, it is very frequently 
 denominated English Red. The shoots are of a dark red hue, and grow 
 to a great length, often attaining to ten or twelve feet, and even more. 
 On the shoots of the same year the spines at and near the base are of a 
 purplish colour, and those on the upper part, greenish with brown or pur- 
 plish barbs or points. The fruit is one of the earliest at maturity, of medium 
 size, fine flavour, and held in great estimation, as well for the dessert as 
 for making cherry brandy, &c. Indeed this is the only variety at present 
 cultivated to a great extent for the supply of the New York Market, and
