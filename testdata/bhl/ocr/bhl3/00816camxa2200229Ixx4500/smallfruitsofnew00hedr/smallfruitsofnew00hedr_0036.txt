12 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

uninvited in the gardens. That it was not earHer domesticated and 
 improved is due to the great abundance of the wild crop; to the preference 
 for the red raspberry, varieties of which were brought from Europe; and to 
 the fact that small fruits of all kinds received scant consideration frbm 
 fruit growers until recent years. 

It is impossible to say when the black raspberry was introduced into 
 cultivation. Brought from the fields into a good garden any wild black 
 raspberry plant becomes markedly more productive, and individual fruits 
 increase one-fourth or more in size. It is a convenience to have fruit at 
 hand and not have to go to fields or woods for the daily supply. There- 
 fore, thrifty housewives must have insisted on having plants of this fruit as 
 inhabitants of their gardens. All of the early American books on fruits 
 mention the black raspberry but do not list varieties. The first named 
 variety seems to have been the Ohio Everbearing, found by Nicholas 
 Longworth, Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1832, and by him named and offered as a 
 garden plant. 

Some years before this, about 1825, Thomas Rivers of Sawbridge- 
 worth, England, sowed seeds of a black raspberry and gave the offspring 
 attention through several generations for thirty or forty years. No perma- 
 nent varieties came from Rivers' work but his experience in part may be 
 repeated, as a very good accotmt of what happens in growing hybrid 
 raspberries. The account,^ considerably condensed, is as follows: 

" Some time ago (probably nearer forty than thirty years since) I 
 received from a very old gardener, living at Weathersfield, near Braintree, 
 in Essex, a curious kind of Raspberry, which he called the ' Black Rasp- 
 berry '. In the course of years I raised many generations from my Black 
 Raspberry; the seedlings all partook more or less of the qualities of the 
 parent stock, giving berries more or less piuple and acid, and keeping them- 
 selves distinct from our Red Antwerp and other sorts of Raspberries. Some 
 ten or twelve or more years since I received, among many novelties, from 
 the late A. J. Downing, of America, a plant of the Ohio Everbearing Rasp- 
 berry. This was planted, with other new kinds, in a department near to 
 my seedling black Raspberries, and, after observing its pecuUar nature of 
 bearing a full crop in autumn, it did not attract further notice, as its fruit 
 was small and acid. 

"A few years — perhaps two or three — after the introduction of this 
 sort, I happened to be passing a bed of my seedling black Raspberries which 
 had been raised in the usual way, and observing among them som_e canes 
 different in colour to the others — they had the blue tinge peculiar to the
