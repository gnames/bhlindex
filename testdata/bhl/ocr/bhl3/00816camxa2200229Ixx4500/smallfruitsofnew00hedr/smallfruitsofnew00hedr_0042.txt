THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Of the 68 plants, 59 bore spines and 9 were spineless. In manner of repro- 
 duction, 64 naturally grew from suckers and but 4 from tips. There is, 
 as these figures show, no stability in the R. negledus of Peck and other 
 botanists. The progeny of crosses between red and purple varieties to 
 the number of 759, and of red and black varieties to the number of 389, 
 give further evidence as to the characters of hybrids between these red and 
 black species and the great variability of the hybrids. 

Besides these hybrids between red and black raspberries there are 
 now many cioltivated brambles which are reputed offspring of one or 
 another of the red raspberries crossed with a blackberry or a dewberry. 
 Since these are generally less like raspberries than the other fruits, we 
 may leave them to be discussed with blackberries and dewberries. 

MAGNITUDE OF THE RASPBERRY INDUSTRY 

Raspberries began to attract attention as a commercial crop in the 
 United States in the seventies or early eighties of the last century. It is 
 doubtful if in 1880 there were more than 2000 acres of raspberries grown in 
 the coimtry. It will be interesting to see what growth raspberry growing 
 has made in the country in fifty years. Fortunately figures for our purpose 
 are available from the Fourteenth Census taken in 191 9. Table I gives 
 these figures.
