22 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

dwarfed, the leaves are slightly curled, and in two or three years the bush 
 is so weakened that it dies. Bluish streaks usually present near the base 
 of the canes suggested the name for this disease. The two diseases, leaf- 
 curl and streak, have been shown to respond to roguing in the same way that 
 mosaic does; new plantings may be made free from them but migrating 
 aphids according to variable conditions may cause rapid reinfection. 

"A fungous wilt of raspberries is commonly found in New York, par- 
 ticiilarly on black varieties. The symptoms caused by this fungous disease 
 include various degrees of dwarfing, after which the bush eventually dies. 
 The ftmgus is harbored in the soil and such crops as potatoes, tomatoes, 
 eggplant, and salsify are affected by it and should not be rotated or inter- 
 planted with raspberries. No other preventive measures are known for 
 wilt."
