THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

their full size the first year bearing large very characteristic foliage (in this state they are 
 called " turions " or " young canes "); in the second year short lateral branches appear 
 on them which bear flowers and fruits. The leaves on these flowering branches are always 
 much smaller. After flowering and fruiting these two-year-old canes die and are replaced 
 by other turions. The canes are either terete or angled, or angled and furrowed. In some 
 species the tip of the canes bends over, touches the soil, strikes root and gives rise to a new 
 plant. The leaves are alternate, either simple, lobed or pinnately or palmately or pedately 
 compound, mostly deciduous or in some species wintergreen or even evergreen. Petioles 
 and petiolules (or stalks of the leaflets) usually resemble the canes, i.e., are either glabrous, 
 hairy, glandular, bristly or prickly. Stipules are always present at the base of the petioles. 
 The flowers are always stalked and borne either solitary or racemose or panicled, 
 usually the lower flowers in the axils of leaves or leaf-like bracts. They are hermaphrodite, 
 i.e., with perfect stamens and styles. In some cases, however, they are unisexual, dioecious 
 or variously polygamo-dioecious. The hypanthium or the lower part of the calyx varies 
 from plane or rotate to saucer-shaped, hemispheric, campanulate, or turbinate. Calyx- 
 lobes or sepals valvate in bud, usuall}' s, but sometimes 6-S, sometimes unequal and the 
 larger ones with a prolonged somewhat foliaceous top. Petals as many as calyx-lobes, of 
 various size, white, rose, or pink colored. Stamens numerous, inserted densely on the 
 margin of the hypanthium and separated from the pistils by a disk; filaments filiform or 
 flattened, incurved in bud, erect or divaricate when mature. Pistils mostly numerous, 
 inserted on a convex, hemispherical, or conical receptacle or carpophore rising from the 
 center of the hypanthium and becoming either dry or fleshy; pistils laterally compressed, 
 with the style rising from the inner margin; stigma usually subclavate or slightly 2 -lobed; 
 ovules two, collateral, one of them abortive. In the fruit the pistils are transformed into 
 small, more or less juicy, and coherent drupelets, which either detach easily from the 
 receptacle (or core) as a thimble or cap (as in the Raspberries), or do not detach from the 
 fleshy core and fall off together with it (as in the Blackberries and the Dewberries), or 
 detach singly or become more or less dry, as in some species of warmer countries. The 
 fruits are usually red, yellow, or black, rarely green.
