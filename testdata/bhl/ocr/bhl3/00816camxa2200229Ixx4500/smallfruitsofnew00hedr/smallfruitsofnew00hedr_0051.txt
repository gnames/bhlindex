Small herbaceous perennial with creeping rootstock and erect flowering stems, 
 10-20 cm high with about 2-5 leaves or more, slightly pubescent or glabrous. Petioles 
 longer than the blade, slender; stipules ovoid, obtuse or pointed; leaves simple, cordate or 
 reniform at the base, broader than long, the lower ones almost entire, the others deeply 
 3-lobed, the lobes obtuse or roundish, doubly crenate or serrate, glabrate at length, 3-6 cm 
 wide. Flowers solitar>-, terminal, peduncles overtopping the leaves, often with 6-8 sepals 
 and petals. Calyx finely puberulous, lobes narrowly lanceolate, acuminate; petals obovate 
 or oblanceolate, long clawed, rose colored, exceeding the calyx -lobes; stamens numerous 
 with dilated filaments. Fruit globose with 20-25 drupelets, glabrous; putamen smooth;

Arctic Raspberry.— Herbaceous perennial, with a slender creeping rootstock. Stems 
 S-20 cm high, finely pubescent, 2- to 6-leaved; stipules large, obovate, rounded; petioles 
 2-4 cm long, finely pubescent; leaflets 3, simply or doubly toothed, lateral ones sessile, 
 broadly obovate-rounded, on the upper leaves more acute, terminal ones short stalked, more 
 or less acute, especially the upper ones. Flowers 1-3, polygamo-dioecious, 5- to lo-parted; 
 sepals lanceolate, acute, finely pubescent; petals obovate, entire or emarginate, 7-10 mm 
 long, rose-red. Fruit globose, dark red, fragrant, edible.

 Canadian Rocky Mountains in the New World. The fruit is smaller than 
 that of R. chamaemorus; when full grown and ripe it is not unlike that of 
 the raspberry.
