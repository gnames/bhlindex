30 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Most of the species of this subgenus are North American, two are

Flowering Raspberry. â€” Erect shrub, with perennial stems, 1-3 m high, bushy. Stems 
 with pale brown flaky peeling bark, in the young parts more or less villous and densely 
 glandular-hispid. Leaves large, simple, maple-like on long stalks, cordate at base, roundish 
 in outline, 5- to 7-lobed, rather firm, green and sparingly hairy on both sides, lobes acute, 
 lobulate, fine and sharply doubly toothed, the middle lobe the largest, 10-30 cm wide. 
 Petioles roundish, glandular-hispid, about as long as the blades, stipules acute. Flower.'; 
 numerous, subcorymbose, fragrant, 4-5 cm across; pedicels and calyxes densely beset witli 
 stalked brownish glands; caljoc-lobes ovate, caudate or suddenly contracted into a long 
 narrow point; petals roundish, deep rose colored; stamens very numerous, shorter than the

Eastern North America; from Nova Scotia to the Saskatchewan River, 
 south to Michigan and in the mountains as far as Tennessee and Georgia, 
 chiefly in half shady places, in glens, on wet rocks, woods, and roadsides. 
 Not much of a fruit plant, but a very ornamental shrub; introduced into 
 Europe as early as 1770 and now commonly cultivated. It flowers from 
 June to September. 

A rather constant species. The following varieties are worth noting:
