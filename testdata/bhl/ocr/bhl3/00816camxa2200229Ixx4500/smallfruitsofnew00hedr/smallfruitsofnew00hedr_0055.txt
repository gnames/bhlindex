Rocky Mountain Thimbleberry, Salmonbeny.â€” Erect shrub very similar to R. odoratus, 
 up to 8 feet high; young shoots downy and more or less glandular. Leaves similar to those 
 of R. odoratus, mostly 5-lobed, more reniform at the base, the lobes triangxilar, pointed, 
 the middle one somewhat longer, irregularly toothed, pubescent on both sides, especially 
 imdemeath. Flowers 3-7, large, showy, pure white; pedicel and calyx densely tomentose 
 and glandular; cah'^c-lobes ovate suddenly contracted into a long narrow point; petals 
 roundish oval, longer than the calj'x-lobes. Fruit large, 15-20 mm across, red. 

Cetitral and western North America; from Wisconsin to the West as 
 far as British Columbia in the North, and south to California, New Mexico, 
 and northern Mexico. 

The name parviflorus is very inappropriate for this species, as it has 
 large flowers, larger than those of R. odoratus, its next ally and geographical 
 sister species. Var. fraseriana, T. K. Henry Torreya 18:54, 1918, is a form 
 with laciniate and dentate basal part of the petals. Besides, there occur 
 forms with deeper cut or laciniate leaves.
