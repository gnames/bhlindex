Rocky Mountain Flowering Raspberry. — Erect shrub, 1-2.5 I'n high, branches peren- 
 nial, slightly arching at the top; young stems pale reddish brown, downy; bark peeling off 
 later on. Leaves simple, roundish cordate, wider than long, with 3-5-7 short, rounded lobes 
 and small, ovate, sharp teeth, 2-6 cm wide; green on both sides, sparingly hairy above 
 but soon glabrous, longer so on the veins beneath and often finely glandular pruinose. 
 Petioles and the lanceolate-acuminate stipules downy. Flowering branches lateral, with 
 similar but smaller leaves ; flowers large and show^^ rose-like, 4-6 cm across or more, white, 
 solitary on slender, but firm, downy peduncles. Calyx-lobes ovate, cuspidate, entire or 
 toothed, pubescent and more or less glandular; petals roundish or broadly obovate, stamens 
 numerous; pistils pubescent. Fruit half-round, surrounded by the appressed calyx; 
 dark purple; drupelets numerous, almost dry. 

Southwestern North America; in the mountains of Colorado and prob- 
 ably also of Arizona and New Mexico. A desirable, free-flowering, and very 
 hardy ornamental shrub, but not a fruit plant; the name " deliciosus " was 
 probably given for its profusely borne, fine, rose-like flowers. Contrary to 
 other Rubi this species is difficult to propagate. It does not sucker, cut- 
 tings strike but slowly, and layers often take as long as a year before they 
 are properly rooted. There are several varieties in cultivation, the most 
 desirable one has flowers almost twice as large as those of the more common 
 kind. In habit and foliage R. deliciosus resembles some kinds of currants 
 more than a bramble. There are three or possibly more related species, all 
 natives of southwestern United States, Mexico, and Guatemala.

Raspberries. — Canes usually biennial, erect, arching or decurving at the top and 
 sometimes rooting from the tip, in some species scandent or prostrate; usually prickly, 
 sometimes bristly or glandular bristly. Leaves in some species simple and lobed, in others 
 odd-pinnately compound, in a few 5-foliolate digitate or pedate; petioles with adnate 
 narrow stipules. Flowers and inflorescences various; caljTC-lobes almost equal, petals often 
 fugacious. Fruit composed of many cohering drupelets, dissolving at maturity from the 
 core as a thimble or a cap. 

This subgenus is composed of numerous species inhabiting all the five 
 continents. They are especially numerous in the northern hemisphere and 
 chiefly in the temperate and subtropical regions of Asia from the Himalaya 
 to Japan, western and central China being extremely rich in species. Some 
 species are very important fruit plants and are cultivated largely as rasp- 
 berries ; others may be useful for the plant breeder and many are ornamental 
 garden plants.
