Canes erect, arching and branched at the top, 1-2 m high, black or red brown, furrowed 
 and armed with a few small straight prickles. Leaves green, glabrate or downy beneath, 
 simple, cordate-ovate, acute, 3- to 5-lobed and palmately veined, lobes acute, the middle 
 one larger, contracted at its base, the margins coarsely unequally serrate and notched 
 petioles and midveins beneath pubescent and amied with scattered hooked prickles 
 stipules linear-lanceolate. Flowering branches pubescent, leaves often only 3-lobed 
 flowers small, few or several, fascicled or clustered in a short racems, short stalked, a few 
 lower ones sometimes axillar and longer stalked; bracts lanceolate; caly.K more or less 
 pubescent, lobes ovate-deltoid, acuminate; petals white, about as long, elliptic, clawed, 
 crimped at the margins, spreading in the open flower; stamens in one row; pistils numerous, 
 glabrous. Fruit half round, shining deep or black blood red, edible. 

Northern China, Korea, and Japan; a robust plant with a spreading 
 rootstock, very hardy. On good soil the leaves of the turions reach 20-30 
 cm in diameter. Only the leaves on flowering shoots can be compared 
 with Crataegus; those of the turions resemble more the leaves of the maple. 
 Although the fruit is edible, it has been little cultivated as a fruit plant, but 
 has been recommended for planting on loose rough banks, where the strong 
 spreading rootstocks help to hold the soil.

Spreading by suckers, 1.5-2.5 m high, canes terete, finely downy and with broad-based 
 straight prickles, branching near the top. Leaves simple, purplish when young, cordate- 
 ovate, 8-15 cm long or more, those of the new canes deeply 3-lobed, dull green above, 
 pubescent beneath, irregularly toothed; petiole much shorter than the blade, prickly as 
 well as the midveins. Flowers solitary or few together on short lateral twigs, white. 
 Fruit large, bright red, said to be delicious and of a vinous flavor. 

Japan, China; a rather variable species. Introduced by E. H. Wilson,
