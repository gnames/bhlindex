Salmonberry. — Erect shmb, reaching 2-5 m, freely suckering; new canes armed 
 with fine prickles at the base, smooth for the rest, terete. Leaves 3-foliolate; stipules 
 linear or subulate ; petiole slender, glabrous, rarely with a few fine prickles ; lateral leaflets 
 sessile, obliquely ovate, acute, terminal one larger, ovate or rhomboid, acuminate, round or 
 subcordate at the base, 4-10 cm long, incisedly double serrate, all rather thin, glabrous and 
 green on both sides. Flowers showy, usually solitary' or 2-3, terminal on small sideshoots; 
 peduncles slender, glabrous, with or without a small bract below the middle. CaljTc- 
 lobes ovate, acute, pubescent with adpressed hairs. Petals elliptic, pointed, rose colored, 
 twice as long as the calyx-lobes. Stamens and styles numerous. Fruit large, ovoid, orange- 
 yellow, or dark wine-red, 15-20 mm long and 12-15 rnm across, edible. 

Western North America; from Alaska south to Idaho and California, 
 common in wet woods, along streams, etc. This plant is hardy in England 
 and many parts of Europe, where it is grown as an ornamental shrub. It 
 is hardy at Geneva, but it does not reach more than about 3 feet and seldom 
 flowers. It is not very productive even in its native home, although the 
 fruits are handsome and agreeable, but perhaps it may be used in cross- 
 fertilization with other hardier and more productive kinds. The orange- 
 yellow or salmon-colored berries are said to be the better flavored ones, 
 while the dark wine-colored berries have a bitter after taste. The two kinds 
 grow together and are indistinguishable, except by the color of the fruit. 

Hybrids are recorded with R. idaeus, R. idaeur, var. mburnifolius and with R. idaeus 
 var. canadensis. A closely allied species is the following: 

Rubus franciscanus. Rydberg A'. .4 «!. F/. 22:441. 19 13. 

Ritbtis spectabilis var. Menziesii. Watson Bot. Cal. 1:172. 1S76; not R. menziesii. 
 Hooker. 18^2. 

Very similar in habit and structure to R. spectabilis, but the stems hairy at first, the 
 leaves of a firmer texture, hairy above and densely white or grayish tomentose underneath ; 
 flowering branches, petioles, and peduncles equally hirsute; calyx-lobes densely silky from 
 long adpressed shining hairs. 

Central California to southern Oregon; chiefly in the Redwood belt. This 
 is quite a distinct and very attractive species, but sometimes intermediate 
 forms are encountered.

Akalaberry, Hawaian Giant Raspberry. — Stems procumbent, tomentose or pubescent 
 and with fine bristly prickles. Stipules subulate. Leaves 3-foliolate, those of the flowering
