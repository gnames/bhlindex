Erect evergreen shrub, 2-2.5 m high, in temperate climes lower, stems erect or clamber- 
 ing, branching at the top, loosely hairy and glandular and with scattered recurved prickles. 
 Leaves pinnately 5- to 7-foliolate, rarely also 9-1 1 leaflets, the uppermost 3-foliolate or 
 simple; petioles hairy, prickly; stipules linear; leaflets thin, ovate or oblong-lanceolate, 
 acuminate, large and regularly doubly serrate, light green and hairy on both sides, 5-7 cm 
 long. Flowers terminal or axillary in few-flowered cymes, about 4 cm across; pedicels 
 hairy, sometimes with a few stalked glands or fine prickles; calyx hairy, lobes ovate-lanceo- 
 late, caudate; petals roundish obovate, white; stamens numerous, with flattened filaments. 
 Fruits rather large, thimble shaped, 26-35 mm across, with ver>- numerous. small drupelets, 
 glabrous, bright red or orange. 

Southern and eastern Asia, Philippine Islands, New Guinea, eastern 
 Australia; now subspontaneous in many tropical and subtropical countries, 
 for instance in South Africa, Chile, Brazil, and the West Indies. " In 
 Porto Rico it is completely established. In the Aibonito district the fruit 
 is gathered by children and sold to travelers along the Military Road. 
 The fruit is bright red and attractive, although not of high quality."

R. rosaefolius va.v. coronarius. Sims 5o/. Mag. PL 1283. 1816. This 
 is a double-flowered form often planted in the tropics as an ornamental 
 shrub, known as " Briar Rose " or " Bridal Rose." 

Rubus probus. Bailey Gent. Herb. 1:150. 1923- 

Erect shrub, 2-2.5 m high, similar to R. rosaefolius, but less prickly and glabrous on 
 the petioles, leaf-blades and pedicels; new canes arching, not climbing. Leaflets 3-9, 
 but mostly 7, broader and ovate-lanceolate or ovate, prominently and approximately veined, 
 and margins deeply and sharply doubly toothed. Leaves on new canes 20-25 cm long, the 
 leaflets 10 cm long. Flowers corymbose, rather numerous, about 9-10 together at the end 
 of the branches, rather large; pedicels about as long as the petioles; calyx-lobes shortly 
 pointed, not caudate, not or scarcely exceeding the petals. Fruit flat; drupelets very 
 numerous, red, detaching from the receptacle like a ring, i. e., the central pistils have not 
 been developed leaving thus a hole in the middle of the fruit. 

Porto Rico; a cultivated plant, of doubtful origin; related to R. rosae- 
 folius; perhaps R. ellipticus x rosaefolius. 

The " Cardinal Balloon Berry " of Burbank is a native species from 
 central China of this series, but of which it is not yet possible to say.
