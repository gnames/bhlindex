38 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Series 4. Pungentes. Focke Spec. Rub. 2:160. igii; Ibid. 3:264. 19 14. 

Leaves 3-foliolate, but mostly pinnately 5- to ii-foliolate. Flowers solitary or a few, 
 loosely clustered, rather large. Drupelets less numerous than in the Rosaefolii, and the 
 core dry at maturity. 

About 15 species; mostly from China. 

A. Peduncles smooth; petals white R. biflorus 

AA. Peduncles hirsute and prickly; petals reddish purple R. lasiostylus 

Rubus biflorus. Buchanan ex Smith in Rees Cyc. 30:32. 18 19; Focke Spec. Rub. 
 2:166. 191 1 ; Bailey Stand. Cyc. Hort. 5:3027. 1916. 

R. kucodermis Hort. not Dougl. 

Robust shrub with stout erect stems, 2-3 m high; canes arching, branched, terete, 
 armed with stout, straight, broad-based prickles and covered with a thick, white, waxy layer. 
 Leaves pinnate, 3- to s-foliolate, dark green and with scattered hairs above and white felty 
 beneath, leaflets sessile, obliquely ovate, acute, sharply and irregularly doubly toothed, 
 terminal ones broader more ovate and often somewhat 3-lobed; petioles long, with scattered 
 hooked prickles, waxy white; stipules linear. Flowering branches short, leaves 3-foliolate, 
 leaflets deeper incised. Flowers mostly 2-3, sometimes more, peduncles rather long, smooth 
 or almost so, drooping. Calyx pubescent, lobes broadly ovate, mucronate or caudate; 
 petals broad, round, white, exceeding the calyx; stamens and pistils numerous. Fruit 
 drooping, rather large, roundish, yellow, edible. 

Himalaya, up to 10,000 feet, and southwestern China; chiefly valuable 
 as an ornamental shrub ; very effective on lawns during winter because of its 
 waxy white canes. The flowers are showier and larger than those of the 
 common raspberry and its fruit is attractive. There is a variety, quinque- 
 y?on^5, Focke in Sargent PI. Wilson. 1:53. 191 1, which has 3-8 flowers. 
 It comes from western Szechwan and is probably hardier and more 
 productive. 

Rubus lasiostylus. Focke in Hooker Ic. PL 1951. 1891; Focke Spec. Rub. 2:167. 
 1911 ; Bailey Stand. Cyc. Hort. 5:3027. 1916. 

Canes erect, 1.2-1.8 mhigh, stout, covered with a waxy bluish white bloom, glabrous, 
 but covered with ntunerous slender pungent bristles. Leaves pinnately 3- to 5-foliolate; 
 lateral leaflets ovate, coarsely and unevenly doubly toothed, terminal one much larger, 
 cordate at the base, more or less 3-lobed and lobately toothed along the upper half, with 
 scattered hairs above and densely white felty beneath. Flowers few, rather small ; pedicels 
 hirsute and prickly; calyx tomentose or prickly, lobes ovate-lanceolate-acuminate; petals 
 reddish purple, shorter than the calyx-lobes, fugacious. Fruit roundish, red, downy, 
 25 mm across, with an agreeable acid taste. 

Central China; from the Province Hupeh, 

Usually cultivated for its white-colored canes; the fruits are said to be 
 of little importance.
