 the tip, terete, villous and densely covered with stalked, red-brown glands of various length, 
 mixed with scattered, brown, straight prickles, as is the whole plant, the petioles, petiolules,

 5 -foliolate, dark green and sparingly pilose or glabrate above, densely white tomentose 
 beneath, simply or doubly toothed; teeth broad, obtuse, mucronate; stipules filiform;

 sessile, terminal leaflet stalked, large, cordate-ovate or somewhat 3-lobed, suddenly con- 
 tracted into a short narrow point, from the middle lobately toothed. Flowering shoots
