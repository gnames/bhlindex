THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

duced in 1890 by John Lewis Childs; into England about 1876. R. phoe- 
 nicolasiits has been hybridized with R. idaeus. One of these hybrids has 
 been described as: 

Rubus paxii. Focke .4Wj. Nat. Ver. Bremen 19:204. 1908; Focke Spec. Rub. 2:192. 
 191 1. R. phoenicolasiiis x idaeus. Wilson Rep. Int. Coiif. Genet. 209. 1906. 

Habit and glandulosity much like that of R. pJtoenicolasius, but lower leaves often 
 pinnately 5-foliolate and leaflets narrower. Petals and filaments white, rose colored at 
 the base. 

A similar hybrid has been produced at Geneva. It is a cross with the 
 Empire raspberry. In some individuals of this cross the stems are more 
 prickly, but scarcely glandular. Another interesting hybrid between 
 R. phoenicolasius and the Agawam blackberry was raised at Geneva. 

Rubus adenophorus. Rolfe Kew Bid. 3S2. 1910; Focke Spec. Rub 3:270 1914; 
 Bailey Stoid Cyc. Hort. 5:3027. 1916. 

R. sa gains. Focke Spec. Rub. i:ig8. 1911. 

Deciduous shrub, 1.5-3 m high; stems erect or arching, stout, densely beset with 
 bristles, large dark-stalked glands and broad-based prickles. Leaves pinnately s-foliolate ; 
 petiole and petiolules bristly and glandular; leaflets 5-13 cm long, ovate, shortly pointed, 
 roundish or cordate at the base, sharply and doubly toothed, dull green and hairy on both 
 sides, the lateral ones sessile, the terminal one larger, subtrilobate and lobately doubly 
 dentate in the upper half. Leaves of the flowering shoots similar, 3-foliolate, the uppermost 
 simple. Flowers in terminal panicles, densely bristly and glandular; short stalked, calyx- 
 lobes ovate, long mucronate; petals shorter, pink, toothed. Fruit round, almost 15 mm 
 across, finally black, edible. 

Central China, western Hupeh; introduced by E. H. Wilson in 1907. 
 More an ornamental shrub for its fine foliage and the red glandular canes 
 than a fruit plant. 

Rubus innominatus. Moore /oht. Bot. ^:226. 1875; Focke5^ec. Rub. 2:195. iQn; 
 Bailey Stand. Cyc. Hort. 5:3027. 1916; Bean Trees & Shrubs 2:461. 1921. 

Erect shrub, 2-2.5 â„¢ high; canes and petioles adpressedly downy, gray, glandular 
 and armed with scattered straight prickles. Leaves pinnately 5-foliolate, rarely 7-foliolate, 
 the uppermost 3-foliolate; leaflets irregularly and deeply toothed, teeth mucronate, with 
 stiff hairs above and grayish or whitish tomentose beneath; lateral leaflets almost sessile, 
 obliquely oblong or ovate-lanceolate, terminal ones ovate or ovate-lanceolate-acuminate; 
 stipules small, filiform. Inflorescence panicled, tomentose and densely beset with short 
 stalked glands and sometimes a few prickles; pedicels short; flowers small; calyx-lobes 
 ovate; petals roundish, rose colored, shorter than the calyx-lobes. Fruit half round, orange- 
 red. 

Central and western China. Probably not in cultivation. A variety 
 " Van Fleet " came from a cross between R. " innominatus " x Cuthbert; 
 (see under R. kuntzeanus).
