THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 4 1 

Rubus niveus. Thunberg Dissert, de Rub. 9, fig. 3. 1813; Focke Spec. Rub. 2:182. 
 1911; Bailey Stand. Cyc. Hort. 5:3029. 1916. 

Strong-growing shrab, 1-2 m high or more; canes terete, with long straight or curved 
 prickles, downy when young with a dense white bloom later on. Leaves with 2-4 or rarely 
 5 pairs of leaflets, but mostly 7-foliolate, leaflets oblong or rhomboid-oblong or ovate- 
 lanceolate, with 6-8 lateral veins on each side, variously coarsely and often doubly serrate, 
 dull green and sparingly hairy above, silvery white tomentose underneath. Inflorescence 
 paniculate, enlarged by lower axillar branches, villous or tomentose. Flowers small; 
 caly.K whitish tomentose, petals roundish, shorter than the calyx-lobes, rose colored or 
 purple. Fruit subglobular, smooth, whitish, reddish later on and bluish black when ripe, 
 edible, acidulous. 

India; along the southern slopes of the Himalaya to Sikkim, at eleva- 
 tions from 4500-9000 feet, in southern China, in Ceylon, and cultivated in 
 some places for its fruit. This species seems to have a wide distribution 
 and to be rather variable. It does not seem to be cultivated in the United 
 States, but may be useful in producing a raspberry for the warmer southern 
 states. 

Rubus kuntzeanus. Hemsley Jour. Linn. Soc. 23:232. 1887; Focke Spec. Rub. 
 2:195. 1911 ; Bailey Stand. Cyc. Hort. 5:3028. 1916; Bean Trees & Shrubs 2:461. 1921. 

R. innoininatus Hort., not S. Moore. 

Shrub 2-2.5 ni high; canes grayish velvety downy and with scattered broad-based 
 prickles. Leaves pinnately 3- to 5-foliolate, dark green and slightly hairy above, densely 
 white tomentose underneath, irregularly toothed; lateral leaflets very short'y stalked, 
 obliquely ovate, 5-10 cm long, rounded at the base, acuminate; terminal ones larger and 
 broader, cordate and often somewhat 3-lobed; petiole and rhachis and midveins downy 
 and prickly. Inflorescence a long narrow panicle, the lower branches axillary, peduncles 
 and calyxes tomentose, not glandular nor prickly. Flowers small, shortly stalked; calyx- 
 lobes ovate, shortly mucronate; petals scarcely longer, pink, suborbicular, fugacious. 
 Fruits roundish, 2 cm across, orange-red, edible and of good flavor. 

Central and western China; introduced by Augustine Henry in 1886 and 
 again by E. H. Wilson about 1905. It comes near to R. innominatiis S. 
 Moore, but it is glandless. From this species the " Van Fleet Raspberry," 
 which is said to be a hybrid between R. innominatiis and the variety 
 Cuthbert is derived. All the characters of this hybrid seem to prove that 
 it is a cross with R. kuntzeanus and not with R. innominatus S. Moore. 
 The " Van Fleet " is entirely glandless and 3-foliolate on canes and 
 inflorescence. 

Rubus giraldianus. Focke in Engler Bot. Jahrb. 29:401. 1901; Focke Spec. Rub. 
 2:194. 191 1 ; Bailey Stand. Cyc. Hort. 5:3029. 1916. 

Very prickly robust shrub, canes terete, stout, up to 3 m high, arching and with hang- 
 ing branches at the summit, brownish, covered with a fine whitish blue bloom ; prickles
