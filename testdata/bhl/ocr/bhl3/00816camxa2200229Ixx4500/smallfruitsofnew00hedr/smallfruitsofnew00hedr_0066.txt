Golden Evergreen Raspberry. â€” Vigorous shrub with perennial climbing stems, 1-5 
 m long; canes terete or obscurely angled, like the petioles densely hispid from long reddish 
 hairs, mixed with flattened straight prickles. Leaves 3-foliolate; petioles 3-7 cm long, 
 like the petiolules and mid\-eins armed with recurved prickles; stipules small subulate; 
 leaflets sharply and finely double-serrate, elliptic or obovate, obtuse or emarginate, cor- 
 iaceous, dark green and almost or quite glabrous above, white or grayish tomentose beneath, 
 the lateral ones shortly stalked or almost sessile, the terminal one longer stalked and larger. 
 Flowers 15-25 mm across, clustered on axillar branchlets or terminal and paniculed, 
 tomentose ; calyx-lobes ovate, acute ; petals white, obovate, scarcely longer. Fruit vellow 
 to golden yellow, of the shape and size of a raspberry and of good quality. 

Himalayas; in elevations from 3000-6000 feet, naturalized in Jamaica;
