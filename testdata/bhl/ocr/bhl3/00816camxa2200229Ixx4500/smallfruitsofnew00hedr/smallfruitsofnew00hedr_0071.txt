 S-foliolate, leaflets more or less ovate, pointed and doubly serrate, lateral ones sessile, green

 cal varieties, often considered as different species or subspecies, but usually 
 connected by numerous intermediate forms, and not always readily 
 identified. 

The following is a key to these varieties : 
 A. Inflorescence pubescent or felty with adpressed grayish or whitish hairs, more or less 
 prickly, but without glands 
 B. Canes not bristly to the top 

C. Inflorescence elongately racemose i. R- idaeus vulgatus 

D. Leaflets of flowering shoots 3-foliolate 
 E. Leaflets white underneath, narrow lanceolate or ovate-lanceolate, st'-ongly 
 toothed la. R. idaeus vulgatus forma angustif alius
