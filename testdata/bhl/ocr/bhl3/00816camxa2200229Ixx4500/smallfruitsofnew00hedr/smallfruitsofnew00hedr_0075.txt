Canes erect, arching at the top, reddish or brownish, sometimes with a whitish bloom, 
 glabrous and more or less densely beset with fine bristles. Leaves of the canes 3- but mcstly 
 5-foliolate, rather thin, more or less glabrous above, white tomentose below; stipules 
 small, setaceous; petioles, petiolules and midveins glabrous but finely bristly and glandular; 
 lateral leaflets sessile, obliquely ovate, pointed, doubly serrate, the teeth ovate, mucronate ; 
 the lowest pair larger, often sublobed; terminal leaflet cordate-ovate, shortly acuminate 
 or more or less 3-lobed, about 8 cm long. Flowering branches glabrous, but prickly and 
 glandular, often glaucous. Leaves 3-foliolate, narrower and more pointed, uppermost 
 simple lanceolate. Flowers racemose, drooping; pedicels and calyx and calyx-lobes not 
 tomentose, distinctly glandular, bristly and prickly. Fruit hemispherical, light red. 

Eastern Asia and North America; from southern British Columbia 
 to southern Newfoundland, south to Oregon, Wyoming, the Great Lakes 
 and Mrginia. It varies a good deal but is always easily distinguished by 
 its more slender habit, the canes are less erect, the leaves narrower and 
 thinner than in R. idaeus vulgatus. From this variety the American culti- 
 vated red raspberries are derived.
