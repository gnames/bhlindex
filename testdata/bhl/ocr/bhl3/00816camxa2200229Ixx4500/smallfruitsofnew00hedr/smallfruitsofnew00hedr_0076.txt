52 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Western North America; Alaska to the Mackenzie River and south to 
 British Columbia, and perhaps to Wyoming and Utah. 

10. Rubus idaeus var. egglestonii Blanchard. Femald Rhodora 21:97. iQiQ- 
 R. egglestonii. Blanchard Torreya 7:140. 1907. 

Similar in every way to R. idaeus var. strigosus, but the leaves of the new canes 3-folio- 
 late and with roundish ovate or orbicular leaflets; the flowering branches with simple reni- 
 form-orbicular more or less 3-lobed leaves. 

Eastern North America; Vermont, on limestone ledges and on dry rocky 
 soil; rather rare. A most remarkable variety which corresponds to R. 
 idaeus obtusifolius and to R. leucodermis trinitatis. A similar form may be 
 expected from R. occidentalis, but has not yet been found. 

11. Rubus idaeus var. heterolasius. Femald /?/wdora 21:97. iQiQ- 

New canes as well as the branches and inflorescence greenish, tomentose, glandular 
 and prickly with variously mixed larger prickles and bristles; leaflets white tomentose 
 beneath, finely crenate. 

Eastern North America; Maine; rare. 

12. Rubus idaeus var. canadensis. Richardson Appendix in Frankl. Journey, ist Ed. 
 747. 1823; Femald /?/!0(iora 21 : 97. 1919. 

R. carolinianus. Rydberg N. >1;h. F/. 22:447. 1913- 

R. sxtharcticus. Ibid. 22:448. 1913. 

Canes 0.5-1 m high, brownish, densely tomentose and densely beset with fine 
 spreading brist.es, bristles of various length, some slightly stronger, more or less intermixed 
 with stalked glands. Leaves of the young canes 5- or 3-foliolate; stipules subulate, small; 
 petioles, petiolules and midveins pubescent, hispid from bristles and stalked glands; leaflets 
 similar to those of var. strigosus, but somewhat broader, firmer in texture and the termi- 
 nal ones more cordate especially on the 3-foliolate leaves. Flowering branches and petioles 
 almost glabrous; sparingly and shortly prickly and little glandular, leaves 3-foliolate, 
 doubly toothed, the uppermost simple, narrow. Pedicels and calyx densely bristly and 
 glandular. 

Eastern Asia, North America; from Alaska to Labrador, south to Nan- 
 tucket and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and locally in Michigan, South 
 Dakota, Colorado, and in the mountains of North Carolina; often on swampy 
 grotmd. The United States Department of Agriculture distributed several 
 strains of this variety canadensis which were collected in 191 6 by Mr. M. J. 
 Dorsey in various parts of Manitoba, Canada, and were chosen for their 
 productiveness as well as for the size and flavor of the fruits. This variety 
 has a large geographical area and varies considerably in the canes as to color, 
 tomentum, and bristles, the shape and size of the leaflets, the amount of 
 glandulosity, and bristles in the inflorescence. The following forms are 
 worthy to be recorded, but they are not the only ones.
