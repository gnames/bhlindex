CI THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

pedicels and calyx-lobes, variously armed with slender, slightly curved 
 prickles, but without glands throughout. American varieties derived from 
 R. idaeiis strigosiis have the flowering branches scarcely or very slightly 
 pubescent, the leaflets usually narrower, more acuminate, thinner and not 
 quite as silvery white beneath, the pedicels and the calyx-lobes have little 
 or no white felt, but are more or less densely glandular bristly, and similar 
 glands occur on other parts of the plants, chiefly on the petioles. 

The varieties derived from a cross between R. idaeus vulgatus x R. 
 idaeiis strigosiis are very numerous. They are variously mixed, but are 
 usually less glandular and less felty in the infloresence. Where the influence 
 of R. occidentalis is traceable it is shown by the glabrous flowering branches, 
 the pointed, very sharply toothed leaflets of the inflorescence, often bluish 
 white underneath, the rather stiff, glabrous pedicels with many reflexed or 
 falcate prickles, and the terminal pedicels more or less densely clustered. 

The hybrids between Rubus occidentalis and R. idaeus var. strigosiis

Purple Raspberries. — Canes much like those of R. occidentalis, prickly, but not bristly, 
 arching and rooting from the tip. Leaves variable, pedate or pinnate, or pedate and pin- 
 nate or trifoliolate, leaflets sharply doubly toothed; the terminal leaflet usually lobately 
 dentate above the middle as in R. occidentalis. Flowering branches glabrous. Inflores- 
 cence mostly intermediate, flowers in axillar and terminal corymbs; pedicels rather stiff, 
 more or less felty, prickly, prickles recurved as in R. occidentalis, occasionally with a few 
 glands; sepals more spreading. Fruit dark red. 

The plants of this hybrid group vary so much that it is hardly advisable 
 to retain a specific name for them. Sometimes they resemble one parent; 
 sometimes the other. Some are crosses between R. idaeus vulgatus and R. 
 occidentalis. Pomologically they are of great importance as a very pro- 
 ductive race of raspberries.

Shrubs, canes mostly biennial, erect or prostrate, variously armed; leaves digitately 
 or pedately 3- to 5-foliolate. Drupelets uniting with the core and dehiscing together from 
 the receptacles; known as dewberries and blackberries.
