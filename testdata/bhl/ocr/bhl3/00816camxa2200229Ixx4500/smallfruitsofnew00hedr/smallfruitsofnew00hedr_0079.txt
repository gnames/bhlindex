THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 55 

DEWBERRIES AND BLACKBERRIES 

This subgenus inhabits the temperate regions of northwestern Asia, 
 Europe, northern Africa, North America, and along the mountains in South 
 America. It is abundantly rich in individuals and forms in Europe and 
 northeastern America. This subgenus presents the greatest difficulties to 
 the botanist. The various species with their numerous satelites, variously 
 considered as subspecies, microspecies, varieties, forms, and hybrids, can be 
 grouped in a number of series, which, if once understood, are in most cases 
 readily distinguished. It must not be forgotten, however, that the many 
 individual variations and the intermediate hybrid forms make it difficult to 
 work out tmder each of these series satisfactory keys.
