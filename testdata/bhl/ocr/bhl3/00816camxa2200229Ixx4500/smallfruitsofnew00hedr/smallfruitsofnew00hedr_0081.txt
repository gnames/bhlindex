THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 57 

pubescent, with more or less numerous, slender, patent bristles and sometimes with stalked 
 glands; calj-x-lobes narrow, acuminate, often with pinnately cut tips, strongly reflexed 
 during the time of flowering. Fruit mostly somewhat elongate, smooth or pubescent, 
 with erect sepals. 

The Ursini-Ruhus are all natives of the Pacific Coast, extending east- 
 ward to Idaho. They form an extremely variable group, aU considered as 
 one species by Focke, while five species have been recognized by Rydberg 
 out of which three species are admitted here. The range of variation is 
 such, however, that it is often difficult to say where one species ends and 
 the next begins. The available herbarium material is insufficient as it 
 usually lacks the characteristic new canes taken from the same plant. A 
 satisfactory state of taxonomy can only be reached when all the region has 
 been carefully explored and reUable material has been collected. Even of 
 the three historical species of this group, R. vitifoliiis, R. ursinus, and 
 R. macropetalus, only flowering branchlets have been collected. The Ursini 
 are of great pomological importance as they form the Pacific Coast region 
 dewberries. 

A. Flowers usually either staminate or pistillate only, rarely hermaphrodite 

B. Canes usually glabrous or thinly pubescent, often glaucous, with scattered often 
 remote hooked prickles. Leaves thin, green on both sides, leaflets irregularly 
 toothed, mostly pointed. Pedicels, cal>'x, and calyx- lobes with more or less 

numerous stalked glands. Fruits mostly glabrous R. macropetalus 

BB. Canes varying from slightly pubescent to tomentose; prickles numerous and densely 

set, usually slender and straight or only sHghtly cur\'ed, mostly smaller ones between 

them. Leaves pubescent or more or less grayish tomentose beneath. Leaflets 

usually more obtuse. Pedicels and cabpi verj^ rarely with glands 

C. Canes pubescent, often becoming almost glabrous. Leaves glabrescent; the 

middle ones on the flowering shoots 3-lobed R- vitifohns 

CC. Canes tomentose, rarely becoming glabrous. Leaves grayish tomentose beneath; 

the middle ones on the flowering shoots 3-foliolate R- nrsintis
