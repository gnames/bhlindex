 22:459. 1913; Bailey Ge/zf. Herb. 1:154- 1923- 

Canes tomentose, terete, with numerous, slender, straight prickles. Leaves 3-foliolate, 
 grayish tomentose beneath with adpressed hairs above, leaflets broadly ovate, roundish, 
 doubly irregularly toothed; petioles tomentose and prickly, also the petiolules and the 
 midveins. Flowering branches angular, tomentose, and with patent slender prickles; 
 stipules lanceolate, hirsute; leaves 3-foliolate, lateral leaflets obliquely ovate, obtuse, almost 
 sessile, the tenninal ones subcordate, roundish ovate, bluntly pointed; the uppermost 
 leaves simple, cordate-ovate or somewhat 3-lobed. Flowers cor>'mbose, 3-5, on long 
 pedicels; pedicels grayish tomentose like the cah-s and with spreading, slender prickles, 
 usually without glands; calyx-lobes ovate-lanceolate with a long often crenate tip, grayish, 
 inside whitish tomentose. Petals of the staminate flowers large, oblong, white. 

California; first collected by Adalbert von Chamisso. This is the 
 very large and partially erect form so common about most thickets at the 
 lower levels. According to Bailey, Aughinbaugh, once much cultivated, 
 belongs either to this species or to R. vitifolius.

 or doubly toothed, rather thick, dark green above with a few scattered hairs, densely gray- 
 ish tomentose beneath. Flowering branches copiously prickly; leaves 3-foliolate, similar 
 to those of the turions, only smaller; the uppermost simple, cordate. Flowers corymbose, 
 large, bisexual, pedicels long, stout, tomentose and with patent prickles; calyx and the 
 ovate-lanceolate, long-pointed calyx-lobes pubescent and prickly; petals large, white.

Garden origin; only known as a cultivated plant; said to have origi- 
 nated in the garden of Judge J. H. Logan, Santa Cruz, California. The 
 loganberry was at first said to be a hybrid between the " common Calif omian 
 dewberry " and a raspberry. There is, however, no trace of a raspberry in 
 the character of this plant. Most likely it is a mutant offspring of R. ursinus, 
 from which it differs only in slight details and chiefly by its bisexual flowers, 
 but such can occasionally also be observed on R. ursinus. A cross was 
 raised at Geneva between the red raspberry Herbert and the loganberry.

 with numerous, stout, straight or hooked prickles from a broad base, with smaller ones
