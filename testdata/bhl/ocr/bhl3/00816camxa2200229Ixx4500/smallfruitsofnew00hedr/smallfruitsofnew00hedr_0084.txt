 lanceolate, rather long pointed, all rather thin, green on both sides, hairy when young but 
 soon glabrescent especially above, doubly and sharply serrate-dentate, the teeth more or 
 less lanceolate. Flowering branches more or less tomentose, angular, prickly; lower leaves 
 3-foliolate, upper one 3-lobed, the uppermost simple, cordate-ovate, all more or less pointed. 
 Flowers axillar and terminal in a loose corymb, large, bisexual; pedicels tomentose, like 
 the calyx with patent slender prickles, eglandular; calyx-lobes ovate-lanceolate with long

Garden origin; only known as cultivated plants, said to have originated 
 in the garden of Judge J. H. Logan, Santa Cruz, California, and now much 
 grown under the name of " Mammoth." Supposed to be a hybrid, but in 
 reality nothing is known about its origin. It is also known as Lowberry. 
 Crosses were made at Geneva, between Mammoth and Cuthbert (red rasp- 
 berry) , between Mammoth and Herbert (red raspberry) , between Mammoth 
 and Agawam (blackberry), between Mammoth and Snyder (blackberry), 
 and between Mammoth and Nanticoke (blackberry) .
