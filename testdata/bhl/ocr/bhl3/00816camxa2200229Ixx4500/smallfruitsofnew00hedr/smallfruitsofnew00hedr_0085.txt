Common Dewberry.— Low shrub, canes prostrate, terete, several feet long, rooting at 
 the tip, glabrescent, with numerous, irregularly scattered, small, strongly hooked prickles 
 from a broad compressed base. Leaves pedately 3- to s-foliolate, bright green with scat- 
 tered hairs and pubescent along the veins on both sides, firm, sharply and irregularly often 
 doubly toothed, teeth lanceolate, mucronate; lower and lateral leaflets sessile or almost so, 
 obliquely ovate or rhomboid-acuminate, terminal leaflet distinctly stalked, broadly or 
 roundish ovate, subcordate suddenly contracted into a long point, and coarsely toothed; 
 petiole and petiolules pubescent, like themidveins with scattered, hooked prickles; petioles 
 shorter than the leaflets; stipules lanceolate, cuspidate, puberulous and ciliate. Flowermg 
 branches erect, 10-30 cm long, slightly angular and puberulous, and with scattered, fine 
 prickles. Leaves 3-foliolate, puberulous with scattered hairs, especially along the vems, 
 sharply doubly toothed; leaflets ovate or rhomboid, tapering at both ends: the uppermost 
 leaves simple, variously lanceolate pointed or broader and 2- to 3-lobed. Flowers termmal 
 or axillary-, 1-5 or more, pedicels exceeding the leaves, the tenninal one usually the shortest, 
 puberulous and with scattered, spreading prickles. Calyx-lobes ovate, shortly pomted, 
 pubescent; petals longer, obovate; stamens and pistils numerous. Fruit roundish, calyx- 
 lobes adpressed. 

Eastern North America; from Maine to the Rocky Mountains and south 
 to the Gulf of Mexico, mostly on dry open places, roadsides, banks, and 
 often in sandy soil. A very variable plant according to locality, exposure 
 to sunlight, and soil, especially in the flowering shoots and their leaves. 
 From one and the same individual very different looking flowering shoots 
 may be collected, which by an inexperienced observer might easily be 
 considered as belonging to difEerent varieties or species. 

To this species belongs the cultivated variety Lucretia Sister, Gardena, 
 and according to Bailey probably also Windom.
