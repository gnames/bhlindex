62 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Canes more robust, longer, with less hooked stouter prickles; stipules linear-lanceo- 
 late; leaves more pubescent, terminal leaflet longer stalked. Flowering shoots 20-80 cm 
 long, lower leaves 3-foliolate, leaflets ovate, pointed, upper ones simple, ovate, pointed, 
 rounded or cordate at the base. Pedicels longer, stouter, well overtopping the leaves, 
 flowers very large and showy; calyx-lobes ovate with a long often foliaceous tip; petals 2 
 cm long or more, obovate, clawed. Fniit oblong with numerous drupelets. 

This is the cultivated Lucretia. Crosses were made at Geneva between 
 Lucretia and Erie (blackberry), Lucretia and Ancient Briton (blackberry), 
 between Rathbun (blackberry) and (Lucretia x Agawam), and also between 
 Lucretia and Snyder (blackberry).

Stems somewhat ascending but soon decumbent, not very prickly. Leaves light green, 
 teeth of the leaflets, both on sterile and fertile branches, mostly simple, large and broadly 
 rounded, shortly mucronate. 

Central North America; apparently widely spread in western Missouri, 
 Michigan, and Indiana. Here belong the formerly cultivated varieties 
 Bartel, Never Fail, and General Grant. Plants from the southeastern 
 states seem to represent a close and similar variety. To this seems to 
 belong the cultivated variety Premo. 

R. flagellaris var. geophilus Bailey. 

R. geophilus. Blanchard Wzociora 8:148. 1906. 

Stems robust, similar to var. rorihaccus; leaves rather large, more or less pubescent, 
 jagged and ver\' coarsely serrate; also the leaves of the fruiting branches large and very 
 variable in shape, the simple uppermost broadly cordate-ov'ate, often more or less 3-lobed, 
 larger than in most cases. Pedicels stout, long, prickly, overlapping the foliage; calyx, 
 lobes often with long foliaceous often pinnately incised tips; petals obovate, over 2 cm 
 long. Fruit remarkably large. 

Eastern North America; from Maine to Texas. Here belongs the culti- 
 vated variety Mayes. A cross was made at Geneva between Kansas (black 
 raspberry) and Mayes, and between Mayes and Agawam (blackberry).

Robust shrub, similar in habit to var. geophilus, but the leaflets with large, sharp, and 
 deeply cut often falcate teeth or almost lacinate-dentate, lateral leaflets sessile. Flower- 
 ing branches pubescent; leaves lacerate-dentate, pubescent especially on the back, i- to 
 lo-flowered.
