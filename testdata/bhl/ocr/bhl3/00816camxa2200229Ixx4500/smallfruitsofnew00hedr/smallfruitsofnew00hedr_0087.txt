THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 63 

East central North America; Michigan, Indiana. 

R. arizonensis. Focke Spec. i?M6. 3:307. 1914. 

R. oligospermus. Thomber ex Rydberg N. Am. Fl. 22:470. 1913; not Sudre igog. 

Very similar to R. flagellaris; but floral branches only 5-10 cm long, with 3- to s-folio- 
 late leaves, 1-4 cm long, pubescent. Flowers 1-5, pedicels villous and with recurved prickles ; 
 sepals villous tomentose, petals 8-9 mm long. Fruits globose, 10-12 mm across with 
 about 12-25 drupelets. 

Arizona and south to Mexico; first collected by C. G. Pringle in the 
 St. Catalina Mountains, Arizona, in 1881. 

R. enslenii. Tratt. Ros. Monogr. 3:63. 1823. 

This is often cited in connection with R. flagellaris, but it is yet insuf- 
 ficiently known. The original specimen in the Vienna herbarium is a weak 
 plantlet; its exact habitat is not known. Possibly plants grown near Biloxi, 
 Mississippi, may represent this species. 

Rubus arenicola. Blanchard i^/ioJora 8:151. 1906; Bailey Ceu^. i/eW). 1:167. 1023. 

Canes perfectly prostrate, obscurely angular or terete, glabrous, with numerous, slender, 
 recur\-ed prickles. Leaves 3-foliolate, the lower ones o'^ten 5-foliolate, rather regularly 
 and sharply and often doubly toothed, dark green above and paler beneath, almost glabrous 
 on both sides, except for the veins beneath ; lower leaflets sessile, small, middle ones short 
 stalked, obliquely broadly ovate, shortly pointed, terminal leaflet larger and longer stalked, 
 roundish or cordate at the base; on 3-foliolate leaves the lower leaflets oblique or obscurely 
 lobed on the outer side, and the terminal one mostly broadly obovate, suddenly contracted 
 into a short point. Petioles and petiolules slightly pubescent and prickly; stipules narrowly 
 lanceolate, acute. Flowering branches pubescent, sparingly prickly; leaves 3-foliolate, 
 leaflets obovate, obtuse or shortly pointed, doubly toothed. Flowers 5-10 or more, cor\-m- 
 bifomi; pedicels pubescent, sparingly prickly; calyx pubescent, lobes ovate, cuspidate; 
 petals longer, obovate; stamens and pistils numerous. Berries roundish oblong. 

Eastern North America; Nova Scotia to Massachusetts. There are 
 no cultivated forms of this species as yet. 

Rubus plicatifolius. Blanchard Rhodora 8:149. 1906; Bailey Gent. Herb. 1:167. 

1923- 

R.villosus. Alton Hort. Ken: 2:210. 1789; not Thunberg 1784. 

Canes procumbent, terete, glabrous, with scattered, slender, recurved prickles. Leaves 
 5-foliolate, bright green and glabrescent on both sides, except for the veins beneath, sharply 
 and doubly serrately toothed; lower leaflets sessile, obovate, contracted into a more or 
 less long point, terminal one stalked, longer and broader and more ovate, rounded or sub- 
 cordate at the base; petioles long, glabrescent like the petiolules and the midveins, with 
 scattered, recurved prickles; stipules long, lanceolate-linear, acute. Flowering branches 
 slender, pubescent, sparingly prickly; leaves 3-foliolate, finely doubly toothed, paler and 
 pubescent underneath, with close, fine, prominent veins and the blade usually finely depressed 
 or falted between them. Flowers corymbiform, 5-7 or more or less, rather small; pedicels
