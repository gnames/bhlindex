 species. 

Rubus velox. Bailey Gent. Herb. i:i68. 1923. 

Vigorous shrub, canes soon procumbent and creeping on the ground, several feet long, 
 angular and furrowed, pubescent at first, along the angles with scattered, moderately stout, 
 fine, somewhat recurved prickles from a broad base. Leaves 5-foliolate, rather thin, 
 yellowish green, glabrescent above, underneath paler green and finely pubescent, especially 
 along the veins, simply or doubly serrate; leaflets ovate-lanceolate, pointed, roundish or 
 subcordate at the base; lower leaflets subsessile, middle ones stalked, terminal leaflets 
 larger, 7-10 cm long and 5 cm wide or more, more oblong, longer stalked, with about 
 10-12 veins on each side; petioles, rhachis, and midveins pubescent, with several hooked 
 prickles; stipules narrowly linear or subulate. Flowering branches erect, angular like the 
 petioles, and pubescent, sparingly prickly, 15-20 cm long; leaves 3-foliolate, smaller and 
 narrower towards the base, the uppermost simple, sometimes 3-lobed, with a broad, roundish 
 or subcordate base. Flowers 1-4, axillar, pedicels not or scarcely exceeding the leaves, 
 pubescent, almost without prickles. Calyx-lobes pubescent, tomentose inside, ovate, 
 cuspidate, often with a large foliaceus-lobed tip. Petals oblong, 12-15 mâ„¢ long; stamens 
 and pistils numerous. Fruit oblong, 25 mm long or more, black. 

Southwestern United States; Texas. The type of this species is the 
 " blackberry dewberry " McDonald. Sonderegger Earliest comes very 
 near to it as also does Honey Coreless. Dallas has deeper doubly serrate 
 leaflets, very pubescent underneath, and the same is the case with the 
 varieties Early Wonder and Texas Early; their leaflets, however, are shorter 
 and rounder. Other varieties belonging to this species are Spavdding and 
 Sorsby.

Stems prostrate, slender, usually bristly and prickly. Leaves 3- to 5-foliolate, leaflets 
 narrowly ovate to lanceolate, usually persistent, shining green and glabrous. Floral 
 branches short, erect; flowers rather large, solitary or 3-5 or more together, on long, erect 
 pedicels well above the foliage; prickles on stems, petioles and pedicels with a flattened base, 
 more or less hooked. 

About five species, all natives of the southeastern United States. 

Several cultivated varieties belong to this group and no doubt the pomo- 

logical importance of it will increase in the future.
