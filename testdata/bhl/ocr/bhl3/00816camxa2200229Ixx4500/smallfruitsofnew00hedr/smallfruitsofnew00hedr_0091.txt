THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 67 

Running Swamp Blackberry. â€” Stems prostrate, trailing on the ground and rooting at 
 the tip, slender, terete, glabrous, more or less densely beset with slender, recurved bristles, 
 occasionally intermixed with a few stouter prickles. Leaves 3- to 5-foliolate; leaflets firm, 
 dark green above, more or less persistent over the winter, glabrous on both sides, regularly 
 simply or doubly toothed or serrate, obovate, shortly pointed or obtuse, attenuate towards 
 and variously rounded at the base; in 3-foliolate leaves, the lower leaflets short stalked, 
 oblique with lateral lobes, the terminal ones longer stalked and larger, rhombic-obovate. 
 Petioles about as long or longer, glabrous and with recurved bristles, also the petiolules 
 and the midveins; stipules linear-lanceolate, or almost subulate, acuminate. Flowering 
 branches erect, glabrous, sparingly bristl}', 15-30 cm long, leaves 3-foliolate, similar to 
 those of the turions, the uppermost ones simple. Flowers rather small, 5-9 corymbiform 
 and 1-3 lower axillary ones; pedicels 3-5 times as long as the calyx, pubescent and with 
 long, slender, scattered bristles, some of them with glands. Calyx pubescent, lobes ovate- 
 deltoid, cuspidate; petals white, 8 mm long. Berry with about 10-20 glabrous drupelets, 
 dark red or purple. 

Eastern North America; from Nova Scotia south to Georgia, west to 
 Michigan, in damp woods, meadows, mostly in dense carpets. Also this 
 species is rather variable. There occur some very robust forms, larger 
 in all their parts. They have been named var. major; there exist, however, 
 all degrees of intermediate forms. Normally the leaflets are rather obtuse 
 or short pointed; some plants, however, have them decidedly pointed. 
 The most pronounced of them has been named R. hispidus var. blanchardi- 
 aniis Bailey. It is a native of southern Vermont. Besides these forms, 
 Blanchard segregated three allied species, which he found in Vermont. 

Rubus cubitans. Blanchard, Torreya (>:ii\?>. 1906. 

Plants not bristly nor glandular; leaves s-foliolate, glabrous; leaflets naiTowly oval 
 to oval, wedge-shaped or at least narrowed towards the base. 

Rubus trifrons. Blanchard .4 );i(?r. /?o/. 11: 11. 1906. 

New canes ascending or erect, bristly, without prickles; plants more or less glandular. 
 Leaves mostly- 3-foliolate. 

Rubus jacens. Blanchard Torreya 6:147. 1906. 

R. semierectiis. Blanchard Rhodora 8:156. 1906. 

New canes ascending or erect, bristly and prickly; leaves mostly 5-foliolate; pedicels 
 often with a few stalked glands. 

Rydberg considers the last three as hybrids of R. hispidus with R. 
 vermontanus Blanch., one of the Setosi group. The latter, however, may 
 perhaps be a hybrid with R. plicatifoliiis. Besides these there are other 
 hybrids recorded with R. argutiis, R. allegheniensis, and R. canadensis. 
 Another interesting- hybrid, R. hispidus xR. pubescens, was found in a wood 
 near Lake Ontario, east of Youngstown:
