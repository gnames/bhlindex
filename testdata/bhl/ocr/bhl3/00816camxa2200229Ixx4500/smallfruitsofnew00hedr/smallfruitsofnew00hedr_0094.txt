green or reddish color ; lateral and terminal leaflets long stalked, long acuminate or suddenly 
 contracted into a long point. Flowering branches pale, slightly pubescent; inflorescence 
 racemose; peduncle and pedicels slender, patent like the calyx, adpressedly puberulous, 
 Kot glandular. 

So far no horticultural varieties have been developed from this series, 
 but some of the species offer possibilities.

Thornless or Mountain Blackberry. â€” Robust shrub, 1.5-4 m high; canes stout, erect, 
 slightly arching at the top, angled and furrowed, brownish, glabrous, usually unanned 
 or with a few straight prickles; branching the first year. Leaves 5-foliolate, large; petiole 
 and petiolules glabrous, usually brownish, unarmed, or rarely with a few prickles; stipules 
 lanceolate-subulate; leaflets all, especially the terminal one, long stalked, ovate-lanceolate 
 contracted into a long point, more or less cordate at the base, the terminal leaflet broader 
 and longer, green above and paler underneath, glabrous on both sides, simply or doubly 
 serrate, the teeth acute, directed forward; veins prominent underneath, pale or reddish. 
 Flowering branches slender, yellowish green; leaves 3-foliolate, leaflets obliquely ovate or 
 rhomboid-ovate, i^ointed, sharply irregularly serrate; petioles often shghtly pubescent. 
 Flowers in long lax racemes 8-15 cm long; peduncle and pedicels slender, unarmed, finely 
 pubescent ; lower bracts foliaceous, simple, obovate, upper bracts lanceolate, acute, pubes- 
 cent; pedicels up to 6 cm long, slender, almost filiform, spreading; calyx minutely pubescent, 
 lobes ovate, decidedly cuspidate, white tomentose inside; petals longer, 10-15 "^n^. obovate, 
 clawed at the base; stamens and pistils numerous, filaments slender. Fruit roundish, 
 black, sour or even bitterish, ripening late, drupelets numerous, rather large, glabrous. 

Eastern North America; from Newfoundland west to Wisconsin, and 
 southward in the mountains to North Carolina. The accounts about the 
 quality of the fruit vary. Bailey, in Evolution of our Native Fruits, page 
 324, says they are " quite palatable and sweet to a hungry man." Again, 
 " that the fruit becomes ripe and black in September. The berries are 
 large, long and slender and very sweet, lacking the sharply acid or bitterish 
 quality of the berries of the lower mountains."
