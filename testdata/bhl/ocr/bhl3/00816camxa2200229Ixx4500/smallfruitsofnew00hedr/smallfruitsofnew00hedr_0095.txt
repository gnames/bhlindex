Stems erect, rather slender, 1-1.5 m high, angled and furrowed, brow,Ti, glabrous, with 
 rather numerous, scattered, retrorse or straight, slender prickles along the angles. Leaves 
 of the turions s-foliolate; petioles, petiolules and midveins glabrous with slender retrorse 
 prickles; leaflets oval or ovate, long taper-pointed, dark green, slightly paler beneath, 
 glabrous or aknost so, finely and sharply doubly serrate; terminal leaflet usually rounded 
 at the base, long stalked, the others mostly acute at the base, shorter stalked or the lowest 
 ahnost sessile. Flowering branches slender, paler, slightly pubescent and with scattered, 
 slender, retrorse prickles; leaves 3-foliolate, the upper ones simple, petioles and sometimes 
 the veins at the back puberulous; leaflets oval or obovate, less pointed and coarser toothed. 
 Flowers in racemes, the lower a.xillar, peduncle pubescent and prickly, pedicels spreading, 
 filiform, pubescent and with a few very slender prickles; bracts lanceolate. Calyx finely 
 pubescent, lobes ovate, shortly cuspidate; petals oval, 10-13 rnm long. Fruit nearly 
 globular or oblong, black and sweet.

Rubus amicalis. Blanchard Rhodora 13:56. 191 1; Rydberg iV. Am. Fl. 22:468. 
 1913; Bailey Gent. Herb. 1:183. 1923. 

R. amabilis. Blanchard Rhodora 8:173. 1906; not Focke 1905. 

Erect, 1-2 m high, canes angled and furrowed, brown, with scattered straight prickles. 
 Leaves of the turions s-foliolate; petioles and petiolules with minute recurved prickles or 
 unarmed; leaflets obovate, or oblanceolate, long taper pointed, roundish or pointed at 
 the base, finely doubly serrate, rather thick, dark green and shining above, when young 
 with a few scattered hairs, paler and glabrous on the back; the middle one longer stalked 
 than the lateral ones, the lowest almost sessile. Flowering branches with smaller, more 
 obtuse 3-foliolate leaves. Flowers racemose, pubescent; pedicels slender, pubescent; 
 bracts lanceolate; calyx almost glabrous, lobes ovate, mucronate, tomentose inside; petals 
 white, 12-18 mm long. Fruits variable, small, oblong, black. 

Eastern North America; from Nova Scotia to Maine. 
 Blanchard's specimens of R. amicalis are very variable, some come near 
 R. canadensis, some are nearer R. elegantulus; but this species should cer- 
 tainly not be included under R. canadensis, which is a very distinct species. 
 There occur forms closely resembling this species with strong deltoid prickles 
 and with the leaflets softly pubescent beneath. They may be hybrid 
 forms with R. allegheniensis or some ally of this species. 

R. amicalis was crossed at Geneva with the raspberries Erskine Park 
 and Smith (I).
