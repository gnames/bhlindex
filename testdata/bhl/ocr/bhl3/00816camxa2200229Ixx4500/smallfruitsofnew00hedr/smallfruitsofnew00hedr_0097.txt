THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 73 

when young, and with a few scattered glands below, more or less villous and glandular on 
 the growing point, usually brown and glabrous when old, armed with stout, flat, straight 
 or slightly cur\^ed prickles; often branching the first year. Leaves of the turions 
 with petioles and petiolules more or less pubescent or villous, glandular and prickly, 
 the prickles spreading or recurved, extending along the midveins; stipules subulate, 
 glandular ciliate; leaflets 5, all stalked, especially the terminal one, ovate, abruptly con- 
 tracted into a rather long point, cordate or rounded at the base, the terminal one larger 
 and much broader, 5-15 cm long or more, dark green and more or less hairy above, paler 
 and densely velvety pubescent beneath, chiefly along the veins. Flowering branches 
 10-30 cm long, villous, prickly and more abundantly glandular; leaves 3-foliolate, lower 
 leaflets oblique, or obscurely lobed, sessile, all acute, but less acuminate; uppermost leaves 
 simple. Flowers numerous, about 20, in a cylindrical raceme, 10-20 cm long, the lower ones 
 leafy bracted and with branched pedicels ; peduncle or rhachis and pedicels densely villous, 
 glandiilar and prickly; bracts ovate or lanceolate, 5-10 mm long; pedicels slender, patent, 
 2-4 cm long; calj^x pubescent and glandular, green, lobes ovate to lanceolate-ovate, cuspi- 
 date, white tomentose inside; petals oval or elliptical, 12-15 iâ„¢n long. Fruit oblong or 
 elongate, black, sweet, with ntimerous glabrous drupelets. 

Eastern North America; from Nova Scotia to North Carolina, Arkansas, 
 and Illinois. A fairly constant and easily recognized species; its variations 
 extend to the size and shape of the leaves, the length of the racemes, and 
 the degree of glandtilosity on stems, petioles, and petiolules. The inflores- 
 cence is always glandular; this and the stalked, velvety pubescent leaflets 
 always help to distinguish it. With its large white flowers, borne in long 
 racemes, and its handsome leaves, it is an attractive shrub. Plants grow- 
 ing in the deep shade of the woods have much thinner and paler leaves and 
 stems. R. allegheniensis was crossed at Geneva with the blackberry 
 Erskine Park.

Rather dwarf, ascending, glabrous, with scattered gland-tipped hairs, armed with 
 slender hooked prickles from a broadened base. Leaves 5-foKolate, when young pubescent 
 beneath; leaflets narrowly ovate or obovate, acuminate, rather coarsely simply toothed; 
 petioles and especially the petiolules prickly. Flowers in slender long racemes; bracts 
 often foliaceous; pedicels very glandular; petals oblong. Fruit globose, sweet, black, with 
 a few drupelets. 

Northeastern United States; Vermont. According to Rydberg, N. Am. 
 Fl. 22:469, this is a hybrid between R. elegantulus and R. nigrohaccus 
 {R. allegheniensis). The same view is held by Brainerd and Peitersen, 
 17. Sta. Bui. 217:56, 57. 1920. Plants from the type locality trans- 
 planted to the grounds of the Experiment Station, Burlington, Vermont, 
 developed into large, robust shrubs.
