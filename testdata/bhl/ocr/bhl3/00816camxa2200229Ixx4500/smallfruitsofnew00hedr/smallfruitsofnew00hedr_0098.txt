THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

From R. allegheniensis is derived a niimber of the most valued high- 
 bush blackberries, which may be called for horticultural purposes the big- 
 cluster varieties. The varieties descending from R. allegheniensis pure, 
 or perhaps with some slight, scarcely traceable mixture of an allied species, 
 are always easily recognized by their vigorous growth, the rather long- 
 stalked lateral leaflets, and the mostly long racemose inflorescence, which 
 is more or less densely covered with staUced glands. The berries are mostly 
 more elongate than roundish. 

Here belong Agawam, Albro, Ancient Briton, Eldorado, Erskine Park, 
 Snyder, and Taylor. 

Some varieties seem to be crosses between R. allegheniensis and R. 
 frondosus. In these the lateral leaflets are shorter stalked, the terminal 
 leaflets are rounder and less deeply cordate ; the inflorescence bears a larger 
 number of leaf-like bracts, and is sparingly glandular. Here belong the 
 varieties Ambrosia, Dorchester, and Early Mammoth. 

A few other varieties are probably hybrids between R. allegheniensis 
 and R. pergratus, with canes and leaves much like R. allegheniensis, inflores- 
 cence villous, pubescent, and gland vilar, more leafy bracted and leaf- 
 lets deeper toothed; pedicels more or less prickly. Here belongs Stone 
 Hardy. 

Rubus alumnus. Bailey Gent. Herb, iiigi. 1923. 

Robust plant, with erect canes, about 2 m high, pubescent and glandular when young, 
 glabrous when old, angular and with scattered, stout, straight or slightly curved prickles 
 with a flat base. Leaves 3- to 5-foliolate, slightly pubescent above and softly pubescent 
 underneath; leaflets broadly elliptic-ovate, acute or shortly pointed, coarsely doubly serrate; 
 the terminal one longer stalked and larger, 8-12 cm long. Petiole, petiolules, and mid- 
 veins strongly prickly and with stalked glands. Flowering shoots angular, prickly, leafy; 
 the lower leaves 3-foliolate, the upper ones simple, all bearing flowers in their axils, hence 
 the raceme very foliaceous; leaflets with large, simple, lanceolate teeth; lower pedicels 
 remote, long, erect, the upper ones approximate and shorter, rising from smaller bracts, all 
 pubescent, glandular, and with scattered, spreading prickles. Flowers large and showy, 
 3~4 cm across; calyx-lobes ovate, shortly cuspidate; petals broadly obovate. Fruits large 
 30-35 mm long and 18 mm in diameter, very sweet. 

Central United States; western Missouri; in rich open woods. In 
 Jackson County, Missouri, the wild fruits are sold on the markets in quanti- 
 ties and the plants are also taken into cultivation. 

On account of its leafy inflorescence Bailey places this fine and distinct 
 species among the " Frondosi." However, we prefer to associate it with the 
 " Alleghenienses " for its glandular inflorescence.
