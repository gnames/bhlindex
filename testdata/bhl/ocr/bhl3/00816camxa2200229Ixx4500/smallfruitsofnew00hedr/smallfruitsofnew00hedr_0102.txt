unarmed; flowers rather small for the group; cal>Tc pubescent or hirsute, lobes ovate- 
 lanceolate, shortly cuspidate; petals longer, roundish. Fruit subglobose, drupelets few, 
 rather large. 

Northeastern United States; Vermont. There are no cultivated 
 varieties. 

Another species probably of the Argutus group has been segregated as

Rubus louisianus. Berger n. sp. 

Swampberry. â€” Canes erect, 1-2 m high, sharply angled and deeply furrowed, downy 
 when 3'oung, glabrous later on, green or greenish brown, along the angles with scattered, 
 middle sized or large straight or hooked prickles. Petioles rather stout, like the petiolules 
 pubescent or villous and with scattered, hooked prickles which extend to the midveins; 
 stipules subulate, ciliate; leaflets 5, narrowly lanceolate or oblanceolate, rather long pointed 
 and somewhat narrower toward the base, bright dull green above, paler and pubescent under- 
 neath, rather regularly and sharply simply or doubly serrate; the terminal leaflet larger, 
 longer pointed and longer stalked, roimdish or even subcordate at the base, middle ones 
 shortly stalked and lower ones sessile, all more or less acute at the base. Fruiting racemes 
 pubescent, with 7-8 or more erect pedicels, pubescent and with a few hooked prickles; 
 leaves 3-foliolate, leaflets cuneate at the base, the upper ones simple ovate-deltoid, shortly 
 stalked. Calyx pubescent, lobes ovate-deltoid, tomentose inside. Fruit cylindrical with 
 numerous small drupelets, whitish, sweet. 

Southeastern United States; South Carolina and Louisiana, on damp 
 roadsides, in ravines, known as Swampberry.

 Iceberg is possibly the same renamed. It is too tender for the North, 
 usually freezing back.
