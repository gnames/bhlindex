Robust shrub, canes erect or recurved, 1-2 m high, angular at first, more or less terete 
 later on, brown and glabrous, with a few scattered, straight or slightly recurved prickles 
 from a broadened base. Leaves mostly 5-foliolate; petioles rather stout, finely pubescent 
 or glabrescent, petiolules more or less villous, scattered hooked prickles extending to the 
 midveins of the larger leaflets ; stipules linear-lanceolate, cilia te ; lower leaflets sessile, obliquely 
 ovate, shortly pointed, lateral ones shortly stalked, larger, broadly ovate, and abruptly 
 pointed, terminal leaflet distinctly stalked, cordate, broadly ovate or roundish ovate, 
 abruptly acuminate, 8-14 cm long and 6-10 cm wide; rather firm, dark green above and 
 glabrous when mature, green and densely velvety pubescent underneath ; doubly serrately 
 toothed, teeth rather large and broad, mucronate. Flowering shoots very leafy, pubescent, 
 sparingly prickly; prickles slender, recurved; lower leaves 3-foliolate, upper ones simple; 
 stipules lanceolate, acute; leaflets 3-7 cm long, very variable, ovate or obovate, acute or 
 roundish or subcordate at the base, shortly pointed and coarsely toothed, velvety pubescent 
 underneath. Inflorescence short corymbiform, or with a few lower axillary pedicels; 
 bracts lanceolate, villous; pedicels pubescent, rarely with a few prickles. Calyx green, 
 pubescent; lobes ovate, more or less cuspidate, white tomentose inside; petals broadly 
 oboval, about 10 mm long, white. Fruit black, roundish, sweet, pulpy; drupelets and 
 seeds large. 

Northeastern and central United States; from Massachusetts to Virginia 
 in the South, to Kansas in the West and Ontario in the North, according 
 to Rydberg, I.e. 

R. frondosus is one of the parents of several important varieties of the 
 big cluster blackberries in combination either with R. allcgheniensis or with 
 R. pergratus. There seem to be no pure-bred varieties of R. frondosus. 

R. brainerdi, Rydberg N. Am. Fl. 22:467. 1913; Brainerd & Peiter-

 1900; not R. nigrobaccus var. sativus Bailey 1898, is similar to R. fron- 
 dosus, but a much lower shrub, 0.3-0.6 cm high; with weaker canes and 
 only sparingly prickly. It is perhaps nothing more than a dwarfed form of 
 R. frondosus.
