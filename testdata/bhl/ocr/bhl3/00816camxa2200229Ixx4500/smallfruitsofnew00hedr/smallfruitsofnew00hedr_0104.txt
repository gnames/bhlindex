8o THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

weak prickles. Petioles glabrous, petioMes pubescent, both beset with scattered, hooked 
 prickles; stipules linear-lanceolate. Leaflets 3-5, the lowest sessile, obliquely ovate, acutish 
 at both ends; the lateral ones stalked, broader, ovate, abruptly pointed, roundish at the 
 base; the terminal leaflet cordate-ovate, suddenly contracted into a prolonged point; 
 in 3-foliolate leaves the lateral leaflets broad and large with a lower lobe; rather firm in 
 texture, glabrous and dark green above, slightly paler green and velvety pubescent under- 
 neath ; doubly serrately toothed, teeth rather large and broad, mucronate, like in R. frondo- 
 sus. Flowering branches pubescent, sparingly prickly; lower leaves 3-foliolate, with 
 obovate-cuneate, obtuse leaflets ; the upper ones simple, the lower ones broadly lanceolate, 
 the uppermost narrowly lanceolate, pointed at the base and long acuminate, with large 
 simple or double teeth, all velvety pubescent underneath. Flowers not very numerous, in 
 a leafy, pubescent or villous corymb; pedicels slender, occasionally prickly; calyx pubes- 
 cent, lobes ovate, cuspidate, white tomentose inside; petals 12-15 nini long, elliptic, white. 
 Fruit elongate, 10-15 nim long, black, sweet. 

Northeastern United States; from Maine to northern New York. 
 Differs from R. frondosus chiefly in less roundish leaves and in the upper 
 leafy bracts being more pointed and deeper serrate. 

R. jeckylanus, Blanchard Rhodora 8:177. 1906, is considered by 
 most writers as a synonym of R. reciirvans. Blanchard's specimens seem 
 to represent intermediate forms connecting in some way R. frondosus 
 and R. recurvans; they have, however, a more villous inflorescence than both, 
 the bract leaves of the former, and the leaves of the turions of the latter. 

R. recurvans and a plant grown as R. jeckylanus were both crossed with 
 Erskine Park (blackberry), and also with Snyder at Geneva. 

Rubus arundelanus. Blanchard i?/jodora 8: 176. 1906. 

Canes angular when yovmg, terete when old, with rather numerous and slender, straight, 
 retrorse prickles from a broader base. Petioles slightly pubescent, the petiolules villous, 
 both beset with numerous small hooked prickles; stipules linear or subulate-lanceolate. 
 Leaves 5-foliolate, rather thin and light green on both sides, with scattered single hairs or 
 glabrescent above, softly pubescent beneath, sharply and unequally doubly toothed, 
 the teeth narrow and sharp; lower leaflets sessile, obliquely lanceolate or oblanceolate, 
 acuminate, attenuate at the base; lateral leaflets longer stalked, larger and broader, sub- 
 cordate at the base and suddenly contracted into a long point; terminal leaflet very long 
 stalked, usually subcordate, ovate, long pointed, lobately doubly toothed, in the upper 
 half, sometimes broader and ovate-deltoid, 7-10 cm long and 5-6 cm wide. Flowering 
 branches pubescent, sparingly prickly ; the leaves with scattered hairs above and pubescent 
 at the back, extremely variable, mostly 3-foliolate, but often the lateral ones deeply lobate 
 and thus seemingly 5-foliolate, sometimes also the terminal leaflet deeply 3-lobed; leaflets 
 of the lower leaves usually more rounded, those of the upper ones much narrower, all 
 attenuate at the base and deeply, often lobately doubly toothed; the uppermost leaves or 
 leafy bracts narrowly lanceolate, acuminate. Flowers about 6-8, in a short corymb with
