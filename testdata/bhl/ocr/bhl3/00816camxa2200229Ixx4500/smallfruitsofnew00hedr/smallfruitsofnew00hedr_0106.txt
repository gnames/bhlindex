g2 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

the angles, compressed, curved. Leaves of the turions mostly 3-foliolate but also s-foliolate, 
 elliptic, acute, not acuminate, dark green, paler underneath, pubescent along the veins. 
 Flowering branches short, scarcely 5 cm long, pubescent, prickly; lower leaflets 3-foliolate, 
 upper ones simple; terminal leaflet about ovate, obtuse or somewhat pointed, simple or 
 doubly coarsely serrate, dark green and glabrous or almost above, paler underneath and 
 pubescent at least on the veins; petioles sparingly pubescent. Flowers rather large, 
 usually 3-6 or more together, the lower ones axillary, the upper ones from small lanceolate 
 bracts, peduncle and pedicels more or less finely pubescent, pedicels 1.5-2 cm long; calyx 
 almost glabrous or finely pubescent, whitish tomentose inside; petals roundish, 15 mm 
 long. Fruit roimdish with numerous drupelets. 

Southeastern United States; from South Carolina to Tennessee, Georgia, 
 Alabama, and Mississippi (Bailey). This plant was first collected by 
 Enslen and described by Trattinick, but no exact locality was given. It 
 seems to grow erect or somewhat climbing, reaching 8-10 feet, in low wood- 
 lands and swamps. R. rhodophyllus, Rydberg in Small Fl. Southeast. 

U. S. 518. 1903, and R. persistens, Rydberg I.e. 519, belong to this 
 same species according to Bailey. R. betidiJoUus, Small Fl. Southeast. 

U. S. 518. 1903, is an allied but distinct, small-leaved species. It occurs 
 in swamps in Alabama. It ife a slender, thin-leaved plant. 

Neither R. floridus nor R. betidifolius have so far any pomological 
 interest; but the former is very productive and may perhaps yield some 
 valuable varieties for the South. 

Series 13. Fruticosi. Ba.iley Gent. Herb. 1:194. 1923. 

More or less robust brambles, with stout angular, variously armed biennial canes. 
 Leaves wintergreen or at least more or less persistent, 3- to 5-foliolate. Inflorescence 
 panicled, many flowered. 

Under this group are comprised all the European blackberries, as 
 far as they have been introduced into the United States, and are culti- 
 vated as fruit or ornamental plants. The European brambles of this 
 series are extremely numerous, but besides those enumerated below they 
 are of no interest to the pomologist, at least at present. 

A. Plants prickly 

B. Leaflets much divided in narrow segments R. laciniatus 

BB. Leaflets not divided, at most somewhat lobed, white tomentose underneath 

C. Inflorescence with very broad prickles R. rusticanns 

CC. Inflorescence prickly, but prickles with less broad base R. procerus 

AA. Plants unarmed, white felty throughout R. idmifolius var. inermis
