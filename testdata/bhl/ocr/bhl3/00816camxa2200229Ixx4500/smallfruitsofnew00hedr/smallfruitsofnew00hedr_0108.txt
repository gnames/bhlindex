84 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

under R. idmifoliiis Focke. A double-flowered, rather ornamental form 
 {R. rusticaniis flore pleno) is cultivated in collections, but it is rather tender 
 and apt to suffer severely in our winters. It is sometimes found under the 
 names R. spectabilis flore pleiw and R. fruticosus flore albo pleno. 

According to the late R. A. Rolfe, Kew, R. rusticaniis is one of the 
 parents of the ciiltivated variety Mahdi, which was raised by Messrs. J. 
 Veitch & Sons, at Langley, from the raspberry Belle de Fontenay crossed 
 with the blackberry common in hedges at Langley. 

The variety Mahdi has been crossed repeatedly at this Station with 
 various other varieties. The seedlings of a cross between Mahdi and Herbert 
 (raspberry) were partly like raspberry with pinnately 5-f oliolate leaves and 
 partly like the blackberry in habit. The seedlings of Mahdi x Lucretia are 
 of dewberry habit with the leaves digitately 3- to 5-f oliolate. Other crosses 
 were Mahdi x (Mahdi x Lucretia), Mahdi x Agawam, Mahdi x Phenomenal, 
 Mahdi x Mersereau, and Mahdi x Rubus odoratus. None of these crosses 
 are of any pomological value.

A huge, very thorny blackberry; canes several meters long and 3-4 cm thick, angled 
 and furrowed, thinly downy or pubescent when young, soon becoming glabrous; prickles 
 along the angles, numerous, long, and stout, straight or mostly hooked and compressed. 
 Petioles stout, longer than the lower leaflets, glabrescent, \vith many smaller, broad-based, 
 hooked prickles; stipules subular. Leaflets 5, rather firm, wintergreen, dark green above 
 and with dense adpressed whitish felt underneath, sharply simply or in the upper half 
 doubly serrate, teeth ovate, shortly mucronate; leaflets obovate, shortly pointed or con- 
 tracted into a short point, the tenninal one rovmdish obovate, with a long petiolule, lateral 
 ones smaller, narrower, shorter stalked, like the still smaller, almost sessile lower ones some- 
 what oblique; petiolules and midveins pubescent and very prickly. Inflorescence large, 
 panicled, white tomentose and prickly; flowers numerous, 25 mm across; stamens and pistils 
 niimerous. Fruit black, firm, edible. 

Western Europe; France and along the Rhine. 

To this species belongs the cultivated variety Theodor Reimers, origi- 
 nated in 1889 by Garteninspector Reimers at Hamburg, now widely 
 cultivated in Germany, and introduced into the United States and 
 re-christened as Himalaya. Hybrids were raised at Geneva between the 
 Himalaya and Lucretia (dewberry). Strawberry Flavored blackberry is a 
 hybrid of the Himalaya and the Cuthbert raspberry. Crosses were made 
 at Geneva between Strawberry Flavored and Lucretia (dewberry) and 
 also with Sn^^der (blackberry).
