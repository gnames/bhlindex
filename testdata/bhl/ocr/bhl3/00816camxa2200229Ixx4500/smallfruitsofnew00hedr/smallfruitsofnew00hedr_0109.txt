A robust thornless blackberry ; canes obtusely angled, more or less densely downy from 
 grayish stellate hairs. Petioles shorter than the lower leaflets, unanned and downy like 
 the canes, stipules subulate; leaflets 3-5, rather firm in texture, green and mostly glabrous 
 above, beneath with adpressed fine whitish felt, finely simply or doubly serrate, usually more 
 irregularly so near the top of the temiinal leaflets or on the outer margin of the lower ones, 
 which are obliquely ovate and sometimes obscurely lobed, acute or roundish at the base 
 and with a short sharp point; terminal leaflet longer, obovate-oblong, pointed from the upper 
 third, rounded at the base. Inflorescence panicled. Berries black, edible. 

This is a sport of a widely-spread and very variable European bramble, 
 known in European gardens more than lOO years. It was introduced into 
 the United States and put in trade by Luther Burbank under the varietal 
 names Santa Rosa, Sebastopol, and Cory Thornless, which are identical 
 with Willdenow's herbarium type specimens.
