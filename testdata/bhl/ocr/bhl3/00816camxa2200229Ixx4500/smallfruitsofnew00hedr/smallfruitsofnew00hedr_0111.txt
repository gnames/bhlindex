 reddish purple, with long, slender, white prickles; fruit medium, round, light red, juicy, mild. 
 Allsmeyer. i. Wis. Sta. Bui. 72:18. 1898. 

A seedling red raspberry sent to the Wisconsin Experiment Station in 1897 by E. C. 
 Allsmeyer, DeForest, Wisconsin. Plants vigorous, productive; fruit below medium in size,

Alpine, i. Prince Pom. Man. 2:169. 1832. 

William R. Prince imported this variety, the Cretan Red, and a flesh-colored 
 raspberry from the Mediterranean previous to 1832. He believed the three to be closely 
 related, being similar to the Antwerps but having fewer prickles. Fruit of good size with 
 a high and peculiar flavor; season June until September. 

Amelioree Congy. i. Rev. Hort. 88. 1900. 

This autumn-fruiting variety was raised from seed of Four Seasons Red in 1886 by M. 
 Congy, chief of fruit culture of the province of Ferrieres-en-Brie, France. Plants very 
 vigorous, productive; canes purple; leaves large, thick; fruits large, blunt-conic, light 
 red ; quality excellent. 

American Red. i. Prince Cai. 1771. 2. Downing Fr. Trees Am. 515. 1845. 

Before improved varieties of the red raspberry were introduced, the native red was 
 cultivated considerably, and although inferior to the European sorts its greater hardiness 
 made it desirable. The Common Red and the English Red Cane have been incorrectly 
 given as synonjmis of American Red, but both are distinct varieties as will be seen in the 
 discussions of these sorts. 

Areola, i. S. Dak. Sia. Bui. 104:285. 1907. 

A wild, red raspberry found near Areola, Saskatchewan, Canada, and used as a parent

 Station. Plants dwarfish; fruit variable in size and quality.

Arnold's No. j. 2. Horticulturist 2^: 2^^. 1869. 

Originated with Charles Arnold, Paris, Ontario, and sent out by him in 1868. Said to 
 be a cross between a white form of R. occidentalis and a fall-bearing variety of R. idaeus. 
 Plants strong, spreading, with many slender laterals; suckers few; fruit medium in size, 
 roimdish conical, pale lemon-yellow changing to light orange; flesh soft, juicy; flavor good.

Of the same origin as the preceding variety, and the best known of Arnold's seedlings. 
 Plants vigorous, branching, moderately productive; canes dark purple, with numerous 
 stout, slightly purple prickles; suckers excessively; fruit large, red, about the size and shape 
 of Philadelphia but of superior flavor; late, autumn-bearing.
