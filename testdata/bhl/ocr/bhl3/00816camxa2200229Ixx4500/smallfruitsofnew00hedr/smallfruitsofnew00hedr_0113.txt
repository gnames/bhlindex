Baiunforth's Seedling. 2. Flor. & Pom. 185, fig. 1880. 

This variety was selected from a lot of seedlings of Fillbasket about 1865 by John 
 Baumforth, Pontefract, England. It was distributed about 1880, and is still occasionally

 vigor, and productiveness of plant it surpasses its parent; the berries ripen ten days 
 earlier; canes numerous, stout, spreading, glaucous, glabrous; prickles numerous, stout; 
 fruit large, round or somewhat flattened, soft and juicy, rather acid; good.

 fruit conic; drupelets small, very firm, sweet.
