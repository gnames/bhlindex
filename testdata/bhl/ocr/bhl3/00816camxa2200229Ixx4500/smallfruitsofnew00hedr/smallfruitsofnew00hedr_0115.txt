Wilmington. 4. Horticulturist 30:306. 1875. 

This old variety is said to have originated about 1870 with a Mr. Miller, also the 
 originator of the Miller raspberry, who lived by Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, 
 Delaware. At first it was known as Wilmington, and later was sent out by Edward Tatnall 
 of Wilmington as Susqueco, the Indian name of the stream. It came, however, to be 
 generally known as Brandywine, and uiider that name became one of the leading market 
 varieties of its time. The stock was badly mixed as large quantities of Bristol were sold 
 as Brandywine. It was placed in the fruit list of the American Pomological Society in 
 1877, and still remains there. Plants upright, rather weak, not hardy, and unproductive; 
 suckers freely; canes reddish brown, with thin bloom; prickles none; fruit small, round, 
 bright scarlet; flesh firm, juicy, rather insipid; quality fair; early midseason.
