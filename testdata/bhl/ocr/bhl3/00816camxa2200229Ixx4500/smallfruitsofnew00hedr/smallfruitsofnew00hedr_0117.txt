Cardinal is a pvirple raspberry which can be grown farther north and farther south 
 than any other of its kind. Perhaps no other raspberry can be grown as far south. The 
 plants are verj- productive, vigorous, and healthy, but the variety is not as much grown 
 as either Columbian or Shaffer, in localities where purple sorts are commonly planted. It 
 is a valuable sort for the central west. On the grounds of this Station the canes do not 
 sucker but propagate from tips from which they root rather reluctantly. Old plants 
 sometimes send out suckers. Cardinal originated with A. H. Griesa, Lawrence, Kansas, 
 in 1888, and was introduced by him about 1891 under the temporary name Griesa. The 
 variety is supposed to have come from a seed of Shaffer. It was added to the American 
 Pomological Societj^'s recommended list of fruits in 1909. 

Plants vigorous, spreading, hardy, productive, contract mosaic slowly; propagated 
 usually from tips; canes stocky, reddish green, dull, very glaucous; prickles small, slender, 
 few, red at the tips; leaflets 3-5, roundish oval, often lobed, dull, rugose, with serrate 
 margins; petiole with short prickles, glabrous, glaucous. Flowers late; pedicels prickly, 
 glandular, almost glabrous; calyx prickly. Fruit very late, picks easily; medium in size, 
 broadly hemispherical, dark purple, dull, with hea\^'^ bloom; torus nearly smooth, roundish, 
 releasing the berry readily; flesh juicy, finn but tender, sweet, aromatic, resembling in 
 flavor the red raspberry ; quality good to ver\' good. 

Carleton. i. A'. Y. Sta. Bui. 278:116. 1906. 

Received at this Station about 1896 from J. Craig, Ottawa, Canada. Plants moderately 
 vigorous, hardy, productive; fruit medium in size; drupelets large, inclined to crumble; 
 flavor and quality good. 

Caroline. Idaeiis x Occidentalis. 1. Cult, c' Count. Gent. 43:1^1-. 1878. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 
 63:69. 1893. 
 Caroline originated with S. P. Carpenter, New Rochelle, New York, in 1877, and is 
 supposed to be a seedling of Orange crossed by a Golden Cap. For a number of years 
 Caroline was popular as a home berry because of the high quality and beautiful orange 
 color of the fi-uit. It may be propagated either by suckers or by tips. The American 
 Pomological Society placed Caroline in its catalog in 1881 where it still remains. Plants 
 vigorous, upright, hardy and verj' productive; canes light colored, stocky, with few, slender, 
 green prickles; fruit of medium size, roundish oblate, of orange-pink color, changing to a 
 salmon tinge when fully ripe, juicy, soft ; verj' good in flavor and quality.

 Pcnn. & Hort. Sci. 3:24. 1922. 
 Described by A. S. Fuller in the American Horticultural Annual for 1870 as an old 
 English variety almost out of cultivation in this country. It is still grown somewhat in 
 England. Canes strong with purplish spines; leaves variegated with white; fruit large, 
 blunt-conical, deep scarlet, with slight bloom; drupelets medium compact; flesh rather firm, 
 moderately juicy, sweet; good.
