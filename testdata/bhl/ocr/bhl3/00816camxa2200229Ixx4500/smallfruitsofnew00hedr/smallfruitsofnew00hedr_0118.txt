94 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Cassel. 1. Can. Exp. Farms Rpt. io8 igoo. 

On trial at the Dominion Experimental Farm, Ottawa, Ontario, in 1900. Berries 
 described as of medium size and quality; midseason. 

Catawissa. Occidentalis x Strigosus. i. U. S. Pat. Off. Rpt. 318. 1854. 2. Mag. Hort. 
 21:315. 1855. 
 Catawissa originated as a chance seedling in the graveyard of a Quaker meeting- 
 house in the village of Catawissa, Columbia County, Pennsylvania. It attracted the 
 attention of a caretaker who observed it bearing fruit in the fall. The plant was removed 
 to his garden and thence to that of Joshua Pierce, Washington, D. C, who introduced it in 
 1854. The strong, branching canes seldom sucker and the tips root only with difficulty. 
 Plants vigorous, very productive and somewhat tender; prickles few; fruit medium in size, 
 flattened, dark reddish purple, covered with a thick bloom, soft, juicy, sprightly; good; 
 midseason, autumn-fruiting. Catawissa was placed in the fruit catalog of the American 
 Pomological Society in 1867 and removed in 1883. 

Cavalier, i. 5. Dak. Sta. Bui. 104:286. 1907. 

A native red raspberry obtained by Prof. N. E. Hansen, Brookings, South Dakota, 
 from Cavalier County, North Dakota, and used by him as a parent in breeding hardy 
 varieties. Plants vigorous, suckering freely; fruit of good quality.

Ca3mga is the outcome of an effort at the New York State Agricultural Experiment 
 Station to secure a variety to precede Cuthbert, that standard sort being too late in season 
 for many northern markets. The plants of Cayuga are quite as vigorous as those of Cuth- 
 bert, with which it must compete and be compared, and are much more productive, great 
 productiveness being the most remarkable attribute of this new raspberry. The berries 
 are much like those of Cuthbert in size, color, and flavor. In shape they are a little less 
 conic than the well-known fruits of Cuthbert. The drupelets, however, are larger and hence 
 the berries do not seem to be so seedy. The suckers are numerous and plants can be 
 propagated rapidly. The season is a few days or a wedk before that of Cuthbert. It 
 promises to become a valuable sort for commercial canning. Cayuga was originated by 
 the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, Geneva, New York, in 19 11 as a 
 cross between Jime and Cuthbert. It was introduced in 1922. 

Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, very productive, contract mosaic 
 rapidly but are only moderately injured; propagated from suckers; canes numerous, some- 
 what stocky, greenish, heavily glaucous, with very few small glands at the tips; prickles 
 small, slender, weak, very few to none, greenish; leaflets usually 5, rovmdish ovate, dull, 
 dark green, rugose, with dentate margins ; petiole long, glabrous, slightly glaucous. Flowers 
 early; pedicels with few prickles, glandular, slightly pubescent; calyx - prickly. Fruit 
 midseason, midway between June and Cuthbert; autumn-bearing under favorable con- 
 ditions; much Iil<e Cuthbert in size, color, and flavor; large, round-conic, slightly glossy 
 and finely pubescent; torus nearly smooth, blunt, whitish; drupelets of medium size or 
 larger, strongly coherent; cavity-scars white and conspicuous; flesh juicy, firm, tender, 
 aromatic, sprightly becoming sweet, highly flavored; very good in quality.
