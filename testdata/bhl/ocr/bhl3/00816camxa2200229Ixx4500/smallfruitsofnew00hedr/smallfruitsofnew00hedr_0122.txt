Coleman, i. A'. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:681. 1893. 

Received at this Station about 1890 from M. H. Coleman, Geneva, New York. Plants 
 medium in vigor and productiveness; fruit large, moderately firm, juicy, nearly sweet: 
 quality very good.

 i860. 
 Grown from seed of Fastolfif by Dr. W. D. Brinckle of Philadelphia. It first fruited 
 in 1847 and was named by the originator in honor of Col. Marshall P. Wilder. Plants 
 vigorous, strong, productive; prickles whitish; fruit large, roundish, yellowish white or 
 cream color, appearing semi-transparent, soft, juicy, sweet, of fine flavor; very good. 

Colossal. Occidentalis % Strigosus. i. U.S. D. A. Pom. Rpt. 265. 1892. 

A seedling of Shaffer, which it closely resembles. It was first brought to notice when 
 it was sent to the United States Department of Agriculture in 1892 by I. F. Street, West 
 Middleton, Indiana; of better color and more resistant to drouth than Shaffer.

Columbian is the best known and most prized of the hj^brid raspberries. It holds 
 this place by virtue of large size, firm flesh, handsome appearance, and high quality of the 
 fruit ; and the hardiness, healthiness, and phenomenal productiveness of the plants. It is 
 now more largely grown for commercial canning than any other purple raspberry, and when 
 canned is superior to any other in appearance and flavor. Columbian is sometimes con- 
 fused and is often compared with Shaffer, an older hybrid sort. The fruits of Columbian 
 are smaller, firmer, and hang on the plants longer than those of Shaffer; the plants are 
 more vigorous and more productive, and the fruiting season is later. Shaffer excels 
 Columbian only in the greater hardiness of the plant. The leaves are somewhat smaller, 
 with more j-ellow than in those of Shaffer. The fruit is darker in color than that of 
 Shaffer and is sweeter and better flavored. The plants, unfortunately, are a little more 
 subject to winter injury than those of Shaffer. This variety was originated in 1888 by 
 j. T. Thompson, Oneida, New York. It is a seedling of Cuthbert which was probabl}- 
 pollinated, by Gregg, a blackcap growing near by, and was introduced in 1891. The 
 American Pomological Society added Columbian to its list of recommended fruits 
 in 1897. 

Plants very tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy but less so than Shaffer, very 
 productive, contract mosaic slowly, severely injured, susceptible to crown-gall; propagated 
 from tips; canes very stocky, dull, reddish brown, glabrous, thinly glaucous; prickles 
 strong, numerous, light green; leaflets usually 3, large, oval, rugose, glabrous, lighter green 
 than Shaffer, with serrate margins; petiole long, prickly, nearly glabrous. Flowers late, 
 large, in prickly clusters; pedicels slender; caljrs small, pubescent. Fruit late, season 
 begins soon after Shaffer but continues after the season of that variety has closed; large 
 but slightly smaller than Shaffer, broadly round, dull purple, somewhat darker than Shaffer; 
 torus small, rough, blunt, releasing berries easily although the fruit drops but little; 
 drupelets large ; flesh juicy, firmer than Shaffer, sprightly, very aromatic ; quality good.
