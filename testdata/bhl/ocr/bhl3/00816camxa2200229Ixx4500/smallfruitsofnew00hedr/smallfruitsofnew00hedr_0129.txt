THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 99 

soils, and is as hardy to cold and endures heat as well as any other red raspberry. The 
 plants are usually healthy and productive, but are more seriously affected by leaf curl than 
 almost any other sort, and are quite susceptible to the dreaded mosaic. The faults are 
 that the plants are not as productive as those of a good commercial sort ought to be and the 
 crop ripens too late for many northern markets. The berries are of handsome red color, 
 medium firm of flesh, and of very good quality when not overripe. As the berries pass 
 maturity, however, the quality deteriorates and heavy bloom detracts from the attractive- 
 ness of the fruits. Cuthbert was found as a chance seedling by Thomas Cuthbert in his 
 garden at Riverdale, now a part of New York City, about 1865. It was thought the 
 variety might be a seedling of Hudson River Antwerp since it came up near a bed of that 
 sort. The variety was not disseminated until about 1880, but since that time it has been 
 widely grown. The berry was grown in different localities under various names but for 
 the last quarter-century it has been known only as Cuthbert. The American Pomological 
 Society added the variety to its list of recommended fruits in 1881.
