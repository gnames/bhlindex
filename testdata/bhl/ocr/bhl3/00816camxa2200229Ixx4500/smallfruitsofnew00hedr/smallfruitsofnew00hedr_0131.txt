THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK lOI 

free from prickles; fruit large, roundish, red; drupelets medium in size, moderately firm; 
 flavor harsh and acid. 

Eastern King. i. Mich. Sta. Bid. 111:22. 1894. 

Discovered about 1864 by 0. A. Hill, Westbrook, Maine, as a chance seedling on a 
 lot that had formerly been a nursery. Canes stout, half hardy; fruit large, dark red, 
 juicy and very sweet; earlier than Cuthbert.

Although it originated in the Middle West, Eaton is now popular only in New England 
 where the plants seem to be unusually productive an J hardy. The variety is grown rather 
 commonly in some parts of eastern New York, but is not a favorite in other parts of the 
 state. There are several serious faults of fruit and plant: The bemes crumble badly; 
 the drupelets are very large so that the fruits are coarse in appearance; the quality is poor; 
 and the berries do not separate readily from the torus. The faults of the plants are that 
 they droop almost to the ground making them hard to manage ; and there are seldom enough 
 canes to make the variety productive. An unusual characteristic of the canes is that they 
 are nearly thomless. Eaton was found as a chance seedling by Ulysses Eaton, Cambridge 
 City, Indiana, in 1885. Although disseminated locallj-, the variety was never widely intro- 
 duced until Amos Garretson, Pendleton, Indiana, became impressed with its value in 1898 
 and propagated it extensively. At this Station and elsewhere plants received under the 
 names Alton, Idaho, and Iowa have all proved to be Eaton. There is, however, an 
 autumn-bearing berry called Idaho which is quite distinct. 

Plants dwarfish or medium tall, of moderate vigor, drooping, with distinct tendencj^ 
 to branch, ver}' hardy, variable in yield, contract mosaic slowly; propagated by suckers; 
 canes few, slender, greenish tinged with brown, becoming dark red, slightly glaucous, 
 with eglandular tips; prickles very small, slender, weak, verj^ few, with a slight reddish 
 tinge; leaflets 3-5, roundish oval, dark green, dull, rugose, crumpled, with finely serrate 
 margins; petiole medium in length and thickness, nearly glabrous. Flowers early; pedicels 
 glandular, pubescent; calyx prickly. Fruit early midseason, retains its size well, large, 
 round-conical, clear bright, durable red, adheres very tenaciously to the torus which is 
 rough and roundish; drupelets very large, coarse in appearance, broadly grooved, cohere 
 poorly causing the fruit to cnmible; flesh juicy, firm, rather acid, with an agreeable fla\-or; 
 quality good for culinary purposes only, otherwise inferior. 

Elizabeth, i. Card. Mon. 12:279. 1870. 

Originated with D. W. Herstine of Philadelphia from seed of Allen supposed to have 
 been fertilized by Philadelphia which grew near by. Elizabeth was named, together with 
 several other of Mr. Herstine's varieties, by a committee from the Pennsylvania Fruit 
 Growers Society who visited his grounds in 1870. Plants strong, productive; suckers 
 medium in number; prickles numerous, purple; foliage dark green, rugose; fruit very large, 
 round, bright red, firm; drupelets large; flavor delicious; late.
