 but removed it at the following session. Plants vigorous, propagating from tips, hardy, 
 productive; fruit large, roundish oval, regular; drupelets medium firm, juicy, dark red, 
 rich and good; midseason.

 Cyc. Hardy Fr. 276, fig. 1922. 

A few years ago Empire was heralded as a very promising new red raspberry and was 
 largely planted in the eastern part of New York. The assets ascribed to it were hardiness 
 productiveness, vigor, and healthiness of the plants; and large, handsome, firm, well-flavored 
 fruits.- But the variety has been a disappointment to most New York berry growers who 
 plant it. The plants seem to lack that subtle thing called constitution, and after a few 
 years in the plantation go to pieces. In the prime of the plantation the plants are so hardy 
 as to need no winter protection in New York; are equal to any other variety in productive- 
 ness, and are unusually vigorous, reaching a height of sLx or eight feet. The berries, when 
 plantations are at their best, average larger than those of the well-known Cuthbert, are 
 about the same in color, ripen a little earlier, and have a longer picking season. The 
 fruits are mild, rich and sweet, and take rank among the very best red raspberries in quality. 
 The texture is firm and the berries stand shipment well and keep long. Despite this array 
 of good characteristics, which would seem to put Empire among the best commercial red 
 raspberries, it is, as has been said, proving a disappointment in the berry plantations of 
 the state. This variety, a cross between Ruby and Coutant, was originated in 1904 by 
 L. E. Wardell, Marlboro, New York, and introduced by him in 1916. 

Plants tall, vigorous, upright, hardy, very productive, lack constitution, contract 
 mosaic slowly but are severely injured; propagated by suckers; canes medium in number, 
 stocky, green changing to purplish red, becoming yellowish brown at the close of the season.
