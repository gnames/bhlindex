Gladstone. 2. Green Cat. 8. 1890. 3. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:682. 1893. 

Originated as a chance seedhng, probably of Catawissa, with Charles Carpenter, 
 KeUeys Island, Ohio, about 1875, who sent it out in a small way as Carpenter No. 2 and then 
 as the Erie. In 189 1 Green's Nursery Company, Rochester, New York, introduced it imder 
 the name of Gladstone as a hardy, vigorous and productive everbearing variety, a reputation 
 which it failed to maintain. Plants vigorous, moderately productive, fairly hardy; fruit 
 medium in size, round, soft, juicy, purpHsh red, sweet and of good quality; midseason, 
 occasionally autumn-fruiting. 

Erskine Park. i. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 161. 1920. 

Perhaps this sort is now the most popular double-bearing red raspberry. It produces 
 very fair crops in both summer and autumn which can be said of few other of the double- 
 bearing raspberries. The plants seem to be very hardy, fairly healthy and moderately 
 productive in both siunmer and autumn. The original plant was supposed to be a seedling 
 or a sport of Cuthbert, but no trace of the Cuthbert blood can be seen in either plant or 
 fruit. The fruits are not of the highest flavor, are inclined to crumble, and are quite variable 
 in size. Still, they are better than those of Ranere, the only other double-bearing sort 
 which competes with Erskine Park. This double-bearing berry was discovered by E. J.
