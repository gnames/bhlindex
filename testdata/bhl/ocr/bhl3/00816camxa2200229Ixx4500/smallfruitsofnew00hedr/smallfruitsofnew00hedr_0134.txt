THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Norman, near Lee, Alassachusetts, about 1903, and is supposed to be either a seedling or a 
 sport of Cuthbert. Although introduced in 191 1, it was not widely disseminated until 
 within the past six years. 

Plants of medium height, very vigorous, upright, later becoming somewhat spreading, 
 hardy, variable in yield, contract mosaic very slowly and but moderately injured; propa- 
 gated by suckers; canes very numerous, stocky, dull green, glabrous, glaucous; prickles 
 very short, of average thickness and strength, numerous, brownish purple; leaflets 5, large, 
 thick, oval, dark green, rugose, with serrate margins; petiole short, thick, covered with but 
 few. short, weak prickles, pubescent. Flowers very early; pedicels eglandular, pubescent; 
 calyx smooth. Fruit early midseason; autumn-bearing; medium in size although quite 
 variable, round-conic, dull, dark red, with thin bloom, adheres well to the torus which is 
 roughish and pointed; drupelets large, often with poor coherence which causes the berries 
 to crumble; flesh juicy, tender, not very firm, somewhat sprightly but not of highest 
 flavor; quality fair to good. 

Eureka. Occideiitalis x Strigosus. i. Card Bush-Fr. 180. 1898. 

Originated by Luther Burbank. Said to be a third generation seedling from Shaffer. 
 The plants are more compact and productive with larger, brighter red fruits.

 The three references given each describe a different everbearing variety, so it is probable 
 that several sorts went under this name. In the Magazine of Horticulture for 1837 an ever- 
 bearing raspberry is mentioned found near Lake Erie, in New York by the Shakers. It 
 was described as a valuable variety similar to the White Antwerp in size and excellence. 
 It propagated by tipping and was autumn-fruiting. In the Magazine of Horticulture for 
 1843 another everbearing type is described as being very similar to Red Antwerp, beginning 
 to ripen about July isth and bearing until frost. The plants were grooving in the garden 
 of R. Emmet, whose father procured them from Dr. Hosack of Hyde Park. Beyond that 
 its origin could not be traced. In Michigan Station Bulletin iii another berry of the 
 Antwerp type is mentioned as large, soft, like Herstine but not as good. 

Everbearing Feldbrunnen. i. Jour. Roy. Hort. Soc. 37:561. 1911-12. 

On trial on the grounds of the Royal Horticultural Society at Wisley, England, in 191 1. 
 Said to be an excellent variety for autumn-fruiting. Canes strong, purplish green in color; 
 few prickles; fruit borne in large clusters, large, round, rich crimson. 

Excelsior, i. Wis. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 241. 1887. 

Probably a chance seedling from a farm near Cassville, Wisconsin. In 1879 Dr. F. M. 
 Cronin of that town brought plants of an everbearing raspberry to J. H. C. Sneclode, Cass- 
 xille. They produced heavily and plants were sold at $1.00 each. Described as hardy 
 and drouth resistant; fruit large, dark red, delicious; season from June till frost.
