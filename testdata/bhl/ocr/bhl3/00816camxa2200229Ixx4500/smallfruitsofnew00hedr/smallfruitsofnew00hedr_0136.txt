Framboise Americaine. i. Knoop /^rwctoZogze 2:179. 1771. 

Under this name Knoop describes four sorts, the first being later and darker red than 
 the others and grows in moimtainous localities in Germany, France, Belgium, and England. 
 The second is similar to the first except that the fruit is yellowish white and sweeter than 
 the first. It is less esteemed than the first because of its color. The third resembles the 
 preceding but is without thorns, the fruit is larger and the flavor more acid. It grows princi- 
 pally in the mountains. The fourth resembles the preceding sorts, but the leaves are not 
 divided, the flowers are larger, reddish and very fragrant; the fruits ripen rarely (Holland). 
 This sort was brought from Canada. 

Franconia. i. Mag. Hort. 6:310. 1840. 

This variety was introduced into America some years previous to 1845 by S. G. Perkins 
 of Boston who imported it from Vilmorin of Paris. Downing described it as the hardiest 
 large raspberry, very productive and very excellent. For a number of years it sustained 
 this reputation and was considered one of the best market varieties. The American Pomo- 
 logical Society placed Franconia in its fruit list in 1852 where it still remained in the last 
 list in 1909. Plants vigorous, spreading, moderately hardy, productive; prickles few. 
 stout, purplish; fruit large, blunt-conic, dark purplish red, firm, rich and sprightly; good;
