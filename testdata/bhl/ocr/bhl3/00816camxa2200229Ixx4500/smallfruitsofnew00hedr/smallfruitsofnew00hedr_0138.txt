poorly; fruit large, elongated-conic, golden yellow, tender, juicy, mild, aromatic, pleasant; 
 midseason, ripening period long 

Golden Drop. i. Bunyard Ca/. 50. 1915-16. 

Offered by Bunyard, Maidstone, England, as a Continental variety which he named 
 provisionally, the original name ha^'ing been lost. Canes strong; fruit round, deep golden, 
 pleasantly flavored. 

Golden Queen, i. Rural N. Y. 44:529. 1885. 2. Ibid. 45:573, fig. 344- 1886. 

Golden Queen is the only yellow raspberry worth planting by those who want raspberries 
 of this color. It is supposed to be a sport of Cuthbert from which it differs only in the 
 berries, which instead of being the Cuthbert red are light yellow, sometimes tinged with 
 pink and are larger, more delicately flavored and softer in te.xture than those of the sup- 
 posed parent. The canes are a little paler in color. The opening leaves of the young shoots 
 lack the reddish tinge always noticeable in normal red raspberries, and the gland-like tips 
 of both the younger and older leaves are greenish yellow; both of these characteristics 
 are probably correlations with the yellow fruit. The remnants of the styles on the fruits 
 are very distinct and contrast strongly against the orange-yellow surface because of their 
 dark color. The foliage of Golden Queen seems to be especially tender and is easily injured 
 by high winds, and as the leaves come to full size they are very rugose or much crumpled. 
 Unfortunately the plants are very susceptible to the mosaic disease and rapidly succumb to 
 it. The variety is of small use for conunercial plantations, but because of the distinctive 
 color and the high quaHty of the fruits should be in every private collection of berries. 
 This variety originated in a plantation of Cuthberts on the grounds of Ezra Stokes, Berlin, 
 Camden County, New Jersey, in 1882. The American Pomological Society added Golden 
 Queen to its list of recommended fruits in 1887. 

Goliath. I. Fest. Pom. Inst. Reui. 129. 1910. 2. Jour. Pom. & Hort. Set. 3:25. 1922. 
 A European sort. Highly recommended for general culture in Germany, but said to 
 be of Httle value in England because of unproductiveness and small fruit. Plants vigorous 
 and productive; fruit large, bright red, firm, aromatic; early. 

Goodwin. 

An unintroduced seedling found growing in a strawberry bed about 19 18 by F. C. 
 Goodwin, Clark Mills, New York. It has all the characteristics of a red raspberry- but 
 propagates from the tips and does not sucker. Plants tall, very vigorous, upright-spread- 
 ing, healthy; canes very stocky, reddish brown, glabrous, without bloom or glandular 
 tips; prickles small, strong, nvimerous, purplish red; fruit large, roundish; drupelets large, 
 of medium coherence, attractive medium red, glossy, juicy; flavor and aroma of the red 
 raspberry', sprightly; good; a few days later than Coltmibian. 

Gordon. 

Received at this Station in 1913 from Sylvanus Gordon, Sergeantsville, New Jersey, 
 who thought it a seedling of Shaffer. It produces suckers and can be grown by tipping. 
 Plants medium in height, vigorous, upright, productive; suckers few; fruit variable in size, 
 large to small, roundish, dark red, firm, crumbly, tart; poor.
