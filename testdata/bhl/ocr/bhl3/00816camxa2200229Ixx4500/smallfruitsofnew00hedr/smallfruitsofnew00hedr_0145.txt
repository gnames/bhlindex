THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK HI 

rounder, but not quite so firm. This lack of firmness is the chief if not the only defect of 
 the fruit. The berries, however, carry to nearby markets with ordinary care. In most 
 seasons and on good raspberry' soils the berries are remarkable for holding their size from 
 the earliest to the latest picking. The plants are somewhat susceptible to spur-blight 
 and to leaf-spot. Herbert is a chance seedling foimd in the garden of R. B. Whyte, Ottawa, 
 Canada, in 1887. The variety may be a seedling of Clarke since Mr. Whyte raised many 
 seedlings of this variety. 

Plants tall, very vigorous, upright-spreading, very hardy, very productive, contracting 
 mosaic very slowly, but then severely injured, and very susceptible to leaf -spot; prop- 
 agated from suckers; canes numerous although somewhat variable, very stocky, green 
 becoming brownish red, glabrous, glaucous, with eglandular tips; prickles small, short, 
 strong, numerous, purplish red; leaflets 3-5, large, thick, attractive dark green, rugose, 
 with serrate margins; petiole of medium length, thick, prickly, glabrous, slightly glaucous. 
 Flowers early; pedicels prickly, glandular, pubescent; cal^'x prickly. Fruit midseason, 
 continuing slightly beyond that of Cuthbert, holds size well throughout the entire season; 
 large to very large, broadly ovate, broader and rotmder than Cuthbert, dark but bright 
 red, with thin bloom, adheres fairly well to the torus which is roughish and sharply pointed ; 
 drupelets medium to large, larger than those of Cuthbert, coherent; flesh juicy, rather 
 soft under unfavorable conditions, pleasantly flavored, somewhat more sprightly than 
 Cuthbert, aromatic; good in quality. 

Herstine. Occidentalis x Strigosus. i, Card Mom. 12:278, PI. 289. 1870. 

Originated with D. W. Herstine, Branchton, Pennsylvania. It was grown from seed 
 of Allen supposed to have been pollinated by Philadelphia growing nearby. In 1870 
 a committee from the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society inspected numerous seedlings 
 growing on the grounds of Mr. Herstine and named four of them, including the Herstine. 
 It attracted considerable attention and for a time was considered a promising variety. 
 The plant lacked hardiness, and was slightly deficient in pollen, causing imperfect berries. 
 The fruits are too soft for shipping though of fine flavor and appearance. The American 
 Poraological Society placed Herstine in its list of recommended varieties in 1873 and 
 removed it in 1899. Plants vigorous, productive, not hardy; prickles medium in number, 
 greenish; fruit large, blunt-conic, bright red; drupelets small, rather soft, juicy, sweet, rich. 

Highland Hardy, i. Cult. & Count. Gent. 40:2 jS. 1875. 

Originated as a chance seedling about 1870 on the farm of Nathaniel Palmatier, 
 Highland, New York. For several years prior to 1880 it was grown considerably as an 
 early sort for the New York market but was soon displaced by better varieties. South of 
 New York its foliage was injured by the sun. Highland Hardy was placed in the fruit 
 catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1883 and removed in 1895. Plants 
 moderately vigorous, upright, productive; prickles few; fruit of mediimi size, roundish, 
 light red, soft, sweet; good.
