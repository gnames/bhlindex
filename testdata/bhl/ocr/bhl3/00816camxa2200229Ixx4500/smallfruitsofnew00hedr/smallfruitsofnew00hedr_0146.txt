 This variety originated with M. Souchet in Bagnolet, near Paris, France, previous to 
 1858. It was introduced into this country- about 1858 by Aubry & Souchet, French nur- 
 serymen, Carpenters Landing, New Jersey. For a time it was a favorite sort, but it was 
 soon displaced by better varieties. The variety was placed in the list of promising new 
 varieties of the American Pomological Society in i860, upon the society's catalog in 1869, 
 from which it was remo\ed in 1899. Plants vigorous, upright, productive; prickles few, 
 short, purplish; fruit-stems very long; fruit very large, conical, dark red; drupelets compact, 
 variable in size, moderately firm, juicy, subacid; good; season medium long.

As grown in England the stock of this variety is said to be badly mixed with types 
 mostly inferior to it. These rogues are attributed either to the growth of seedlings or to 
 bud sporting from the roots. Plants vigorous, ver>' productive; canes very numerous, 
 moderately stout, nearly erect, moderately glaucous, glabrous; prickles few, small, soft; 
 fruit small, round or slightly short-conic; drupelets large, sweet.

This variety is supposed to have been brought to America about 181 7 by a Mr. Briggs, 
 Poughkeepsie, New York, who obtained it from the garden of the Duke of Bedford in 
 England. Its culture spread through the sections of the Hudson Valley where it thrived, 
 and for twenty-five years it was the leading market variety in the Valley, being most 
 extensively planted along the west shore from Cornwall to Kingston. In 1878 it was esti- 
 mated that 14,700 bushels were shipped from Marlboro. Its fruits began ripening early 
 and continued over a long season; they shipped well, and the plants were very productive. 
 The variety went out of cultivation because of tenderness to cold, inability to thrive in 
 other localities, and the ravages of a disease called " Curl leaf.'' The plants were tall.
