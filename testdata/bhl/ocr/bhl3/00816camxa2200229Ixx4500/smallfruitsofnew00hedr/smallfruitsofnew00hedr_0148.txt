June has become a general favorite among growers of raspberries because of several 
 remarkable assets. The plants are hardy, very vigorous, and the yield is not only heavy 
 but is well distributed over a long season. The characteristic which forms the chief merit, 
 however, is that it is about the earliest of all red raspberries, ripening its fruits at this Sta- 
 tion in Jime, as does no other variety. The plants produce comparatively few suckers 
 and these are widely separated so that the crop matures well. June is a cross between 
 Loudon and Marlboro both of which it surpasses in most characters. The fruits resemble 
 those of Loudon in color, but are a brighter, handsomer red ; they are larger, and usually more 
 spherical. The product ships well throughout the season and is good in quality although 
 not of the best. The variety seems to do rather better on heavy soils than on light 
 soils. June originated on the grounds of the New York Agricultural Experiment Station 
 in 1897. 

Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, very productive, contract mosaic 
 slowly and but moderately injured, attacked by cane-blight in but few localities, propagated
