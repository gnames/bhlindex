THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 1 I5 

by suckers; canes rather few, making the increase of stock slow, stocky, greenish changing 
 to reddish brown, heavily glaucous, with eglandular tips; prickles practically none or only 
 toward the base of the suckers; leaflets usually 5, roundish ovate, the lobes often broadly 
 and shallowly cut, dark green, rugose, with faintly dentate margins; petiole of medium 
 length, thick, glabrous, glaucous. Flowers early; pedicels eglandular, glabrous; calyx 
 smooth. Fruit very early, season long, ships well; large to very large, holds size unusually 
 well until the close of the season, roundish to ovate-round, bright, handsome, medium to 
 dark red, adheres well to the torus which is rough and whitish; drupelets large, coherent; 
 cavity-scars inconspicuous; flesh juicy, firm but tender, mildly subacid; quality fair to 
 good although not of the highest. 

Kathrine. i. Townsend Cat. 34. 1925. 

A seedling of Ranere originated by E. W. Townsend in 1922 and introduced by his 
 company, Salisbury, Maryland, in 1925. Described as very similar to Ranere but more 
 productive. 

Keighley Queen. 1. Jour. Hort. 25:1:^5. 1892. 

A sample of this variety was sent to the editor of the Journal of Horticulture in August, 
 1892, for his opinion as to its value. It was reported as "very good." 

Kenyon. Strigosus .x Occidentalis. i. Mich. Sta. Bui. 111:36. 1894. 2. A'. Y. Sta. 
 Bui. 278:117. 1906. 
 Kenyon was introduced by T. A. Kenyon, McGregor, Iowa, who found it growing in 
 a row of black raspberries in 1885. It is supposed to be a seedling of Shaffer, but it does 
 not propagate from the tips. Kenyon is considered of value in Iowa because of hardiness 
 and productivity, but is inferior to other sorts as grown here. Plants vigorous, hardy, 
 productive; fruit above medium in size, dark red, moderately firm, crumbly, separating 

from the torus with difficulty; fair in flavor and quality.

Kevitt Hybrid, i. Am. Pom. Sac. Rpt. 285. 192 1. 

Introduced by William H. Himt Company of New York City in 1921. Said to be a 
 very strong grower, hardy and nearly free from seeds. 

Keystone, i. Rural N. Y. 15:335. 1864. 

A seedling of Hornet (I) raised by A. L. Felton of Philadelphia, about 1864. Plants 
 not hardy; fruit large, bright red; flesh tender, highly flavored. 

King. I. U. S. D. A. Pom. Rpt. 265. 1892. 2. Hedrick Cyc. Hardy Fr. 278. 1922. 

Thompson King. 3. Mich. Sta. Bui. 111:314. 1894. 

Early King. 4. Ohio Sta. Bid. 63:109. 1895. 

This midsummer sort, although hardy, is not as satisfactory in New York and the 
 North as several other standard sorts, but in West Virginia and westward through the 
 Central West it is cotmted as one of the best early red raspberries. In Minnesota it is 
 especially valued. Wherever grown, it thrives best on clay soils. In New York the fruits 
 are coarser and more crumbly than other standard sorts. It is fairly free from mosaic, 
 but is by no means immune. King was grown from seed, possibly of Thompson, by T. 
 Thomspon, Richmond, Virginia. The variety was introduced by the Cleveland Nursery
