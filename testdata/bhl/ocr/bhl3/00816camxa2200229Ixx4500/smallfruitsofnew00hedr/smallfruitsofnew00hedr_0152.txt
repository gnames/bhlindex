King of the Market, i. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 285. 1921. 

Originated by George W. Elliott, Makanda, Illinois, and introduced by Bradley 
 Brothers of Makanda in 1915. Plants upright, stalky, productive; fruit attractive light 
 crimson, firm, rich, delicious; doufcle-cropper. 

Kirriemuir Fillbasket. i. Jour. Pom. & Hart. Sci. 3:27. 1922. 

Received at the East Mailing Research Station in England with the report that it 
 degenerates rapidl}' to a form of much less value. The degenerate form is known as Com- 
 mon Fillbasket; the fruit is smaller and the plants less productive. The true type is said 
 to be the largest fruited and heaviest yielder of all varieties known in Perthshire. Canes 
 dull reddish purple, heavily glaucous, glabrous; prickles few or almost absent, short, stout; 
 fruit large, round, bright red. 

Kirtiand. i. Mag. Hon. 26:223. i860. 2. U. S. D. A. Rpt. 136, PI. 12. 1866. . 
 Cincinnati Red. 3. Horticulturist 2^'. ^\$. 1869. 
 Discovered previous to 1858 by Dr. J. A. Warder growing in the garden of Dr. J. P. 
 Kirtiand, Cleveland, Ohio. Dr. Kirtiand believed he had obtained the plants elsewhere, 
 but it was not recognized as any known variety. It was named and introduced by H. F. 
 Lum, Sandusky, Ohio. From the variation in the different descriptions it is probable that 
 more than one sort passed under this name. The variety is hardy but is injured by the 
 sun in the South. Plants ^^igorous, upright, with few branches, hardy, productive; 
 prickles few, weak, whitish; fruit medium to large, roundish, bright red; drupelets large, 
 firm, not juicy, nor of high quality. 

Knevett Giant, i. Downing Fr. Trees Am. 51S. 1845. 2. Horticulturist 4:79, fig. 71. 
 1849-50. 
 Imported from England about 1843 by Marshall P. Wildei of Boston, who received 
 the plants as a present from Messrs. Chandler & Company, VaiLxhall, England, who knew 
 nothing of the origin of the variety. It was considered an excellent sort, similar to Red 
 Antwerp but more hardy. Plants upright, vigorous, hardy, productive; prickles few, 
 short, purplish; fruit large, roundish conic, dark red, firm; good.
