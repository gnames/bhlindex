Koch. I. .V. Y. Sta. Bid. 278:117. 1906. 

An unnamed seedling grown by C. H. Kocli, Middlehope, Xew York, which was 
 received for trial at this Station in 1896. Inferior to other varieties. Plants of moderate 
 \-igor and tender to cold; fruit medium in size, firm, crumbh'; good. 

Kreigh. i. Gard. Moii. 22:276. 18S0. 

A sample of this varietj-, a new seedling, was sent to the editor of Gardener's Monthly 
 in 1880. Plants described as hardy, productive; fruit of fair size, fin-n and of excellent 
 quality. 

La France. 1. Armstrong Cat. 22, fig. 1922. 2. Lovett Cat. 8, fig. 1923. 

On the grounds of this Station, La France is so similar in plant and fruit to Erskinu 
 Park that a separate description is not necessary. The plants grown here were secured 
 from the introducer, as they have been from several other sources, and have been observed 
 in several different localities, so that without question it can be said that in no essential 
 characters does the La France differ from Erskine Park. There is hesitancy, however, in 
 saying that the variety is Erskine Park renamed when there is a definite statement of another 
 origin. La France is said to have originated as a seedling of a French beny. It was 
 discovered by A. Alius, Stamford, Connecticut, about 1912. The variety was introduced 
 in 1920 by John Scheepers, New York City.

 It was brought to this country a few years later but never became of any importance. 
 Plants moderately vigorous, upright, not hardy, fairly productive; suckers profusely; 
 fruit large, roundish conic, red, soft, sweet; excellent; autumn-fruiting.

Grosse Blanche. 2. Bunyard-Thomas Fr. Gard. 165. 1904.

 continuing a long time in bearing. The fruit is amber colored. 

Latham, i. Am. Pcnn. Soc. Rpt. 161. 1920.

Redpath. 3. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 285. 1921. 

Latham is among the most notable red raspberries recently introduced. The plants 
 are conspicuous for their hardiness and healthiness, although they contract the dreaded 
 mosaic disease rather rapidly, and are often much injured by powdery mildew. Because 
 of the great vigor of the plant, however, the injury from mosaic is rather less than with the 
 average red raspberry. The berries are ver\' large, bright red, glossy, and hold up in size 
 well. Unfortunately, they are rather inferior in flavor, crumble a little more than one 
 likes, and there are often a considerable number of double berries. The large size, however.
