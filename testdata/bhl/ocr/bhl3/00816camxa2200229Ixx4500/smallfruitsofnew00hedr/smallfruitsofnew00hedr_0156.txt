jl8 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

and their attractive appearance more than make up for the faults. Latham is rapidly 
 taking a high place among red raspberries because of its hardy and productive plants and 
 its attractive fruits. This berry was originated at the Minnesota State Fruit Breeding 
 Farm as a cross between King and Loudon and was introduced in 1 9 1 2 as Minnesota Number 
 4. It was named Latham in honor of A. W. Latham, long Secretary of the Minnesota 
 State Horticultural Society. Redpath, which was introduced by J. V. Bailey, St. Paul, 
 Minnesota, in 192 1, is identical with Latham. 

Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, very hardy, very productive, contract mosaic 
 rapidly, moderately injured; severely injured by powdery mildew; propagated by suckers; 
 canes numerous, very stocky, green changing to reddish brown, very glaucous, with 
 eglandular tips; prickles small, slender, weak, few or none, brownish; leaflets 3-5, large, 
 oval, dark green, dull, thick, rugose, with serrate margins; petiole medium in length and 
 thickness, slightly prickly, glabrous, glaucous. Flowers late; pedicels prickly, glandular, 
 pubescent; calyx prickly. Fruit late, withstands drouth well; large to very large, hemis- 
 pherical, in some seasons inclined to grow double, light red, glossy, adheres to the torus 
 which is rough and pointed; drupelets mediiim to large, somewhat coarse in appearance, 
 with weak coherence making the berries crumble imder unfavorable conditions; flesh juicy, 
 firm, mildly subacid, variable in flavor; good in quality, sometimes below. 

Leyerle. i. Childs Cat. 32. 1920. 

Originated with Jake Leyerle, Jackson County, Illinois. It was introduced as an 
 everbearing red raspberry in 1920 by John Lewis Childs, Floral Park, New York. As 
 grown at this Station it is not an everbearer and is far inferior to other varieties of its season. 
 Plants tall, vigorous, upright, medium in productivity; suckers numerous; canes glaucous, 
 with glandular tips; prickles numerous, very small; fruit of medium size, irregular, short, 
 roimdish; drupelets mediimi in size, coherence medium; dull unattractive red, medium 
 juicy, soft, mild; fair; early midseason. 

Lindley. i. Am. Hort. Ann. 103. 1867. 

Raised by Joseph B. Lindley, Newark, New Jersey, previous to 1867. Said to be a 
 hybrid between Fastolff and a native variety. Plants strong, tall, upright, much branched, 
 tender to cold; suckers too freely; prickles numerous, stout, greenish; fruit medium to 
 large, shghtly blunt-conic, red; drupelets medium to large, compact, soft, juicy, sweet; 
 good. 

Little Prolific. 1. Rural N. Y. 42:6^8. 1883. 

A chance seedling sent out in 1883 by Joseph Little, Granton, Ontario. It was never 
 widely disseminated and soon went out of cultivation. Plants slender, branching, without 
 prickles, hardy, very productive; fruit of medium size, shghtly roundish conic, light pur- 
 plish red, moderately firm, juicy, with acid flavor; eariy. 
 Lloyd George, i. Bunyard Cat. S7- 1921- 2. Jour. Pom. & Hort. Sci. 3:28. 1922. 

Lloyd George is a chance seedling found growing in a wood in Dorsetshire, England. 
 a few years ago. It was introduced by J. J. Kettle, Corfe Castle, Dorset, England, and is 
 considered one of the most promising of recent introductions. It was introduced as an 
 autumn-fruiting sort but is unreliable in that respect. The plants are vigorous, stout.
