THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK IIC) 

upright; prickles \-ery numerous, small, stout and very dark colored; leaves very flat; fruil 
 very large and verj- long, oblong-conic, rounded at the end, sweet; good. 

Longworth. i. Horticulturist S:i8j. 1853. 

A seedling of Col. Wilder raised by Dr. W. D. Brinckle of Philadelphia about 1847. 
 Fniit large, round, deep crimson. 

Lord Beaconsfield. i. Flor. & Pont. 140. 1883. 

A chance seedling found in the garden of A. Faulkner, Inkpen, near Hungerford, 
 England, in 1873. It was e.xhibited before the Royal Horticultural Society in August, 
 1883, and received a first class certificate from that organization. Plant described as tall, 
 stout, very productive; fruit large, slightly roundish conic, dark red; of fine quality; season 
 long. 

Lome. I. Can. Exp. Farm Bui. 56:47. 1907. 

Originated by Dr. William Saunders, Ottawa, Canada. It is not especially promising. 
 A strong grower, moderately productive; fruit above medium in size, conic, dark red, 
 firm, juicy, subacid, pleasing; good; midseason. 

Lost Rubies, i. Cult. & Count. Gent. 46:742. 1881. 2. A'. 1'. Sta. Bui. 63:683. 1893. 
 Found growing in a bed of Naomi by A. M. Purdy, Palmyra, New York; introduced 
 by Charles A. Green, Rochester, New York, about 1881. Some have thought it to be 
 identical with Naomi, but most reports indicate that it is different. The blossoms are 
 deficient in pollen and require the presence of another variety to set good crops. As 
 grown here the variety is neither hardy nor productive. The fruits are small, soft, and 
 crumble badly; eariier than Cuthbert. 

Louboro. I. A'. Y . Sta. Bui. 2g&:^6. 1908. 

A seedhng of Loudon x Marlboro raised at this Station from a cross made in 1897. 
 The first fruit was borne in 1900, and the first plants were sent out in 1908. It has not 
 proved of much value, owing to the light color and softness of the fruit and the dwarfish 
 character of the plants. Plants medium to dwarfish in height, of medium vigor, upright, 
 hardy, productive; suckers medium in number; canes glabrous; tips eglandular; prickles 
 very few; fruit of medium size, broad, roundish; drupelets large, of medium coherence, 
 light red, rather soft, sweet; good; midseason. 

Loudon. I. Rriral N. Y. 52:618. 1893. 2. Mich. Sta. Bui. 111:288. 1894. 3. N. Y. 
 Sta. Bui. 278:117. 1906. 
 Long a standard sort, Loudon seems now to be declining in favor with commercial 
 berry growers. It is difficult to see why it is losing in popularity, but probably because 
 the plants are not very productive and are subject to crown-gall or " knotty roots." The 
 quality, also, is not quite up to the mark and the berries very often run small or below size. 
 The plants are very hardy, very vigorous, and for these reasons the variety is still largely 
 grown toward the northern limits for this fruit. The product is liked by canners because 
 the berries hold their color well. Loudon was originated by Frank W. Loudon about 1884, 
 as a cross between Turner and Cuthbert. In 1897 the variety was added to the recom- 
 mended fruit list of the American Pomological Society. Loudon was introduced by 
 Charles A. Green, Rochester, New York.
