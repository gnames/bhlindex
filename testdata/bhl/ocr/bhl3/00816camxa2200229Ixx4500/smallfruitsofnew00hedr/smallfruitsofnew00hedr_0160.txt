I20 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Plants medium in height and vigor, upright, very hardy, variable in productiveness 
 and health, contract mosaic slowly; propagated by suckers; canes niunerous, stocky, 
 greenish changing to rather bright red but brown towards the base, with eglandular tips; 
 prickles medium in number, short, rather stout, reddish; leaflets 3-5, oval, dark green, 
 thick, rugose, with dentate margins; petiole long, thick, prickly. Fruit midseason, harvest 
 period long, holds up in size very well; medium to large, conic, bright red, cHngs well to 
 the torus which releases the berries readily; drupelets large with a well-marked suture, 
 cohering so that the berries do not crumble; flesh juicy, firm, tender, moderately sweet,

Imported from France by W. W. Dunlop of Montreal, in 1892. The foliage is of the 
 blackberry type. The fruit is of no value as many of the drupelets fail to develop. 

Magnum Bonum. i. Mag. //ort. 22:27. 1856. 

Mentioned in the Magazine of Horticulture for 1856 as a new variety recently received 
 from England. Plants of meditun vigor, tender to cold; suckers profusely; fruit medium 
 in size, roundish or slightly conic, deep yellow, soft, juicy, briskly subacid, pleasing; 
 good; midseason. 

Manitou. i. ///. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 213, 224. 1906. 

E. A. Riehl, Godfrey, Illinois, procured this berr>' of A. B. Sibert, Rochester, Indiana, 
 in 1905. On trial in IlHnois in 1906, it was said to be very promising on clay soils. A 
 free plant maker and very productive; fruit large, bright red, firm, well flavored. 

Marlative. i. AT. V. Sta. 5m/. 298:57. 1907. 

A seedling of Marlboro x Superlative grown at this Station from a cross made in 1897. 
 Plants were first sent out in 1908. It was introduced because of the unusual attractiveness 
 in size and color of fruit, but lack of hardiness has caused its propagation to be discon- 
 tinued. Plants stocky, semi-dwarf, upright-spreading, half-hardy, very productive; 
 suckers numerous; canes glaucous; prickles few, small; fruit large, roundish ovate, dark 
 red; drupelets large, coarse, crumbly, melting, sweet, pleasing; good; midseason.

Perfection. 3. Bunyard Cat. 50. 1915-16. 

This old sort, formerly grown in all the raspberry regions of North America, is now 
 losing popularity. It still is, however, a standard early red raspberry in a few localities 
 in New York and the East, along the shores of Lake Erie, and in Colorado. The variety 
 is prized, where it succeeds, for hardiness and productiveness of plant; for its very large 
 handsome fruits; and because the crop hangs on the bushes three or four days after maturity 
 and is still marketable, in which respect the variety is unique. The defects which have 
 caused its wane in popularity are that the plants are capricious as to soils, lack in vigor, 
 and suffer much from even a sHght drouth. A. J. Caywood, Mariboro, New York, 
 originated this berry neariy fifty years ago. It is supposed to be a cross between one of 
 Caywood's seedlings and Highland Hardy, and was introduced in 1884. In 1885 the 
 American Pomological Society added Marlboro to its list of recommended fruits.
