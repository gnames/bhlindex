Muriel, i. Mich. Sta. Bui 111:43. 1894. 2. Can. Exp. Farm Bill. 56:47. 190;. 

A seedling of Biggar originated by Dr. William Saunders, Ottawa, Canada, previous 

to 1894. Described as vigorous and productive; fruit medium to above in size, roundish 

to slightly conic, bright red, moderately firm, juicy, subacid; quality above medium; early. 

Muskberry. 1. Childs Cat. 135. 1897. 2. Mich. Sia. Bui. 206:59. 1903- 

Introduced by J. L. Childs in 1897 as belonging to the raspberry family. Plant 
 described in 1903 in Michigan Station Bulletin 206 as a rank grower, reaching a height of 
 eight to ten feet, and spreading so rapidly from the roots as to become a nuisance in the 
 garden; fruit of good size and attractive red in appearance, but the flavor is insipid and 
 disagreeable. The bushes have a musky odor. 

Muskingum. Occidentalis x Strigosus. i. Ann. Hort. 104. 1889. 2. jV. Y Sta. Bui. 
 63:678. 1893. 

Originated about 1880 in the orchard of Airs. Simeon Ellis, Coshocton County, near 
 the Muskingum River in Ohio. Named and introduced by James Madison, Chili, Ohio. 
 It was similar to Shaffer, the plants being smaller and more compact, and the fruit smaller 
 and firmer. Plants vigorous and fairly hardy; fruit medium to large, soft, moderately 
 juicy, acid flavor; good. 
 Naomi. 1. Horticulturist 2o:t,22, fig. 1865. 2. AT. 7. Sta. 5!(/. 63:683. 1893. 

Grown from seed about 1850 by Mrs. Reuben Wood, Rockport, Ohio. It was intro- 
 duced about 1866 by Charles Carpenter, Kelleys Island, Ohio. Much confusion exists 
 regarding this variety and many pomologists have insisted that Naomi was identical with 
 Franconia, while Lost Rubies, Cuthbert, and Fastolff have also been given as synonyms. 
 From various reports it is evident that the stock of Naomi was badly mixed when introduced 
 or soon after. It is probable, too, that Naomi and Franconia are very similar. The descrip- 
 tions of both varieties as grown here agree rather closely. Naomi is said to be hardier and 
 the drupelets smaller than with Franconia. Plants vigorous, only moderately hardy, of 
 medium productivity; suckers few; canes slender, with few laterals, reddish brown; prickles 
 numerous, small; fruit large, roundish, slightly conical, bright attractive red; drupelets 
 large, rather soft, mildly subacid, pleasant in flavor; good; late midseason. 

Narragansett. i. Card. Mon. 14:28. 1872. 

A seedling of Orange, which originated in the garden of John F. Jolls, Providence. 
 Rhode Island, first fruiting in 1868. Described as a large, vigorous, hardy plant, with 
 large, conic, bright red, firm, well flavored berries; autumn-fruiting. 

Nature, i. N. Y. State Fr. Gr. Assoc. Rpi. lyg. 1910. 

Mentioned in a discussion at a meeting of the New York State Fruit Growers' Associa- 
 tion as an old-fashioned variety. Considered a firm and very good shipping berrj'. 

Nelson, i. Can. Exp. Farm Bui. 56:48. 1907. 

Originated by Dr. William Saimders, Ottawa, Canada. Plant described as vigorous, 
 moderately productive and not hardy enough at Ottawa. Fruit above medium in size.
