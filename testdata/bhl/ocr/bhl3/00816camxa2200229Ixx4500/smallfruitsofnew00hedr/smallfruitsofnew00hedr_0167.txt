In a collection of about one hundred varieties of red raspberries on the grounds of 
 this Station Newman has been for several years one of the best if not the best. The variety 
 is remarkable for its large, handsome fruits which are borne in great profusion. It is one 
 of the most productive red raspberries of any kind ever grown on the grounds of this Station. 
 The quality of the product is not high, but it is good, and few would notice that it is not up 
 to the best. The berries are firm and ship well. The plants are vigorous, ver>- hardy, 
 healthy, and, as has been said, exceedingly productive. The characteristic that commends 
 Newman most highly, however, is that the plants are almost free from the mosaic disease 
 that is ever>^vhere destroying red raspberries in this State. The originator, C. P. Newman, 
 Ville Lasalle, Quebec, planted in 1909 a mixture of seed of Herbert, King, Loudon, Cuthbert, 
 and Eaton, all open to cross pollination, and from a large number of seedlings this variety 
 was selected as the best. Mr. Newman gave the New York State Fruit Testing 
 Association, Geneva, New York, permission to distribute his new berrj'. 

Plants above medium in height, vigorous, upright-spreading, ver\- hardy, ver>' pro- 
 ductive, contract mosaic very slowly, moderately injured; propagated b\' suckers; canes 
 numerous, medium to stocky, green changing to reddish brown, thinly glaucous, with 
 eglandular tips; prickles small, slender, weak, very few or none, reddish; leaflets usually 5, 
 roundish obovate, dull, rugose, with serrate margins; petiole medium in length and thick- 
 ness, slightly prickly, glabrous. Flowers early; pedicels very prickly, glandular, pubescent. 
 Fruit midseason, ships well ; large to very large, uniform, round-conic, glossy red, with heavy 
 bloom, picks easily but adheres well to the torus which is roughish and creamy white; 
 drupelets of meditmi size, with strong coherence; flesh moderately juicy or somewhat scant, 
 very firm but tender, mildly subacid, not highly flavored; quality fair to good. 

Newman No. 20. 

Raised from open-pollinated seed of Eaton sown in the fall of 1907 by C. P. Newman, 
 Ville Lasalle, Quebec. It was sent out for trial in 1915. As grown at this Station it is 
 a very promising late variety, the fruit being of large size, firm and of fairly good quality. 
 The color is rather light for a market berrj-. The plants are healthy, hardy, and produc- 
 tive on the Station grounds, but Mr. Newman reports that a considerable part of the crop 
 sometimes dries up, thereby reducing production. Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, 
 productive; canes stocky, green tinged reddish brown, thinly glaucous; tips eglandular; 
 prickles slender, numerous, dark purple; foliage dull medium green, roughened; flowers 
 late; fruit uniformly large, regular, roundish conic; drupelets medium in number, large.
