Flaming Giant. 3. Stark Bros. Cat. 64. 192 1. 

A cross of a wild red raspberry from Cavalier County, North Dakota, and Minne- 
 tonka, which was originated by Prof. N. E. Hansen, of South Dakota Experiment Station 
 in 1906. It was named Ohta, the Sioux Indian word for " much " or " many," and intro- 
 duced by the Station in 191 2. Where hardiness is essential, Ohta is a promising variety. 
 The crops are fairly heavy. It is inferior to standard varieties at this Station in size and 
 flavor, the latter being too tart for a table berry. Plants tall, vigorous, upright, hardy and 
 productive; suckers very numerous; canes slender, green tinged reddish brown, heavily 
 glaucous, with glandular tips; prickles small, slender, very numerous; leaflets medium in 
 size, oval, dark green, roughened; petiole long, slender, prickly, 'pubescent, glabrous, 
 glandular, slightly glaucous; flowers early, white; fruit variable in size, medixim to above, 
 roundish; drupelets medium in nvimber and coherence, light red, vary from soft to firm, 
 tart; poor; early. 

Olathe. I. A^. Y. Sta. Bid. 63:684. 1893. 

Stayman No. 5. 2. Mass. Sta. Bui. 10:11. 1890. 

A seedling of Reliance originated by J. Stayman, Leavenworth, Kansas, from seed 
 planted by him in 1884. It was sent to experiment stations for trial about 1890 and in 
 1 894 was named Olathe by the originator. As grown here the fruit is inclined to crumble. 
 Plants upright, vigorous, hardy and very productive; canes slender, tinged with red; 
 fruit large, attractive dark red, firm; drupelets medium in size, inclined to crumble, firm, 
 juicy; good; late. 

Ontario, i. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 161. 1920. 2. Hedrick Oc Hardy Fr. 279. 1922. 

Ontario has the record of having surpassed every other variety ever grown on the 
 Station grounds in quantity of fruit. It seems to make a place for itself in commercial 
 plantations to precede Cuthbert and to follow Marlboro, Perfection, and June. The berries 
 are large, handsome, well flavored, keep and ship well. The fruit is too dark when fully 
 ripe, but remains firm. Perhaps it is not too much to say that it is one of the very best 
 shippers, and, because of the firmness, it makes a good sort for commercial canning. 
 Ontario was originated as a second generation seedling of Superlative and Loudon in 1909 
 by the New York Agricultural Experiment Station, Geneva, New York. The variety 
 fruited first in 1911 and was introduced by the New York State Fruit Testing Association 
 of Geneva in 19 19. 

Plants tall, very vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, very productive, surpassing any 
 other variety yet fruited at this Station, contract mosaic slowly and are but moderate! \-
