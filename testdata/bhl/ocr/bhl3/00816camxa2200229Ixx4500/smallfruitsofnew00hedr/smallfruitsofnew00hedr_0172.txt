 meditun in size, roimdish ovate, dark green, slightly glossy, very rugose, with dentate 
 margins; petiole long, very thick, glabrous, glaucous. Flowers early; pedicels eglandular, 
 with few prickles, glabrous, glaucous; calyx smooth. Fruit early, or early midseason, 
 ships well; large to very large, uniform and retaining size throughout the season, broad- 
 conic, medium red becoming darker when fully ripe but remaining firm, releasing berries 
 readily from the torus which is roughish, slightly pointed or blunt, whitish; drupelets

Orange was raised from seed of Dyack Seedling in 1845 by Dr. W. D. Brinckle of Phila- 
 delphia. For a number of years it was the standard of excellence among raspberries and 
 was widely grown as a family bern,-. It was of the type of the Antwerps, but more vigorous 
 and adapted to a wider range of country. The berry was of a beautiful orange color and 
 possessed a very rich and delicious flavor. It thrived only on cool, moist soils where the 
 sun was not too hot, but required winter protection. The softness of the fruit prevented its 
 becoming a general market berry. In 1854 the American Pomological Society placed it 
 in its list of varieties promising well and in 1856 it was placed in the fruit catalog of the 
 Society where it still remains. Dr. Brinckle stated that Orange generally reproduced 
 itself from seed. Seedlings occasionally appeared with circular leaves, and although 
 having perfect flowers, they never bore fruit. Plants not vigorous, dwarfish, slender, 
 tender to cold, very productive in favorable locations; canes light gray; prickles white; 
 fruit large, ovate; drupelets above medium in size, very soft, juicy; color a beautiful 
 orange-pink; flavor and quality of the best; early. 

Orange d'Automne. i. Fish Hardy-Fr. Bk. 276. 1882. 

Canes sturdy and productive; fruit large, bright orange, firm, juicy, richly flavored. 

Oronoco. i. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 161. 1920. 

Introduced by the Morris & Snow Seed Company, Los Angeles, California, in 1914. 
 Said to have come from wild plants brought from the Oronoco River region in South America. 
 Described as evergreen and a strong grower, bearing clusters of large yellow fruit of good 
 quality. 

Osceola, i. Mich. Sta. Bid. 111:47. i894- 

Originated in Osceola County, Iowa, and reported in 1881 as a soft and very hardy 
 variety. 

Owasco. I. AT. F. Sto. £«/. 497:16, PI. 1923. 

The fruits of Owasco are the largest and handsomest red raspberries grown on the 
 Station groimds. The berries are quite as good as they look, and if product alone were 
 to be considered, one could say that Owasco is the nearest approach to perfection of any 
 red raspberry. Unfortunately it fails somewhat in its plant characters. Thus, it is a poor
