plant maker, and, therefore, hard to propagate; again, it is variable in habit of growth; 
 lastly, it is not as hardy as some of the standard sorts, although it is sufficiently hardy 
 for the great berr\' regions of New York. Owasco is distinguished among other varieties 
 when not in fruit by its large, coarse leaves which are very light in color. The berries are 
 easily distinguished by their large size and conic shape. As the fruits ship and keep well, 
 it is a most promising new commercial red raspberry. Owasco is a cross between Jime and 
 Cuthbert which originated at the New York Agricultural Experiment Station, Geneva, 
 New York, in igii. It was introduced by the New York State Fruit Testing Association, 
 Geneva, in 1922.
