Pamell. i. Ohio Hort. Soc. Rpt. 57. 1868. 2. A^. 1'. Sta. Rpt. 226. 1883. 

Said to have been raised from seed of Four Seasons Red by a Mr. Pamell, Cincinnati, 
 Ohio, about 1867. From conflicting reports as to its behavior it is probable that the stock 
 was mixed. Plants vigorous, hardy, and productive; foliage subject to sunburn; fruit 
 medium in size, roundish conic, bright red, firm; good. 

Parry No. i. i. Horticulturist 24:273. 1869. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:684. 1893. 

Raised from seed by William Parry, Parry, New Jersey, and sent out by him for trial 
 about 1867. It was never named, as further trials proved it inferior to standard varieties. 
 Plants strong, vigorous, and upright; fruit of medium size, firm, juicy, mildly subacid; 
 good; late. 
 Parry No. 2. i. Horticulturist 24:273. 1869. 2. A''. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:684. 1893. 

Of the same origin as the preceding; not named. Plants vigorous and upright; fruit 
 large, firm, moderately juicy, mildly subacid; very good; late. 

Pearl, i. Fuller Sm. Fr. Cult. 154. 1867. 2. Card. Man. 21:175. 1879. 

A berry of unknown origin which was cultivated around Philadelphia about 1870. 
 It was very similar to Brandywine and some growers considered them identical. William 
 Parry states that Pearl differs from Brandywine in that the foliage starts growth a week 
 Jater, the plant is less vigorous, and the fruit of Pearl is smaller. Plants short, stocky, 
 seldom over three feet high; suckers very numerous; prickles nimierous, long, slender, 
 tinged purplish; fruit of medium size, round, light bright red, moderately firm, juicy, sweet 
 with an agreeable flavor. 

Peerless, i. Will Nur. Cat. 75. 1919- 

Originated about 1914 with John W. Millet, Bismarck, North Dakota, from a lot of 
 mixed seedlings; introduced in 19 19 as the Peerless Climbing by Oscar H. Will & Company, 
 Bismarck, North Dakota. As grown here Peerless is not equal to standard varieties. 
 Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, productive; suckers very numerous; canes 
 stocky, green with an occasional reddish tinge, sHghtly glaucous; prickles few, slender, 
 weak, reddish; fruit medium in size, somewhat variable, roundish conic; drupelets 
 medium in size and number, strongly coherent, dark red, slightly glossy, medium jioicy, 
 firm, mildly subacid; good; late midseason. 
 Pennsylvanian. i. Prince Pom. Ma». 2:167. 1832- 

Obtained by William Prince from a London nursery under the name Rtdms pennsyU 
 vanicus; he later found it identical with plants received from the forests of Maine. Canes 
 of young shoots covered with red hairs extending from base to tip, very productive, fre- 
 quently producing an autumn crop ; fruit dark red, oval and of indifferent flavor.

 prior to 1904. The variety received an award of merit from the Royal Horticultural 
 Society in 1904. It is grown occasionally in the southwest of England. Leaves with
