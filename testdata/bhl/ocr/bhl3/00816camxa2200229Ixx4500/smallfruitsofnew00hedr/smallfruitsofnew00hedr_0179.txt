THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK I3I 

Percy. Occidentalis x Strigosus. i. Can. Exp. Farms Rpt. 109. 1900. 2. N. Y. Sta. 
 Bid. 278: 124. 1906. 
 A seedling of Gregg by Cuthbert which originated with Dr. William Saunders, Ottawa, 
 Canada. As grown at their station it is inferior for commercial purposes. Plants vigorous, 
 fairly hardy, productive; fruit above medium in size, darker and softer than Shaffer and 
 inclined to crumble; not equal to Shaffer in flavor and quality; midseason. 

Perfection, i. U. S. D. A. Pom. Rpt. 394. i8gi. 

There are two Perfection red raspberries; one comes from New York and is now grown 
 little or not at all, because of its susceptibility to the mosaic disease; the other comes from 
 Wisconsin and is the subject of this discussion. Perfection was once widely grown because 
 of productiveness and large, handsome fruits, but is being discarded because it is very 
 susceptible to the mosaic disease and because the fruits are too soft and too much inclined 
 to crumble to make a good commercial red raspberry. Perfection was originated by 
 F. W. Loudon, Janesville, Wisconsin, about thirty years ago as a cross between Cuthbert 
 and Turner. 

Plants above medium in height, vigorous, upright, very hardy, lack in health, appar- 
 ently contracting mosaic rapidly, moderately injured, susceptible to cane-blight; propa- 
 gated by suckers; prickles mmierous, stocky, green changing to dull light red or greenish 
 brown, glabrous, heavily glaucous; prickles slender, weak, few; leaflets 3-5, rather small, 
 long-oval, thick, glabrous, rugose, with serrate margins; petiole long, thick, with few prickles, 
 slightly pubescent. Flowers small, in prickly clusters; pedicels short, pubescent, glandular. 
 Fruit early midseason or earlier, injured by drouth; large to medium, regular, hemis- 
 pherical, dull, dark red, clinging a little too tenaciously to the torus which is large and 
 roughish; drupelets large, irregular, cohering weakly so that the berries sometimes crumble; 
 flesh a little soft, tender, juicy, not very aromatic, sprightly; quality fair to good. 

Perfection (of New York), i. N. J. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 128. 1913. 

This variety is a chance seedling found in 1900 by A. H. Grefe, Marlboro, New York, 
 who named and introduced it in 19 10. It is well liked in eastern New York because of the 
 vigor, productiveness, and hardiness of plants, but is being discarded because of suscepti- 
 biUty to the mosaic disease. Fruit large, bright red, rather soft, inclined to crumble; good. 

Perpetuelle de BiUiard. i. Guide Prat. 21. 1895. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 278:121. 1906. 
 Raised about 1868 by Charles Billiard, a nurseryman at Fontenay-aux-Roses, France. 
 As grown at this Station from plants imported by the United States Department of Agri- 
 culture it is not equal to other sorts for this climate. Plants moderately vigorous, hardy 
 and moderately productive; fruit large, soft, attractive red; good flavor and quality; 
 autumn-fruiting according to European descriptions. 

Perry Golden, i. Mich. Sta. Bui. 142:159. 1897. 

On trial at the Michigan Station in 1897 and said to be similar to Golden Queen. 

Philadelphia. Strigosus x Occidentalis. 1. Mag. Hort. 29:^60. 1863. 2. Fuller 5m. Fr. 
 Cwft. 147, fig. 1867. 3. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:6&4. 1893. 
 The origin of this variety is in doubt, but it is supposed to have been found in the wild, 
 near Philadelphia, about 1840. It was first grown extensively on the light soils of southern
