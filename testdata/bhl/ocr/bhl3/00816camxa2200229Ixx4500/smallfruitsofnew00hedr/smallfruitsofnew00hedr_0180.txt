New Jersey and did not attract much attention until about 1866, when its culture began 
 to spread. Until about 1880 it was a leading market variety. Its widespread popularity 
 was due to hardiness, heavy bearing, and adaptation to a wide range of soils and climates. 
 The berries lacked firmness, were inclined to crumble, and the quality was not high. Phila- 
 delphia was placed in the catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1869 and remained 
 in the last catalog of 1909. Plants tall, vigorous, branching, hardy, very productive; 
 suckers few; canes stocky, purplish, branching; prickles very few, very small; leaflets 
 large, dark green, thick, tough, with a peculiar wavy appearance on the upper side; fruit 
 above medium in size, roundish, dark red, with very little bloom; drupelets large, coher- 
 ing well, rather soft, lacking juiciness, mildly subacid; season long.
