 ductive; fruit of medium size, firm; good quality; late. 

Rancocas. 1. Rural N. Y. 43:635- 1884. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:685- 1893. 

A chance seedling fovmd on the fann of Albert Hansell, Rancocas, New Jersey, in 1877. 
 William H. Moon, Morrisville, Pennsylvania, introduced it in 1884. As grown at this 
 Station its chief characteristic was its earliness. The entire crop ripened in a few days. 
 Plants dwarfish, weak, unproductive; suckering freely; foliage pale green; fruit small to 
 medium, soft, juicy, of fair flavor; very early.

Introduced as an everbearing red raspberry, Ranere is chiefly valuable for spring 
 bearing, most of the crop being borne in early summer. It appears in some of the nursery 
 catalogs as the earliest of all red raspberries, but it is later than June and one or two other 
 sorts on the grounds of this Station. Aside from its being a double-cropper, there is not 
 much to recommend the variety. The berries run small, are mediocre in quality, and are 
 variable in both size and color. The plants are hardy, usually vigorous, but very suscep- 
 tible to crown-gall. Ranere is supposed to have originated in New Jersey a score or more 
 of years ago and was grown for a time by a colony of Italian gardeners. About 1912, the 
 J. T. Lovett Nursery Company, Little Silver, New Jersey, introduced the variety under 
 the name St. Regis. It has since been advertised by many nurserymen under both names, 
 although now the name "St. Regis " is rarely used. 

Plants of medium height and vigor, attractive in appearance, rather upright, hardy, 
 lacking somewhat in productiveness, unusually healthy, contracting mosaic very slowly 
 and but moderately injured; autumn-bearing; propagated by suckers; canes numerous, 
 slender, green changing to greenish brown, glabrous, thinly glaucous, with a few glands 
 at the tips; prickles small, slender, weak, medium in number, purplish; leaflets 3-5, large, 
 oval, very attractive dark green, dull, rugose, with finely dentate margins; petiole long, 
 slightly prickly, with a few glands. Flowers very early; pedicels slightly glandular and 
 pubescent; cal>TC prickly. Fruit very early; rather small and variable in size, seldom if 
 ever large, hemispherical, glossy, bright red; drupelets of medium size, cohering poorly, 
 the berries often cnimbling, rather soft but variable, mild and insipid; quality poor unless 
 well grown. 

Rapid City. i. S. Dak. Sta. Bui. 104:290. 1907. 

A wild red raspberry from the Black Hills of South Dakota used by Prof. N. E. Hansen 
 of the South Dakota Experiment Station in his breeding work. Its seedlings are fairly 
 hardy and all bear fruits of good quality. 

Reader Perfection, i. Jour. Pom. & Hort. Set. 3:32. 1922. 

A new variety in England considered worthy of trial on the less fertile raspberry soils 
 in that country. Plants vigorous and productive; canes numerous, stout, nearly erect, 
 green with purplish tinges, moderately glaucous, glabrous; prickles moderately numerous,
