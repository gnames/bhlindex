 Mentioned in a list of recommended sorts in the Genesee Farmer for 1838. Dochnahl 
 describes it as similar to the wild R. idaeits of Europe but with fruits lighter in color, less 
 aromatic, soft and not keeping long; plants very productive, sometimes fruiting in 
 September.

 Red Antwerp was described by Brookshaw in 181 7 as a new variety, having been first 
 raised by a person named Comwell, Bamet, in Middlesex, England. It probably originated 
 prior to 1800 as it was listed by Sickler in 1802, and was known in this country by McMahon 
 in 1806. In Europe it has long been a standard variety and was grown considerably in 
 this coimtry until about 1850 when native sorts better adapted to the climate began to 
 take its place. It is still grown on the Pacific Coast as a companion to Cuthbert and in 
 Washington it is more productive than that variety. The terra Antwerp has been applied 
 to many sorts, and Downing wrote in the Horticulturist in 1846 that the true Red Antwerp 
 was little known except around Boston and New York, many cultivators having a small 
 and indifferent sort imder that name. Most of our varieties having R. idaeus blood are 
 probably derived from Red Antwerp. As grown in England the stock of this variety is 
 badly mLxed. Hogg, in 1866, mentioned that there were several forms of this variety, 
 differing more or less from each other both in the fruit and the canes. In 1922 N. H. Grubb 
 of the East Mailing Research Station, found six distinct sorts bearing this name. He was 
 imable to determine which was the original Red Antwerp. In this country it was early, 
 productive, of fine quaUty and tender to cold, requiring winter protection north of the 
 latitude of Philadelphia. It was placed in the catalog of the American Pomological 
 Society in 1852, removed in 1862, returned to the list in 1897, where it remained in the 
 last list of the Society in 1909. 

Canes strong, long, yellowish green, slightly glaucous, occasionally tinged purple, 
 covered below with dark brown prickles, which decrease in quantity upwards; in the 
 autumn the canes become entirely brown sooner than those of others; bearing wood vig- 
 orous, and nearly smooth; leaves large, slightly rugose, plaited, irregularly serrated, dark 
 green; fruit large, conical, dark red; drupelets middle sized; flavor rich and sweet. 

Red Cane. i. Mag. Hort. 24:420. 1858. 2. Mich. Sta. Bui. 111:54. 1894. 

At one time a favorite market variety near Hartford, Connecticut. In the Magazine 
 of Horticulture for 1858 it is thought to be the same as the American Red, but Crozier, 
 in Michigan Station Bulletin 11 1, thinks it may have been either the Red Antwerp or 
 the Hudson River Antwerp.
