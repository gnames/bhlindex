 here it is inferior to Shaffer and Columbian. Plants vigorous, hardy, moderately 
 productive; fruit small, dull, unattractive purple, moderately firm; fair in flavor and 
 quality. 

Reeder. i. Card. Mon. 24:116. 1882. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:685. 1893. 

A chance seedling found in a field of other sorts by a Mr. Reeder, Stevensville, Michi- 
 gan, about 1875. It never became of much importance as the berries crumbled badly for 
 a market variety. Plants vigorous, with few slender prickles; fruit of medium size, 
 roundish, bright red, firm, juicy, crumbly; very good; late midseason, ripening over a 
 long period. 

Reliance. Strigosus x Occidentalis. i. Cult. & Count Gent. 40:470. 1876. 2. A^. Y. 
 Sta. Bui. 278:685. 1893. 
 Reliance is a descendant of Philadelphia, several generations removed. It was grown 
 from seed by O. L. Felton, Merchantville, New Jersey, who exhibited it as a new variety 
 at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876. For a while it was popular but 
 as it was not enough of an advance over the Philadelphia to compete with other sorts, it 
 soon went out. Beach described the plants as of Strigosus type, but it is listed among the 
 purple raspberries by the American Pomological Society. The Society placed Reliance 
 in its fruit list in 1881 and it still remained in the last catalog in 1909. Plants vigorous, 
 hardy, moderately productive; fruit below medium in size, dark red, soft, juicy, sweet; 
 very good; midseason.
