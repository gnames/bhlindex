 A chance seedling which originated about 1896 with L. E. Wardell, Marlboro, New 
 York, who introduced it in 1903. Said to be a seedling of Marlboro which it resembles, 
 differing from that variety in being more productive and bearing firmer fruit. It is grown 
 somewhat in the Hudson Valley and in New England, being considered desirable to grow 
 with Cuthbert. As grown at this Station the fruit is not especially attractive nor is the 
 quality high. It was placed in the catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1909. 
 Plants medium in height and vigor, upright, fairly hardy, productive; suckers medium in 
 nimiber; canes medium to stocky, yellowish brown, glabrous; prickles mediimi in number, 
 slender, weak ; fruit of medium size, conic ; drupelets medium in size, cohering well, bright 
 red, firm, juicy, sweet; good; early.
