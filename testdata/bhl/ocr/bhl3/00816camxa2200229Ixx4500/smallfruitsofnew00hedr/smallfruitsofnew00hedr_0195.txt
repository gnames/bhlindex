THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK I4I 

The description of Cayuga answers for that of Seneca if the following exceptions be noted. 
 The plants of Seneca are not so tall, are usually markedly stockier in cane; and have fewer 
 and smaller prickles. The flowers bloom early, in June, a few days later than those of 
 Ca}-uga. The fruit is a little later than that of Cayuga and a little earher than that of 
 Cuthbert. The berries in appearance and quality can hardly be distinguished from those 
 of Cayuga, although upon close inspection it is seen that the drupelets of Seneca are larger 
 and the shape is a little more conical. The quality of the two fruits is much the same, 
 the only difference being more sprightliness in Seneca. Seneca is recommended to precede 
 and to take the place of Cuthbert. Fruit growers will want to know how these two 
 new berries compare with Cuthbert in susceptibility to mosaic, tlie disease which now 
 threatens to destroy commercial berry growing in America. No differences can be noted 
 in the three varieties in this respect. Seneca originated at the New York Agricultural 
 Experiment Station, at Geneva, in 19 11, as a cross between June and Cuthbert. The 
 variety was distributed by the New York State Fruit Testing Association, Geneva, 
 New York, in 1922.

Shaffer was the first purple raspberry to meet with the approbation of berry growers 
 and was for many years the most prized of the hybrids. It has been nearly superseded 
 by Columbian, which resembles but surpasses Shaffer in several qualities as was noted 
 in the discussion of Columbian. It is still grown somewhat for canning in berry-canning 
 regions. But the berries have a tendency to go to pieces in the can, and shrink more than 
 those of some other purple sorts. Shaffer is propagated most by tips, as it does not 
 sucker. The plants are less hardy than those of several other hybrid kinds. This old 
 variety originated with George Shaffer, Scottsville, New York, about 1871, as a chance 
 seedling. It was introduced in 1S7S. The American Pomological Society added Shaffer 
 to its recommended list of fruits in 1883. 

Plants tall, vigorous, more upright than Columbian, slightly spreading, lacking some- 
 what in hardiness, very productive, contract mosaic slowly, susceptible to anthracnose; 
 propagated by tips; canes somewhat stocky but less so than Columbian, green changing 
 to brownish red, darker than those of Columbian, heavily glaucous; prickles slender, weak, 
 very few, with a tinge of red at the tips; leaflets 3-5, broad-oval, the terminal one often 
 lobed, dull, mediiun to dark green, rugose, with serrate margins; petiole medium in length 
 and thickness, glabrous, glaucous, with almost no prickles. Flowers late; pedicels prickly, 
 glandular, lightly pubescent; calyx prickly. Fruit very late, a little before Columbian; 
 large to very large, broadly hemispherical, dull purple but lighter than Columbian, adheres 
 fairly well to the torus which is roughish and bluntly pointed; drupelets large, rotmd, often
