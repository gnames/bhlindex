144 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

gives Stoever as a synonym of American Red, and the variety is probably a typical wild 
 R. strigosus. Plants very vigorous, with nearly smooth reddish-brown canes when mature, 
 unproductive; fruit large, roimdish conic, bright red, sprightly, with a strong wild flavor. 

Storrie Excelsior Perpetual, i. Card. Chron. 64:98. 1918. 

First brought to notice by Messrs. Storrie & Storrie, Glencarse, Perthshire, England, 
 in 1918 as a large, fine-flavored, autumn-fruiting sort. 

Sucree de Metz. i. Ohio Hort. Soc. Rpt. 32. 1869. 2. Guide Prat. 21. 1895. 

Originated by MM. Simon-Louis Fr^res, Metz, France, who introduced it in 1866. 
 Imported into this country in 1869 by L. Ritz of Ohio. Plants upright, vigorous, very 
 productive; canes pale green, with numerous small prickles; fruit large, elongated, clear 
 yellow, soft, juicy, perfumed; very good; season July to October in France. 

Sugar Hybrid. Strigosus x Occidentalis. i. Burbank Cat. 29. 1893. 

Originated and introduced by Luther Burbank, Santa Rosa, California, as a second- 
 generation seedling of Shaffer by Souhegan. Plants described as tall, slender, productive 
 and almost thomless; fruit large, dark red, very sweet.

 Farmers' Bui. 887:40. 191 7. 
 A cross between a wild red raspberry from Cavalier County, North Dakota, and Shaffer, 
 which was originated by Prof. N. E. Hansen of the South Dakota Experiment Station; 
 introduced by that Station in 1906. Where extreme hardiness and drouth resistance are 
 essential. Sunbeam may be of value, but as grown at this Station, it is inferior to standard 
 sorts in size, color and flavor of fruit. Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, very hardy, 
 productive, propagate by suckers which are very numerous ; canes medium in size, bright 
 red, glaucous, with a medium number of slender prickles; fruit variable in size, averaging 
 below medium, short, roundish; drupelets of medium size and coherence, dark red, moder- 
 ately firm, acid; fair; early. 

Superb. I. W. N. Y. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 23. 1882. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:686. 1893. 

Churchman Superb. 3. Card. Mon. 23:257, PI. 1881. 

Originated about 1874 by John Churchman, Burlington, New Jersey, who sent it out 
 in 1 88 1. It was supposed to be a seedling of Philadelphia and superior to that variety in 
 size of fruit. As grown here it was unproductive, the fruit was too variable in size, and 
 inclined to crumble. The American Pomological Society placed Superb in its catalog in 
 1883 and removed it in 1899. Plants moderately vigorous, hardy, unproductive; suckering 
 slowly; fruit above medium in size, moderately firm; drupelets large, dark red; good; late. 

Superlative, i. Jour. Hort. xy.io^. 1888. 2. 6^ard C/iroK. 3rd Ser. 10:110, 526. 1891.

 As its history shows, Superlative is an old English variety, which has been grown more 
 or less wherever the red raspberry is cultivated. In New York and eastern America the 
 canes are not sufficiently hardy, vigorous, or productive. The variety is highly prized on 
 the Pacific Slope, especially near San Francisco. The fruits, while of the very best quality, 
 are too soft for shipping long distances. The berries are large and of the very best quality. 
 Superlative was raised by a Mr. Merryfield, Waldershare Gardens, Dover, England, about
