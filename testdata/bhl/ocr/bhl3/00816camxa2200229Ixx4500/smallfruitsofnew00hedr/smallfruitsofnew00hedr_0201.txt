1877. It was introduced about 1888 and soon after brought to America by Ellwanger & 
 Barry, Rochester, New York. In 1909 the American Pomological Society placed Super- 
 lative in its list of recommended fruits. 

Plants dwarfish, lacking in vigor, upright, tender to cold, unproductive unless well 
 grown, propagated by suckers; canes numerous, slender, green changing slowly to reddish 
 brown, glabrous, heavily glaucous; prickles small, very short, weak, numerous, dull red; 
 leaflets 3-5, broad-oval, very thick, dark green or bluish green, usually strongly rugose and 
 much curled, w4th coarsely and irregularly dentate margins; petiole long, thick, prickly, 
 pubescent; pedicels thick, stout, medium in length, with few to many rather large prickles; 
 calyx usually without prickles, or rarely few. Fruit medium early; large to very large, 
 long-conic, dark red, too dull to be attractive, adheres strongly to the torus which is small 
 and roughish; drupelets large, round, cohering so that the berries do not crumble; flesh 
 juicy, soft, rich, sprightly, pleasantly aromatic; quality very good to best. 

Superlative Improved. 1. Wash. Sta. Bui. 87:2 i. 1909. 

Described as a new raspberry in western Washington, satisfactory wherever planted. 
 It is said to endure dry summers and cold winters better than most varieties because of its 
 deep-rooting habit. As grown at this Station it seems to be identical with Superlative.
