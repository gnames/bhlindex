Van Fleet. Innominatus x Strigosus. i. U. S. D. A. Dept. Circ. 320:1-13. 1924. 
 2. U. S. D. A. Official Rec. 4:6. 1925. 
 A cross of Rubiis innominatus by Cuthbert, originated in 191 1 by Dr. Walter Van 
 Fleet, Superintendent of the United States Plant Introduction Garden, at Chico, Cali- 
 fornia. Plants were received for trial at this Station in the spring of 1922. As grown here 
 Van Fleet is inferior to standard sorts in size, color, flavor and shipping quaUty of fruit. 
 It may be of value as a parent in breeding late varieties. It endures hot weather and is 
 recommended especially for the southern states where the red varieties fail. Plants tall, 
 vigorous, upright to slightlj- spreading, not fully hardy, moderately productive; suckers 
 rather few, propagates by tips; canes stocky, numerous, reddish, glaucous, glabrous, with 
 eglandular tips; prickles medium in ntmiber, short, slender; leaflets medium green, dull, 
 flat, heavily tomentose below; flowers small, rose-colored, verj^ late; fruit below medium in 
 size, imiform, broadly roimdish ; drupelets medium in size and number, dull light red, tender, 
 juicy, mildly subacid, lacking character; fair; very late. 

Vermont, i. A''. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:691. 1893. 

A seedling of Champlain originated by L. M. Macomber, North Ferrisburg, Vermont; 
 introduced about 1893. It was placed in the catalog of the American Pomological Society 
 in 1901 and remained in the last catalog in 1909. Plants of the Idaeus type; fruit large, 
 pale yellow, with white bloom, very soft, juicy and of the highest quality. 

Victoria, i. Mag. Hort. 7:287. 1841. 2, Downing Fr. Trees Am. 518. 1845. 

Introduced from England about 1841. Similar to Red Antwerp in size and flavor of 
 fruit and excels it in productiveness. 

Victory, i. Baldwin Cat. 20, fig. 1919. 2. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 162. 1920. 

Victory is said to be a Cuthbert seedling. On the grounds of this Station the varieties 
 are seemingly identical. The description of Cuthbert answers for the two varieties. Were 
 it not for the certainty with which its origination is stated, one knowing the two varieties 
 would not hesitate to say that Victory is Cuthbert renamed. Victory originated about 
 1910 with A. J. Hartung, Onekama, Michigan, and introduced in 1918 by 0. A. D. Baldwin, 
 Bridgman, Michigan.
