 vigor and the fruit is too small and unattractive. Plants of medium height and vigor, 
 upright, hardy and productive; suckers medium in number; canes slender, green, glabrous, 
 heavily glaucous, with glandular tips; prickles small, slender, few; flowers early; fruit below 
 medium in size, roundish conic ; drupelets medium in size, cohering strongly, medium red, 
 moderately juicy, mild, sweet; early.
