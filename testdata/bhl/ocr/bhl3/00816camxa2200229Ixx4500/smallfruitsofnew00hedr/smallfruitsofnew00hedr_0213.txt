Gregg, but unfortunately has a somewhat shorter season. Black Pearl is about the best 
 raspberry for cold climates, and, on the other hand, stands hot, dry summers as well as 
 any other sort. Black Pearl was found as a chance seedling in a plantation of Kansas 
 in 1905 by Herman Krumrei, St. Joseph, Missouri. The variety was introduced by Hol- 
 singer Brothers, Rosedale, Kansas, in 1907. 

Plants above mediimi height, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, very productive, 
 variable in health, susceptible to anthracnose; canes very stocky, dull brownish red, heavily 
 glaucous; prickles numerous, slender, strong; leaflets usually 3, broadly lanceolate, small, 
 luxuriant dark green, rugose, with finely serrate margins; petiole rather long, of medium 
 thickness, glabrous, prickly. Flowers early; pedicels very short, pubescent. Fruit early, 
 ships well, appears to withstand drouth exceptionally well; large but variable, hemis- 
 pherical, glossy glack, adheres fairiy well to the torus; drupelets rather small, cohering
