For many years Cumberland was the most widely and most commonly grown black 
 raspberry-. The assets which gave it high standing were productiveness and hardiness of 
 plant, and large size and high quality of fruit. The fruits are especially firm, and therefore 
 in favor with shippers. The berries hold their size well until the close of the season. It is 
 now losing in popularity because of susceptibility to anthracnose, the streak disease, and 
 rosette. Cumberland originated with David Miller, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, and after 
 having been grown locally for some years was introduced in 1896. In 1899 the American 
 Pomological Society added Cumberland to its fruit catalog list. The variety was sup- 
 posed to be a seedling of Gregg but this origin is doubtful. 

Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, unusually hardy, very productive, susceptible 
 to anthracnose and rosette, contract streak disease rapidly ; canes smooth, greenish changing 
 to light reddish brown, heavily glaucous; prickles large, long, thick, strong, very numerous, 
 greenish; leaflets 3 to 5, of medium size, broadly ovate, rugose, with dentate margins; 
 petiole medium in length and thickness, prickly, glabrous, glaucous. Flowers early; 
 pedicels prickly, pubescent; calyx smooth. Fruit early midseason, ships well, usually 
 holds up in size to the close of the season ; large, conical, attractive black, clings well to the 
 short, small, roundish torus, although the berry is released readily, heavily glaucous; 
 drupelets large, round, with strong coherence so that the berries do not crumble; flesh 
 juicy, firm, sweet, rich; quality very good.

Griggs Daily Bearing. 2. Ohio Hort. Soc. Rpt. 42. 1867.
