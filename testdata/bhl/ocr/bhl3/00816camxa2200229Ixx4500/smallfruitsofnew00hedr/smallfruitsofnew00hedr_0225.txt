than of any other variety. The serious faults which mar the plants are : They are suscep- 
 tible to rosette, anthracnose and streak disease; they winter kill badly where several other 
 varieties are perfectly hardy; they are adapted to comparatively few soils; they make a 
 late growth which sometimes does not mature in short seasons; and they require a rich soil 
 and high cultivation to induce even average productivity. The parent plant of this variety 
 was found growing wild in a ravine on the farm of R. & P. Gregg, Ohio County, Indiana, 
 in 1866. The American Pomological Society added Gregg to its fruit catalog list 
 in 1879. 

Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, ripen their wood late in the fall, somewhat 
 tender to cold, variable in 3aeld, not very healthy, susceptible to rosette, anthracnose and 
 the streak disease; canes medium to thick, numerous, dull brown, variable in amount of 
 bloom; prickles of average thickness, strong, rather few, brownish; leaflets quite large, 
 3-5, usually 3, with the lower two often lobed, oval, thick, attractive dark green, rugose, 
 with serrate margins; petiole medium in length and thickness, slightly prickly, glabrous. 
 Flowers late, numerous, in clusters near the tips of the branches; pedicels short, very prickly; 
 calyx small, pubescent. Fruit late, quite susceptible to injury by unfavorable weather 
 conditions; large to very large, broadly hemispherical, black with tinge of purple and 
 with hea\^ bloom ; drupelets large, round, usually cohering strongly, yet crumbling on some 
 soils; flesh juicy, firm, rich and highly flavored but variable; quality usually good.

Sent out for trial in 1888 by G. H. & J. H. Hale, South Glastonbury, Connecticut, 
 but pro\'ing inferior to other sorts was never introduced. Plants vigorous, unproductive; 
 fniit of medium size, firm, seedy, sweet; very good; early midseason.

Discovered in the wild in 1867 by a Mr. Hamilton, Bartlett Station, Tennessee, who 
 brought it under cultivation. Fruit large, sweet.

Extra Late. 2. Ibid. 394. 1891. 

Sent to the Pomologist of the United States Department of Agriculture in 1891 by 
 W. J. Bradt, North Hannibal, New York, under the name E.Ktra Late, which was changed 
 to Hannibal at the suggestion of H. E. Van Deman, pomologist. Described by him as 
 vigorous, productive ; fruit large, roimdish oblate ; drupelets numerous, regular, black, with- 
 out bloom, excellent ; several days later than Gregg. 

Hanover Pink. 

A chance seedling found in a fence comer in 19 19 by Samuel Higgs, Forestville, New 
 York, who propagated it, and sent plants to this Station for trial in 1921. This variety 
 has value only as a ciuiosity, the fruits cnunble, are not high in quaHty and are an unattrac- 
 tive amber color.

A chance seedling found about 1874 by H. S. Harris, Whig Lane, Salem County, New 
 Jersey. In 1891 it was exhibited at a meeting of the American Pomological Society by
