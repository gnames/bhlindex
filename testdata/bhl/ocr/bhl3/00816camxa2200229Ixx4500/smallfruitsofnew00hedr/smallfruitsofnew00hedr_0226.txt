Hawkins Orange, i. Cult. & Count. Gent. 41:470. 1876. 

E.xhibited at the Centennial Exposition in 1876 and described by W. L. Shafifer,

 existing kinds. 

Hilbom. I. Ont. Fr. Gr Assoc. Rpt. 18. 1884. 2. iV. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:674. 1893. 
 A chance seedling which came up in an old plantation of black raspberries on the farm 
 of W. W. Hilbom, Leamington, Ontario, about 1878; introduced in 1886. The variety has 
 considerable merit as a market sort, producing good crops of fairly large, firm, attractive, 
 finely-flavored fruit. The American Pomological Society placed Hilbom in its list of recom- 
 mended varieties in 1889; it remained in the last list in 1909. Plants vigorous, hardy, and 
 producti\'e; fruit medium to large, firm, juicy, sweet; very good; early.

 in the northern district of that State.

 but is more hardy in Minnesota. 

Honeysweet. i. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 161. 1920. 2. Hedrick Cyc. Hardy Fr. 282. 1922. 

As the name suggests, this variety is characterized by its sweetness, â€” a rich, honey- 
 like, distinct flavor, made more delectable by an enticing aroma. The berries are of large 
 size, glossy black, very handsome, so that, with the high quality they are nearly perfect in 
 fruit characters. The crop ripens in early midseason and can be left on the bushes longer 
 than that of most other varieties, keeping so well after maturity that the season's product 
 can be harvested in two pickings. The berries are very good for all culinary purposes, 
 requiring less sugar than most other black raspberries, and are said to make the best evap- 
 orated product. A characteristic of the plants is that they bear their fruits in very compact 
 clusters so that the crop is easily harvested. Unfortunately the plants, while hardy and 
 productive, are highly susceptible to several of the serious ills of black raspberries. The 
 original plant of this variety was found as a chance seedling by A. B. Katkamier on his 
 farm at Macedon, New York, in 191 2. 

Plants above medium in height, vigorous, with upright tendency, hardy, productive, 
 variable in health; canes rather stocky, with thick bloom; prickles of medium length,
