 prior to 1887. It is supposed to be a cross of a seedling and Gregg. Mr. Brackett sent it 
 out about 1890 as Brackett No. loi, later naming it Lotta. It was placed in the fruit list 
 of the American Pomological Society in 1897 and remained in the last list in 1909. Plants

 bling Doolittle in size and quality at summer fruiting, but berries much larger in the autumn 
 crop.

Mammoth Cluster. 2. Horticulturist 23:21 i. 1868. 

This old sort is supposed to have originated near Collinsville, Indiana, prior to 1867. 
 About 1867 A. M. Purdy, Palmyra, New York, began propagating it extensively imder 
 the name Mammoth Cluster. From that time its culture spread rapidly and it soon became 
 the leading blackcap, a position it held until the introduction of the Gregg. Its popularity 
 was due to its vigorous, healthy and productive plants. The fruit was considerably larger 
 than that of the sorts then cultivated. It was generally known as Mammoth Cluster, but 
 the American Pomological Society, recognizing the priority of the name McCormick, 
 placed it upon its fruit catalog list in 187 1 under that name, where it remained in 1909. 
 Plants vigorous, hardy, productive; canes strong with few prickles; fruit of medium size, 
 roundish, black, firm, juicy, rich; good; late midseason.
