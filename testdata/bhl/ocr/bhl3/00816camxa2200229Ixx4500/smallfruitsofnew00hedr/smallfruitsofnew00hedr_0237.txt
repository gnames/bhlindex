With the decline of the evaporation of black raspberries Ohio is passing out. When the 
 evaporation of this fruit was a great industry in New York, Ohio was the variety best suited 
 for this purpose, since it yielded more pounds to a bushel of fresh fruit than any other black 
 raspberry, for the reason that the seeds are large and heavy and the flesh is firm and dry. 
 The fruits, however, are not of high quality, and are not liked either for general market or 
 for canning. The plants are susceptible to the several diseases of this fruit and are quickly 
 injured by drouths. They are very productive, fairly hardy, and are usually vigorous. 
 The variety may be known by the silvery whiteness of the under surface of the leaves 
 and of the stems. Ohio may be a seedling of Doolittle. At any rate it originated about 
 1865 in a bed of Doolittle plants on the farm of Hiram Van Dusen, Palmyra, New York. 
 The American Pomological Society added Ohio to its fruit catalog list in 1883. Ohio 
 should not be confused with Ohio Everbearing of Ohio origin, long since dropped from 
 cultivation. 

Plants of medium height and vigor, upright-spreading, hardy, very productive, suscep- 
 tible to rosette, anthracnose and the streak disease ; canes of medium thickness, light green 
 changing to dull reddish brown, silvery white beneath, heavily glaucous; prickles of medium 
 thickness and strength, numerous, greenish; leaflets 3, of medium size and color, rather 
 small on the bearing canes, very light colored on the under strfaces, ovate, rugose, with 
 serrate margins; petiole slender, glabrous, glaucous. Flowers midseason, numerous; 
 pedicels short, of medium thickness. Fruit midseason, injured by drouth, season short, 
 dries exceptionally well, somewhat seedy; medium to above in size, scarcely ever large, 
 hemispherical, rather dull reddish black changing to an attractive color at maturity, 
 glaucous, clings well but releases readily from the torus which is roughish and rounded; 
 drupelets medium in size, roundish oval, variable in coherence ; flesh but moderately juicy, 
 very firm, seedy, sweet to pleasantly subacid; quality good to very good.

This variety was cultivated as long ago as 1832. It was first recommended to eastern 
 growers by Nicholas Longworth, Cincinnati, Ohio. The American Pomological Society 
 placed Ohio Everbearing in its fruit catalog list in 1862 but dropped it in 1897. For a 
 further discussion of this sort see page 12.

A chance seedling found about 1872 by a Mr. Older, Independence, Iowa. It attained 
 some importance because of the vigor, hardiness and productivity of the plants and the 
 large fruit. It was placed in the catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1897 
 remaining in the last catalog in 1909. Plants trailing, vigorous, hardy, moderately pro- 
 ductive; frviit large, glossy, black, without bloom, firm, moderately juicy, rich subacid; 
 midseason.

A seedling of Gregg by Tyler raised in 1884 by Charles Mills, Fairmount, New York. 
 It was sent out as Mills No. 7, and in 1894 was named Onondaga. As grown at this Station
