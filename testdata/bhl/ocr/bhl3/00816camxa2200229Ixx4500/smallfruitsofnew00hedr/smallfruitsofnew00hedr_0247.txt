Sweet Golden, i. Wis. Sta. Biil. 72:21. 1899. 

A yellow-fruited blackcap received at the Wisconsin Station in 1893 from C. A. Sher- 
 wood, Whitehall, Wisconsin. Fruit small, dull, unattractive, sweet, mild. 

Sweet Home. i. Card. Mon. 22:111. 1880. 

A seedling of Lum Everbearing which originated in Illinois and was considered 
 better than McCormick by some. In most places the plant lacks vigor, productiveness 
 and size. 

Thompson Sweet, i. Mass. Sta. Bui. 2:2^. 1888. 

On trial at the Massachusetts Station in 1888 where the plants were weak, not hardy, 
 unproductive; fruit small, firm; good; early. 

Townsend No. 2. i. A^. Y. Sta. Bui. 91:202. 1895. 

Plants were received at this Station in 1894 for trial from George Townsend, Gordon, 
 Ohio, who raised the variety from seed of Gregg. It proved inferior to standard sorts, 
 the fruit being unattractive and inclined to crumble. Plants vigorous, hardy, productive; 
 fruit medium in size, black with heavy bloom, firm, crumbly, seedy, sweet; good. 

Tye. I. Will Cat. 97. 1921. 

Brought into cultivation from the wild by Otis A. Tye, Price, North Dakota. Intro- 
 duced in 192 1 by the Oscar H. Will Company, Bismarck, North Dakota, and said by them 
 to be of value onh" for its hardiness. 

Tyler, i. Mich. Hort. Soc. Rft. 360. 1882. 

A chance seedling found growing among plants of McCormick and Seneca prior to 
 1876 on the grounds of Nathan Tyler, Auburn, New York. It was introduced about 1878 
 by Robert Johnson, Shortsville, New York, who named the variety Tyler. This variety 
 is almost identical with Sotihegan, differing from that sort in the fruit being a little later 
 and the plants more vigorous and resistant to spring frosts. The American Pomological 
 Society placed Tyler in its catalog in 1883 ; it remained in the last catalog in 1909. Plants 
 vigorous, hardy and very productive; fruit of medium size, handsome jet black without 
 bloom, firm, juicy; good; early.

A chance seedling found in a strawberry bed by Thomas R. Hunt, Sr., Lambertville, 
 New Jersey, in 1910; introduced in 192 1 by Thomas R. Hunt, Jr., of the same place. As 
 grown at this Station from plants received in 1922, it seems to be a promising variety. 
 The berries are very firm and attractive and the plants healthy and productive. Plants 
 tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, apparently hardy, verj' productive; canes stocky, green, 
 heavily glaucous; prickles very numerous, thick, strong; fruit tmiformly large, some berries 
 of irregtilar shape, roundish; drupelets medium in number, large, cohering strongly; glossy 
 black with moderate amount of bloom, moderately juicy, very firm, sUghtly seedy, subacid; 
 good; late midseason. 

Virginia, i. Mich. Sta. Bui. 88:11. 1892. 

The Cleveland Nursery Company, Rio Vista, Virginia, sent plants to the Michigan 

Station for trial, where after several years test it failed to show much merit. Plants weak,
