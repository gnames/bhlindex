THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 1 85 

I have examined many works with a view to ascertain if there ever has 
 been any improvement on the well-known wild varieties, but without 
 success. The Double Flowering, Dwarf or Dewberry, American Upright, 
 and the White Fruited, are all that are named. The Dewberry is the first 
 to ripen, and the best flavored fruit. The White Fruited seems to be cul- 
 tivated as a novelty more than for fruit. The Upright variety fruits late 
 in the season, is of vigorous growth, and tmder favorable circumstances 
 produces large, mulberry-shaped berries, but the seeds are not thickly 
 imbedded in the pulp, and are so abimdant as to impair materially the 
 quality of the fruit. The blackberry seems to adhere to its original char- 
 acter with singular tenacity; or, from the many millions of plants which 
 spring up from seeds annually distributed in almost every diversity of 
 climate and soil, we should constantly find new varieties. Improving the 
 wild plant by careful cultivation is one thing; to produce a new variety is 
 another. The fruit now before you I believe to be of the last-named 
 character. It is not like the Dewberry, or long and mulberry-shaped like 
 the Upright blackberry, and the seeds are so imbedded in a rich pulp as hardly 
 to be noticed. I think in shape and size they compare very well with the 
 Hovey Seedling strawberry. The New Rochelle blackberry sends up annually 
 large and vigorous shoots with lateral branches, all of which, imder common 
 cultivation, will be crowded with fine fruit, a portion of which ripens daily 
 in moist seasons for six weeks, commencing about the middle of July. 
 They are perfectly hardy, always thrifty and productive, and I have not 
 foiind them liable to blight or injury by insects.' " 

Accompanying the account was a large basket of the new blackberry, 
 many of which, according to the reporter of the meeting, who evidently 
 had a vivid imagination, were three or four inches in circumference. But 
 at any rate the fruit and the talk of the introducer so pleased the club that 
 they voted to change the name of the berry from AVct' Rochelle to Lawton, 
 an action provocative of great agitation in the two leading horticultural 
 organizations of the country for over a decade. The Western New York 
 Horticultiiral Society held that the first name, New Rochelle, should stand 
 in accordance with the rule of priority, and in 1856 a formal vote was 
 passed to emphasize its position. Later, in the same year, the American 
 Pomological Society voted that the berry should be called Lawton. Might 
 not right prevailed, and more and more the berry became known as Lawton. 
 It remains to be said that for twenty years following its introduction. Law- 
 ton was the leading blackberry of the coimtry, displaced in popularity by 
 Kittatinny in the early seventies. 

The history of the Dorchester, first named among its kind, is scarcely 
 less complicated than that of the Lawton. Two men are credited with its
