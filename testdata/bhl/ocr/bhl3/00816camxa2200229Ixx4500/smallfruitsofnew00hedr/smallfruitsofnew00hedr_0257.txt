THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 1 87 

of bramble fruits There are, however, a few types markedly different 
 from the blackberries commonly cultivated that need further discussion. 

WHITE BLACKBERRIES 

Among the first varieties of blackberries introduced were several white 
 variations, one of which, the Needham, introduced about 1850, was grown 
 for several years rather widely. From that time to this nurserymen have 
 advertised albino sorts, none of which, however, have ever become more 
 than garden curiosities. The plants as a rtile, lack vigor and the berries 
 are never quite up to the mark in size or flavor. The stems throughout are 
 usually greenish yellow, and the fruits are small and creamy white or amber 
 colored. These sports seem to be most common in Rubus allegheniensis 
 but occur in other species as well. They are not uncommon in wild plants, 
 and few who have had much experience in picking the wild fruits have not 
 chanced upon clumps of the white form growing among the normal blacks. 
 There seem to be no records of white blackberries in breeding experiments. 
 There has never been a white variation among the several hundred crosses 
 and hybrids grown on the grounds of this Station. 

THORNLESS BLACKBERRIES 

From the beginning of attempts to domesticate the blackberry, growers 
 have been looking for a thomless sort. A blackberry plant in its armament 
 of thorns is the most vicious inhabitant of the fruit farm. Clothes, hands, 
 and temper suffer in blackberry picking Now and then thomless mutations 
 are found among wild plants, and several thomless varieties have been 
 offered by nurserymen. None, however, have proved of much value in 
 the garden. Of the dozen thomless varieties that have been grown on the 
 grounds of this Station, thomlessness has been correlated with two serious 
 defects,â€” small, poorly flavored fmits, and plants tender to cold. The 
 plants of all have been exceedingly vigorous, but none have been noteworthy 
 for productiveness. It remains to be said that one wild species, Rubus 
 canadensis, long known as Rubus millspaughii, is thomless or nearly so. 
 There are not as yet cultivated varieties of this species, but it is being used 
 as a parent at this Station in crosses with cultivated sorts with the hope 
 that out of the progeny, which has not yet frtdted, a thomless sort better 
 than those that have yet appeared may arise. Bailey' gives an interesting 
 account of this species which we reprint in part.
