196 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

" In conclusion, we will state that it is our conviction that these fruits 
 will meet with a cordial reception by the public, and for private gardens 
 be preferred to the rank-growing high blackberries; in the market they will 
 readily command a higher price than any other blackberry, but as their 
 season is so much earlier they will not come greatly into competition. For 
 a table fruit they are very fair — sweet, juicy and luscious — no setting of 
 the teeth on edge." 

Little, however, seems to have come from Dr. Miner's dewberries. 
 They were discussed in the Fruit Growers' Society of Western New York; 
 mentioned in several of the agricultural papers of the country and even 
 received some praise in the Gardeners Chronicle published in England. 
 But Dr. Miner did not push the sale of plants and eventually they seem to 
 have been lost sight of although more or less cultivated for twenty or thirty 
 years under the name Miner's Seedlings. 

The first dewberry to receive wide recognition seems to have been the 
 Bartel, brought to notice by Dr. Bartel, Huey, Clinton County, Illinois. 
 L. H. Bailey,' who has given the early history of dewberries much attention, 
 gives the following history of the Bartel in a bulletin of the Cornell Experi- 
 ment Station. 

" The story goes that the plants appeared in an old cornfield upon his 
 farm, and some of the berries were so large that he conceived the idea 
 of selling plants. He procured a lithograph of the berries — which did 
 ample justice to the fruit, — described the methods of growing them and 
 for a time disposed of considerable stock. The introducer was an old 
 man at this time and was one of those clever and picturesque individuals 
 who often lend an interest to a neighborhood. The first printed record 
 of this berry appeared in December, 1875, in Purdy's Fruit Recorder (p. 182). 
 This is a communication from ' T. C. Bartles, of Clinton Co., Illinois,' and 
 is headed ' Bartles' Mammoth Dewberry.'- The description of the berry 
 runs as follows: * This is a very fine berry, ripening from the last of Jione 
 imtil the middle of August. The fruit is very large, rich and juicy, slightly 
 acid, but not so sour as the blackberry. When ripe it is black, and is suffi- 
 ciently solid to bear shipment with safety. I have had berries over two 
 inches in length and one inch in diameter. They are a perpetual bearer, 
 from the time they begin to ripen (in ordinary seasons) until the last of 
 August — having blossoms on the same vine simultaneously with the ripe 
 fruit. They are very prolific, yielding in a fair season from sixty to eighty 

' Cornell Sta. Bui. 34:300. 1891. 

2 The name of this dewberry is variously written Bartle, Bartles', Bartell and Bartells', but I have the 
 evidence of a neighbor of the introducer, who is now dead, that he speUed his name Bartel. Perhaps the 
 orthography of the name may have been confused because of another family in Clinton County which 
 spells its name Bartels.
