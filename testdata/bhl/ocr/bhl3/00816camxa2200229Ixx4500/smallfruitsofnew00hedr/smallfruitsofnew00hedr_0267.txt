THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 1 97 

bushels to an acre. They do not blossom until late in the spring — later 
 than the strawberry — the fruit maturing in from four to six weeks after 
 blossoming — hence they are seldom if ever injured by late frosts in the 
 spring. They are very hardy — having succeeded as far north as Wis- 
 consin and the northern part of Iowa.' An account of methods of culti- 
 vation is then given. ' I shipped some of my dewberries to New York 
 city from this place for which I received sixteen dollars per bushel. I also 
 shipped to Rockford, 111., St. Louis, Mo., and to Independence, Iowa, 
 for which I received twelve dollars and eighty cents per bushel; while the 
 highest price paid for straw-berries did not exceed, on an average, six dollars 
 and forty cents per bushel. I consider the dewberry the most profitable 
 fruit raised.' Mr. Purdy gave roots of this dewberry as a premium to his 
 paper at this time, and among those who obtained it were I. N. Stone, of 
 Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, and Hon. B. F. Adams, of Madison, Wisconsin, 
 the only persons, probably, as Mr. Stone writes me, ' who had stifficient 
 confidence in it to give it a fair trial.' Mr. Stone has made a marked success 
 of its culture, and all the plants set in recent years appear to have come 
 directly or indirectly from him." 

The Bartel, while probably the first dewberry to receive a name, was 
 not the first one to be grown commonly and largely by fruit growers. That 
 honor belongs to Lucretia, long the standard commercial sort and still a 
 favorite. We must again go to Bailey^ for the first fuU historical account 
 of this berry. He says : — 

" The story of its discovery and introduction is told me by B. F. Albaugh, 
 of Covington, Miami Co., Ohio, who introduced it to the trade. A young 
 man named Williams enlisted in the civil war from Miami Co., Ohio. 
 During most of his service he was stationed in West Virginia, part of the 
 time near Beverly. While guarding private property there he became 
 acquainted with the woman who afterwards became his wife. He settled 
 on her plantation after the war, and upon it found the dewberries growing 
 wild. He transplanted some to his garden, and these attracted the atten- 
 tion of his father who visited him in 1875. The following year plants were 
 sent to the father in Ohio and they were distributed among a few friends. 
 The plants were carelessly dug, however, and only five of the genuine 
 variety happened to be in the lot and these, along with many worthless 
 ones, chanced to fall into the hands of Mr. Albaugh. From these five 
 plants the present stock has sprung. When the variety was offered for 
 sale Mr. Albaugh named it Lucretia, for Mrs. Lucretia Garfield. Mr. 
 Albaugh tells me that the five original plants are still vigorous and fruitful. 
 A portion of one of the original plants — about one-ninth of it — was 
 exhibited at the Association of American Nurserymen at Washington in 

' Cornell Sta. Bui. 34:287. 1891.
