198 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

June, 1886. This specimen bore 978 berries. E. Y. Teas, now of Irvington, 
 Indiana, appears to have been the first to figure and offer for sale the 
 Lucretia." 

From time to time other dewberries appeared of greater or less value, 
 but the dewberry remained until the beginning of the present century a 
 suspicious inhabitant of the fruit plantation. Its vicious thorns and 
 unmanageable canes condemned it, and, as with all new fruits, the pre- 
 sumption was against an unfamiliar plant in cultivated grounds, especially 
 when its near of kin have been troublesome intruders from fence rows and 
 forests. And so, although several interesting forms of the common or 
 northern dewberry appeared before 1900, it was not until this date or after 
 that dewberry culture began to take form as one of the small fruit industries 
 of the country. Several quite distinct types now came under ciiltivation, 
 some of which must be mentioned, but the reader must turn to Chapter II 
 on the botany of this fruit for a full list of the species of dewberries now 
 under cultivation. 

The dewberries so far discussed belong to the northern states, or more 
 accvirately the northeastern states and may be roughly lumped into the 
 northern dewberries. About 25 varieties belong here. Perhaps as many 
 more sorts, mostly of comparatively recent introduction, belong to the 
 southern dewberries, and nearly as many more to the western dewberries. 
 The botany of the three groups is little understood. Several species are 
 involved, accounts of which have been given in previous pages. It must 
 suffice here to give a brief sketch of the introduction of a few of the earliest 
 and most prominent varieties from these widely separated parts of North 
 America. 

SOUTHERN DEWBERRIES 

The southern dewberries are for the most part evergreen or nearly so 
 and rather more prostrate than the northern varieties. Bailey names the 
 following dewberries as coming from southern species:' Bauer, Drishill, 
 Eight EUs, Extra, Houston, Howard, Lime Kiln, Long Branch, Lost Ball, 
 McDonald, Manatee, Muchee Grandee, Race Track, Rockledge, Rogers, 
 White (from Louisiana) and Wilson's (from Texas). Of these seventeen 
 southern sorts, only Manatee, McDonald, and Rogers have been tried on 
 the grounds of this Station. No one of the three have been sufficiently 
 hardy, vigorous, or productive to merit recommendation for any purpose 
 in the North. As wiU be seen from the histories in the chapter on varieties,
