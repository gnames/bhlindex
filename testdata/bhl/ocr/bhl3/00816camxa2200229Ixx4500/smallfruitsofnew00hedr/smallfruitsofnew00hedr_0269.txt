THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 1 99 

of all of which an account can be found, most of these southern sorts have 
 been brought in from the wild or are chance seedlings, and none have 
 achieved pomological prominence. It is doubtful if more than three or 
 four of the above list could now be obtained so short have been their popu- 
 larity. Nevertheless some are promising and as their breeding progresses, 
 southern dewberries may be expected to play an important part in 
 the pomology of the South. 

WESTERN DEWBERRIES 

Two types of dewberries have come from the Pacific slope. One type 
 is best represented by the loganberry and the other by Mammoth. The 
 introduction of the loganberry is a landmark in the history of small fruits. 
 Its discovery, introduction, rise to a popular and standard product, and 
 adaptation to several commercial uses, are about the most engaging events 
 in modem pomology. An enigmatical origin adds interest to this remarkable 
 fruit. Its value to pomology is much greater than the intrinsic worth of 
 the variety, for it has inspired breeders of small fruits to produce something 
 similar or better to the end that a dozen or more valuable small fruits 
 have appeared as emulations of the loganberry and one sees in the futiire 
 a great array of loganberry-like varieties. 

What is the loganberry? It originated in California, as we shall see, 
 from the seed of what the Califomians call the wild blackberry. Called 
 after its originator, it became the Logan blackberry, a name favored by 
 workers in the United States Department of Agriculture and in many 
 experiment stations. But the parent plant was a dewberry as pomologists 
 and botanists usually use the word, and " blackberry " is a confusing mis- 
 nomer. For some years after its introduction, the loganberry was supposed 
 to be a hybrid between the red raspberry and the dewberry of California, 
 and the name " blaspberry," a word made by substituting the first two 
 letters of "blackberry" for the first letter of "raspberry" was proposed. 
 This name, an imfortimate suggestion, met with small favor and is now 
 seldom heard. Meanwhile, by common consent, "loganberry" as a group 
 rather than a varietal name, has come into general use. So much for the 
 name, now greater detail as to the origin of the loganberry must be 
 given. 

Fortimately there are several accounts of the origin of the logan- 
 berry from its originator, Judge J. H. Logan, Santa Cruz, California.
