THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 20I 

botanist at this Station, who has done the botanical work for this text, after 
 a painstaking study of herbarium specimens of this and related varieties 
 and species, believes loganberry to be a red sport from the black dewberry, 
 Rjibiis ursinus. 

The loganberry has been used at this Station in hybridization but the 
 resvilts, as yet, contribute little to show whether this fruit is a hybrid or a 
 pure-bred dewberry. The only phenomenon noted on these grounds is, 
 possibly, collateral evidence toward the theory of hybridity. The red 
 raspberry has been hybridized with several species of Rubus. In most of 
 these hybrids the raspberry seems completely submerged. Hybrids between 
 it and the loganberry, Mahdi, the wineberry, and the large-leaved flowering 
 raspberry of the East, show almost no trace of the red raspberry in the 
 first generation; subsequent generations prove hybridity. One might 
 reasonably suspect, therefore, that the loganberry may be a red raspberry 
 hybrid even though the raspberry shows but little in plant or fruit of the 
 loganberry. Nevertheless, with the evidence from all sources at hand, it 
 seems most probable that the loganberry is a red-fruited sport from the 
 western dewberry. 

The loganberry is now commonly found in home and market gardens 
 of all the Pacific States, whence large shipments are made of fresh fruit to 
 the East. The berries are evaporated and make a valuable dried fruit; 
 large quantities are canned; it is a splendid fruit for jams and preserves; 
 and a large part of the crop is now used for a non-alcoholic drink. Propa- 
 gation, culture, pruning, training, and harvesting are not more difficult than 
 with other bramble fruits and the yields are high. 

Western dewberries are represented by a score or more noteworthy 
 varieties other than the loganberry, of which some of the most promising 
 are related to this most important variety. Of the loganberry-like sorts, 
 Laxton, Mahdi, Mammoth, Phenomenal, and Primus are best known. 
 Aughinbaugh, Belle of Washington, Skagit Chief, Washington Climbing, 
 Cory Thomless, and Gardena, are other derivatives from western species 
 of dewberries. 

MAGNITUDE OF THE BLACKBERRY AND DEWBERRY INDUSTRY 

Figures showing the magnitude of an industry are always interesting, 
 and in studies of marketing and of fruit regions are often valuable. Table 
 2 from the Fourteenth Census, taken in 1919, shows the magnitude of the 
 blackberry and dewberry industry in the United States at the date of the
