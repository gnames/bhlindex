Long a favorite early blackberry, Agawam is still widely grown but is now no longer 
 rated as a standard commercial sort. Its most notable good qualities are productiveness 
 of plant, high quality and earliness of fruit. The berries, while not of largest size, are 
 large, very attractive in appearance, ship and keep well. The plants suffer somewhat from 
 winter killing, but still are as hardy as the average blackberry. They resist drouth well, 
 have comparatively few and small thorns, and produce their fruit over a long season. 
 Unfortunately the berries are too variable in size and color, and require so many pickings 
 that the variety is not now set in a commercial plantation. The plants have peculiarities 
 of continuing to bloom after the first fruits are ripe and of having the leaves heavily tinged 
 with red late in the season. Agawam was found growing in a pasture between 1865 and 
 1870 by John Perkins, Ipswich, Massachusetts. In 1889 the American Pomological Society 
 added the variety to its fruit catalog list. 

Plants above medium in size and vigor, upright-spreading, fairly hardy, very produc- 
 tive, healthy; canes numerous, stocky, angular, glossy green changing to dark reddish 
 brown, slightly pubescent; prickles comparatively small, medium in thickness, strength 
 and number, greenish; leaflets 3-5, roundish oval, light green, heavily tinged red late in 
 the fall, dull, rugose, pubescent, with serrate margins; petiole medium in length and thick- 
 ness, with few prickles. Flowers very early, blooming period long; petals white, oblong; 
 clusters short, medium in compactness, leafy; pedicels long, slender, glandular; calyx 
 slightly tomentose. Fruit early, season very long, ships well ; medium in size, broad-oblong, 
 glossy, attractive black; drupelets large, rounded, with strong coherence; core soft; flesh 
 rather soft, sweet and pleasant; quality very good.
