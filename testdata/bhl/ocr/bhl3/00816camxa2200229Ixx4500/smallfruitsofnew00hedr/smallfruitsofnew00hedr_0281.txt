THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 207 

A seedling of Oregon Evergreen which originated in 1896, with George H. Liepe, 
 Cologne, New Jersey, by whom it was introduced in 1909. It is so similar to Oregon Ever- 
 green that a separate description is not necessary.

Perhaps there is greater diversity of opinion in regard to the merit of Blowers than of 
 any other blackberry. It is championed by some, condemned by most, differences in 
 opinion arising for the reason that the plants are exceedingly capricious and vary greatly 
 as grown in different seasons, soils and climates. Where grown best, however, many of 
 the berries are imperfect and worthless as a commercial product. Despite these defects 
 recognized by experimenters and fruit growers generally, nurserymen continue to offer it 
 as a valuable variety. It is of the type of Snyder, but not nearly as reliable as that 
 standard sort. Blowers originated with H. W. Blowers, Westfield, New York, about 1888. 
 The American Pomological Society added the variety to its fruit catalog in 1909.
