 ness, productive; canes stout; prickles numerous, moderately strong; fruit medium in size, 
 short oblong; drupelets large, glossy black, sweet; very good; core soft; season esxly and

In the early stages of blackberry culture in this cotmtrj', Early Harvest was considered 
 valuable as an extra early variety. It is now little grown as the plants suffer much from 
 winter injury in the North and in the South are very susceptible to orange- rust . The variety 
 is prized in parts of California and is an extra early sort in some parts of the South. The 
 fruits are small with small drupelets but are very uniform in size, jet black, and are very 
 distinct from that of other sorts in general appearance. They ship well and the quality 
 is very good. The plants are so stockj% upright, and sturdy as to require no trellis, 
 making the variety a desirable one for the home garden. This is an old variety, the original 
 plant of which was found growing wild in Illinois some time previous to 1880. The Ameri- 
 can Pomological Society added the variety to its recommended list of fruits in 1883. 

Plants dwarfish, branching freely, medium in height and vigor, very upright, requiring 
 no trellis, tender to cold, variable in yield, susceptible to orange- rust in some localities; 
 canes variable in number, deeply furrowed, green changing to dark reddish brown or red 
 at maturity, dull, glabrous; prickles small, slender, medium to few; leaflets 3-5, oval-lanceo- 
 late, small, rather thin, light green assuming a reddish cast and persistent late in the fall, 
 dvdl, with deeply serrate margins; petiole long, medivmi in thickness, prickly, pubescent. 
 Flowers midseason, self-fertile, in short, leafy clusters; pedicels heavily pubescent. Fruit
