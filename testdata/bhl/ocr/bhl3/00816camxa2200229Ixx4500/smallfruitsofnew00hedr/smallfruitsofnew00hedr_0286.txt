212 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

very early, ships well; distinctive in appearance, medium in size, conical, slightly elongated, 
 glossy jet black; drupelets small, uniform, round, with fairly good coherence; core soft; 
 flesh juicy, tender, very mild, sweet; quality fair to sometimes good. 

Early King. i. Rural N. Y. 48:606, fig. 2^0. 1889. 2. TV. F. 5ta. 5m/. 278:142. 1906. 

King. 3. U. S. D. A. Farmers' Bui. 643:12. 1915. 

Originated in Missouri prior to 1885; brought to attention about 1889. It did not 
 prove hardy or productive at this Station, but in the milder parts of the East is a good early 
 sort. King was added to the American Pomological Society's fruit list in 1909. Plants 
 vigorous, dwarfish, subject to winter injury, moderately productive, subject to rust; canes 
 purplish, with niunerous long prickles; fruit of medium size, roundish or slightly oblong, 
 attractive black, firm, sweet; good; season early, short. 

Early Mammoth, i. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 63:666. 1893. 

Thompson's Early Mammoth. 2. Atn. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 84. 1891. 

Sent out about 1888 by the Cleveland Nursery Company, Lakewood, Ohio. It was 
 said to be a hybrid between the blackberry and the dewberry, but at this Station it was 
 very similar to Wilson, Jr., in habit of growth. Plants moderately vigorous, not kardy, 
 productive; canes tinged red, covered with numerous slender prickles; fruit variable in 
 size from small to very large, slightly elongated; drupelets large, many poorly developed, 
 bright black, very juicy, subacid; good. 

Early Wonder, i. Fitzgerald Nur. Cat. 1915. 

Found about 1902 by the Fitzgerald Nurseries, Stephenville, Texas, by whom it was 
 introduced about 1910. Plants more productive than Dallas; foliage scanty; fruits as 
 large as those of Mayes, ripening after McDonald, sometimes autumn-fruiting. 

Eldorado, i. U. S. D. A. Pom. Rpt. 394. 1891. 2. A'. Y. Sta. Bui. 278:136. 1906. 
 3. Card Bush-Fr. 218. 1917. 

This sort has several notable virtues which made it for many years a standard black- 
 berry. It is still much prized for home and local markets in most of the blackberry regions 
 of eastern America. The qualities which commend it are great hardiness and great 
 immunity from the orange-rust which seldom attacks it. The fruits are large, handsome 
 in appearance, and exceptionally high in quality. Eldorado is usually considered the first 
 main crop variety to ripen. This variety originated about 1880 as a chance seedling near 
 the village of Eldorado, Ohio. In 1899 the variety was added to the fruit list of the Ameri- 
 can Pomological Society. 

Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, productive, healthy, seldom attacked 
 by orange-rust ; canes obtusely furrowed, glossy, greenish red becoming dark red at maturity, 
 glabrous, with small, almost sessile glands; prickles long, slender, numerous, reddish at 
 the base; leaflets usually 5, oval, dull, somewhat smooth, pubescent, with serrate margins; 
 petiole reddish, slender, nearly glabrous, with few small glands. Flowers self-fertile, 
 early, in loose, leafy clusters; petals white, oblong; pedicels long, slender, glandular. Fruit 
 early midseason, ripening period long; large, roundish to slightly elongated, jet black; 
 drupelets large, round, few; core soft; flesh juicy, firm, sweet, rich, pleasantly flavored; 
 quality good to very good.
