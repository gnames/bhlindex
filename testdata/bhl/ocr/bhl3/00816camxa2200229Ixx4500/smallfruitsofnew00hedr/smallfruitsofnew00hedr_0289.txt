On the grounds of this Station, Erie has long been one of the best varieties, notable 
 as jnelding a good crop of extremely large, handsome, well-flavored berries. It has always 
 seemed to the experimenters here that Erie is worthy of more general cultivation. The 
 plants are very vigorous, usually productive, and nearly immune to the dreaded blackberry 
 rust. It is not as hardy as might be wished but is above the average in this respect. While 
 the fruits are large and handsome, they are not high in quality, usually, however, because 
 the fruit is picked before it has matured. The berries of Erie remain hard and sour long 
 after turning black, and if the picking is hurried, they are wretchedly poor in quality. 
 Erie originated with L. B. Pierce, Tallmadge, Ohio, in 1876, probably as a seedling of 
 Lawton. It was introduced by J. T. Lovett in 1886 mider the name Uncle Tom, which 
 name was later changed to Erie. The American Pomological Society added Erie to its 
 fruit catalog list in 1889. 

Plants medium to tall, vigorous, often much branched, upright-spreading, fairly hardy, 
 productive, healthy, seldom attacked by orange-rust ; canes numerous, very stocky, deeply 
 furrowed, obtuse-angled, glossy, greenish changing to dull red, pubescent, glandular; 
 prickles large, long, numerous, greenish; leaflets 5, large, thick, oval, light green changing 
 to dull red late in the fall, dull, rugose, pubescent, with serrate margins, petiole thick. 
 Flowers midseason, very large, borne in long, open, leafy clusters ; pedicels thick, glandular. 
 Fruit midseason; large to very large, broadly cylindrical to nearly globular, tapering 
 irregularly, glossy, attractive black; drupelets numerous, rather small, round; core rather 
 soft; flesh soft only when fully mature, juicy, sweet when fully ripe, pleasantly flavored; 
 quality good. 

Erskine Park, i, Harris Nur. Cat. 62. 191 1. 

Originated about 1904 with E. J. Norman, Lenox, Massachusetts; supposed to be a 
 sport of Kittatinny. One year's test at this Station shows that the variety has con- 
 siderable merit. Plants tall, vigorous, upright, branching freely, hardy and productive; 
 canes stocky, diill green with reddish brown tinge, glabrous; prickles medium in number, 
 strong; fruit medium in size, irregular, roimdish conic to cylindrical; drupelets of medium 
 size, cohering strongly, glossy black, jtiicy, tender, sweet; very good; core soft; season long. 

Eureka, i. Mich. Hart. Soc. Rpt. 406. 1886. 

Raised from seed of Wilson by William Parry, Parry, New Jersey, in 1876. After 
 growing many seedlings for four years, the best was selected and named Eureka. 

Eureka (of Texas), i. Mtmson Ca^. 10. 1899. 2. Rural N. Y. 61:578. 1902. 

Brought from Alabama to Texas by H. A. Biles, Roanoke, Texas; introduced in 1899 
 by T. V. Munson & Son, Denison, Texas. As grown at the trial grounds of the Rural New- 
 Yorker, the plants were tender, unproductive and thorny; the fruit large, round, jet black, 

firm, sweet, with a pleasing flavor.
