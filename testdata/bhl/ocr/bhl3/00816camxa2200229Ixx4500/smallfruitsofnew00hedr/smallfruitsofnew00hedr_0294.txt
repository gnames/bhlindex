A full account of this berry is given elsewhere. (See page 191.) The variety is all but 
 worthless in New York and the eastern states but is rather commonly grown for home 
 markets on the Pacific Slope. The plants are too tender to cold for northern regions 
 and in regions south of Pennsylvania, while they withstand the weather and seem vigorous, 
 they are almost barren. Wherever grown the plants need cross pollination, and even so 
 produce many imperfect fruits. The berries are not high in quality and are rather imin- 
 viting in appearance. The long, trailing, thorny evergreen canes are almost unmanageable 
 on trellis or stakes. On the Pacific Coast, however, the plant is grown on arbors and 
 trellises, and blooms and bears fruit all summer and autumn. There may be value in the 
 variety for hybridization as the several hybrids now known, of which it is one parent, 
 promise much. Vigor and productiveness of plants are characters for which it should be 
 used in hybridization. The American Pomological Society added the sort to its fruit 
 catalog list in 1909. 

Plants extremely vigorous, trailing, tender to cold, variable in yield, susceptible to 
 anthracnose; propagated from tips or root-cuttings; canes perennial, numerous, very stocky, 
 greenish, tinged red, glossy, pubescent, cylindrical or furrowed; prickles long, thick, very 
 strong, numerous, reddish at the base but green tipped; leaflets 3-5, oblong-oval to obovate. 
 dull, luxuriant dark green, smooth, thick, slightly pubescent, with serrate margins; petiole 
 thick, greenish red. Flowers late, said to require cross pollination, large, showy, few, 
 pinkish, in rather short, open, leafy, prickly clusters; pedicels somewhat short, prickly. 
 Fruit very late, season very long; extremely variable in shape and size, averaging medium, 
 irregularly hemispherical, glossy black; drupelets intermediate in size, round, with fairiy 
 good coherence; core soft, with creamy red tinge; flesh juicy, tender, very tart becoming 
 sprightly when fully ripe; quality fair to good. 

Hoag. I. Col. 0. Hart. Soc. Rpt. 7c. 1887. 

Originated with Charles R. Hoag, Kasson, Minnesota, and named after him by the 
 Minnesota Horticultural Society. Sent out for trial in 1887 by A. W. Sias, a vice-president 
 of that organization. Plants productive with the originator, but a failure elsewhere. 

Holcomb. I. Mag. Hort. 25:397. 1859. 

Exhibited before the Hartford, Connecticut, Horticultural Society in 1855 by E. A. 
 Holcomb, Granby, Connecticut. Plants vigorous, productive, and hardy; canes moder- 
 ately stout; fruit large, roimdish oval, black, moderately firm, sweet, rich, excellent; 
 early. 

Holt. I. Col. 0. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 9. 1890. 

Originated prior to 1890 with Samuel Holt, Worthington, Ohio. Described as promis- 
 ing because of vigor and productivity of plants and size and quality of fruit.
