McDonald is a blackberry-dewberry hybrid with rather remarkable qualities of 
 both plants and fruits. The plants are very vigorous, remarkably productive, wholly 
 immtme to rust, better able to withstand drought than almost any other bramble, and 
 ripen their crop two weeks before the blackberry season, the first of its kind to bloom and 
 ripen fruit. The canes trail the first season, dewberry-like, but in succeeding seasons send 
 up strong drooping canes partaking more of the blackberry parent. The berries are of 
 largest size, borne in prodigous quantities, jet black and very handsome, among the best 
 in quality, and hang in good condition on the plants for several days after ripening. The 
 variety has one serious fault ; it is self -sterile and must be interplanted with another black- 
 berry or dewberry for a pollinizer. McDonald is not proving of very great value in New 
 York and the East, but is much grown in Texas, Oklahoma, and Missouri. This blackberry- 
 dewberry hybrid, probably of Texas origin, has been grown in several southwestern states 
 for the past quarter century. In 1909 the American Pomological Society added McDonald 
 to its recommended list of fruits. 

Plants vigorous, spreading and drooping, tender to cold, variable in yield, healthy; 
 canes long, variable in thickness, numerous; leaflets 5, rather small, long-oval, thin, dark 
 green, glossy, with shallowly serrate margins. Flowers early, self-sterile, few, white, in 
 long, open, leafy, slightly prickly clusters; pedicels long, medium in thickness, heavily 
 pubescent, seldom prickly. Fruit very early; large, oblong-conic, jet black; drupelets
