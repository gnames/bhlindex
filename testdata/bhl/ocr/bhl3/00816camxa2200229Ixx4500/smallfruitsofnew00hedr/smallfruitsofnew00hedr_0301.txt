This is another blackberry-dewberry, which, since it partakes most of the blackberry 
 parent, is usually listed with blackberries. The variety is grown very little in New York 
 and the East because quite too tender to cold, but it is a standard bramble fruit in Cali- 
 fornia, esteemed both for its healthy, \'igorous, productive plants and for its enormous, 
 handsome, richly flavored fruits. Well grown, the fruits are said to be larger than those 
 of any other of the cultivated brambles. The plants of Mammoth are remarkable in that 
 the canes grow upright several feet and then begin to trail, sometimes attaining a length 
 of 25 or 30 feet. The canes are stout and covered with small, short spines. The plants 
 are propagated from tips and usually fail to come from root cuttings, the method of prop- 
 agating blackberries. The leaves are semi-evergreen in California. The blossoms are 
 self-sterile and the loganberry is usually set for cross pollination. Two other varieties 
 very similar to Mammoth are offered by nurserymen under the names Tribble and Cory 
 Thomless. Calif omians say that they are distinct, however. The canes of the Cory 
 Thomless are said to be thomless or nearly so. Mammoth was originated by Judge 
 J. H. Logan, Santa Cruz, California, and is supposed to be a cross between the Texas 
 blackberry and the western dewberry. The name was added to the list of fruits 
 recommended for culture by the American Pomological Society in 1909. The variety has 
 often been confused with Bartel which has also been called Mammoth. 

Plants very vigorous, semi-trailing, tender to cold, unproductive in the East, but very 
 productive on the Pacific Slope, healthy; propagated from tips; reported that it cannot be
