THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 225 

in vigor and productiveness, sucker sparingly, are susceptible to the orange-rust, are tender 
 to cold, and bear flowers that must be cross pollinated. Despite this long list of faults, the 
 variety is well liked in mild climates. The plants propagate by rooting at the tips. Rath- 
 bun originated about 1885 with Alvin Rathbun, Silver Creek, New York. It is a chance 
 seedling which sprang up near a planting of Early Harvest and Kittatinny. Its habit of 
 growth, however, indicates that it may be a blackberry-dewberry hybrid. Rathbim was 
 introduced by James Vick's Sons, Rochester, New York. In 1909 the American Pomo- 
 logical Society added the variety to its list of recommended fruits.
