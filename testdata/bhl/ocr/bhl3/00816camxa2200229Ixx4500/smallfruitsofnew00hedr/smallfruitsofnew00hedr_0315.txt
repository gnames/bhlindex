THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 229 

greenish yellow canes, usually tinted with red. The thorns are large and numerous, making 
 picking more unpleasant than with most other varieties of this fruit. The long, thimble- 
 iike berries are borne in large clusters. Taylor may still be planted to close the blackberry 
 season in New York, but is becoming less and less popular even for this purpose. This is 
 an old variety of imknown parentage, introduced by a Mr. Taylor, of Spiceland, Indiana, 
 about 1867. In 1S81 Taylor was added to the recommended fruit Hst of the American 
 Pomological Society. 

Plants upright-spreading, very hardy, variable in yield, variable in resistance to orange- 
 rust; canes numerous, angular or nearly cylindrical, pale green mingled with red, becoming 
 light brown with trace of yellow at maturity, lightly pubescent, glandular; prickles small 
 to large, short, slender, numerous, green or tipped with dull brown; leaflets 3-5, oblong- 
 lanceolate, thick, very lightly rugose, pubescent, with even and finely serrate margins; 
 petiole long, glandular. Flowers early, 5-9, in long, loose, leafless, prickly clusters; 
 pedicels long, thickly pubescent, prickly; calyx with few glands. Fruit late, borne in 
 immense clusters, medium or below in size, elongated-conic, glossy black; drupelets rather 
 small, uniform, with strong coherence; core soft, white; flesh rather soft, juicy, sweet, 
 rich, pleasantly flavored; quality very good to best.

Macatawa. 5. Berrydale Card. Cat. 15. 19 13. 

Introduced into California from Texas prior to 1885 by Dr. J. R. Crandall, Auburn, 
 California, after whom the variety was renamed. The original name, Texas Early, is 
 retained here, although Crandall is more generally used. Macatawa,. introduced in 1913, 
 proved to be identical with Texas Early at this Station. In southern California this sort 
 is popular for its earliness, long-ripening period, and high quality. As grown at this Station 
 the plants require winter protection, and the fruit is inferior to that of standard black- 
 berries. It was placed in the catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1901 as Cran- 
 dall, remaining in the last catalog in 1909. Plants vigorous, semi-trailing, not liardy, 
 productive, with few suckers; fruit large, firm, sweet; very good; very early. 

Texas Evergreen, i. Lovett Cat. No. 3, 5. 1915. 

Introduced in 1915 by J. T. Lovett, Little Silver, New Jersey, with the statement that 
 it had been brought from South Africa by a Mr. Texas. As grown at this Station the plants 
 are tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, moderately productive; canes very stocky with 
 numerous thick, strong prickles; fruit of medium size, irregularly cylindrical, conic to short- 
 conic; drupelets medium in niunber, large, glossy black, juicy, melting, subacid; good; 
 core hard; late.
