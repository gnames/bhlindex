 Hedrick Cyc. Hardy Fr. 290. 1922. 
 A chance seedling found about 1900 by Thomas H. Ward, Manalapan, New Jersey ; sup-

 Jersey as a late variety but at this Station it is not fully hardy. Ward appeared in the last 
 catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1909. Plants tall, vigorous, upright- 
 spreading, half-hardy, moderately productive; canes stocky, green tinged reddish brown, 
 nearly glabrous; prickles medium in number, large, strong; fruit of medium size, irregular
