Discovered about 1854 by John Wilson, Burlington, New Jersey. For a number of 
 years this was a popular variety, especially valuable in New Jersey, where large fruits, 
 earliness and productivity made it the leading sort. As grown at this Station the plants 
 lack hardiness, must be covered to produce satisfactory crops, and many imperfect 
 flowers, chiefly double, are borne. It is possible that this variety contained a mixture soon 
 after its introduction as two types of plants are mentioned in early descriptions, one being 
 erect and branching, the other slender and trailing, the latter form sometimes rooting at 
 the tips. The American Pomological Society placed this variety in its catalog in 1867; 
 it remained in the last catalog in 1909. Plants dwarfish, upright, moderately vigorous, 
 half-hardy, productive where hardy; canes stocky, roundish, pubescent with numerous 
 small prickles; flowers inclined to doubling; fruit large, oblong to oval, slightly pointed; 
 drupelets large, many failing to develop as grown here, glossy black, firm, juicy, sweet; 
 good; early. 

Wilson, Jr. i. Card. Man. 27:208. 1885. 2. A^ Y. Sta. Bui. 63:669. 1893. 

Raised by William Parry, Parry, New Jersey, in 1875, from seed of Wilson. The 
 variety is very similar to its parent and like that sort requires winter protection in this 
 latitude. Wilson, Jr., was placed in the catalog of the American Pomological Society in 
 1885 and removed in 1899. Plants intermediate in habit between dewberries and black- 
 berries, dwarfish, moderately vigorous, tender to cold, moderately productive; canes tinged 
 reddish; fruit variable in size, medium to very large, roundish to slightly elongated; drupe- 
 lets large, sometimes imperfectly developed, very juicy, acid; good to very good; core hard; 
 early. 

Woodford, i. Mass. Sta. Bui. 44:17. 1897. 

On trial at the Massachusetts Station in 1896. Plants not vigorous, hardy, vmpro- 
 ductive; fruit large, attractive; good. 

Woodland, i. A^. V. S/a. 5m/. 81:582. 1894. 

Received at this Station in 1892 from W. H. Phillips, Staunton, Indiana. Plants 
 vigorous, tender to cold, productive; fruit medium in size, roimdish; drupelets large, 
 with pleasant flavor; good.
