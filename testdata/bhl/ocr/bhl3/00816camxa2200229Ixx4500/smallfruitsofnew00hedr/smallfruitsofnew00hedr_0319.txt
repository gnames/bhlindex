Aughinbaugh is little grown in New York and the East, but before the advent of the 
 loganberry was much grown in California and the Pacific slope. It is now rapidly passing 
 into obli^aon, but is notable as one of the first cultivated representatives of the western 
 dewberry. The plants are seldom satisfactory as to vigor and productiveness. This 
 variety, the culture of which is confined to California, was propagated and sold by a Mr. 
 Aughinbaugh about 1S75. Aughinbaugh fotind the variety growing wild on the peninsula 
 of Alameda. It achieved some popularitj^ but, being pistillate, required pollen from 
 another sort to set fruit, and for this reason became unpopular, and has now been nearly 
 lost from sight. 

Plants inferior in vigor, drooping or trailing, tender to cold in the East, variable in 
 yield, healthy; canes slender, pubescent; prickles slender; leaflets evergreen, 3-5, small 
 to medium, ovate, dark green, with serrate margins. Flowers pistillate, requiring pollen 
 from another variety to set fruit. Fruit early; medium in size, somewhat oblong, black; 
 drupelets more or less pubescent, numerous, small; flesh juicy, tender, sweet, pleasantly 
 flavored; quality good. 

Aus-Lu. I. Townsend Cat. 27. 1923. 

Introduced in 1923 by E. W. Townsend & Sons, Salisbury, Maryland. Said to be a 
 cross between Mayes and Lucretia. Plants as productive as those of Mayes; fruit large, 
 mild, sweet; early. 

Austin Thomless. i. Parker & Son Cat. 12. 1924. 

Originated about 1918 with J. Parker, Tecumseh, Oklahoma. Introduced in 1924 
 by J. M. Parker & Son Nurserj' Company, Fayetteville, Arkansas. Said to be a seedling of 
 Mayes and similar to that variety, but thomless.

Bartel's Mammoth. 5. Bailey Ev. Nat. Fruits 348. 1898. 

Bartel is notable as the first dewberry to find favor with American pomologists. In the 
 early days of its culture the variety was known for its exceedingly large, handsome berries, 
 characters which had much to do with the popularity of Bartel and dewberries in general. 
 Bartel was introduced early in the seventies by a Dr. Bartel, Huey, Illinois. The variety 
 was first called Bartel's Mammoth with various spellings of the word Bartel. Although 
 once considerably grown, due primarily to extensive advertising, Bartel is now rarely 
 found in commercial plantings, better dewberries having taken its place. (For fuller 
 details of history see page 196.) Plants very vigorous, trailing, tender to cold; fruit large 
 to very large; flesh firm, sour and poor in flavor; quality poor.
