Nearly worthless in New York and in the East, Gardena is valuable in southern Cali- 
 fornia. The plants are described as healthy, very productive, and as ripening their crop 
 early and during a short period. The berries are large, firm of flesh, rich and sweet in 
 flavor, and of high quality. The crop ripens about ten days before that of the well-known 
 Lucretia. This variety is of western origin, named from Gardena, California. It is sup- 
 posed to be a seedling of Premo. 

Plants vigorous, healthy, trailing, hardy in the West but tender to cold in the East, 
 variable in yield; canes slender, cylindrical, greenish, glabrous, without bloom, eglandular; 
 thorns small, numerous, greenish. Fruit early; large, glossy black; flesh juicy, firm, rich, 
 sweet, pleasantly flavored; quality good.
