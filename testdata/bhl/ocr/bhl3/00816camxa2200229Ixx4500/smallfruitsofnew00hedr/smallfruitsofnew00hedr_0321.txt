THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 235 

Geer. i. Cornell Sia. Bid. 34: 28^. 1891. 

Discovered in a woodlot on the property of a Mrs. Geer, Plainfield, Michigan, by 
 F. L. Wright of that place, who transferred plants to his garden in 1887. Plants fairly 
 productive; fruit small. 

General Grant, i. Cornell Sta. Bui. 34:308. 1891. 

Introduced about 1886 by Charles A. Green, Rochester, New York, as a premium for 
 subscription to his Fruit Grower. The variety had little merit and never became prominent. 

Golden Queen, i. Card Bush-Fr. 220. 191 7. 

According to Card this variety was mentioned in the Horticultural Gleaner for 1898 
 " as a new dewberry of golden yellow color, large and productive." 

Guadeloupe, i. Card Bush-Fr. 220. 191 7. 2. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 160. 1920. 

Found in the wild by Otto Locke, New Bratmfels, Texas. Introduced by the Comal 
 Springs Nursery of that place. Plants vigorous and productive; fruit large, oblong, of 
 darkest color, sweet; early. 

Haupt. I. Austin Nur. Cat. 23. 1909. 

Found in the wild in Wharton County, Texas, by Col. W. W. Haupt, Kyle, Texas, 
 about 1898, and introduced a few years later by the Austin Nursery Company, Austin, 
 Texas. Thought to be a cross between a dewberry' and a blackberry. The introducers 
 state that, as it will not pollinate itself, two or three strains are mi.xed in each order to pro- 
 vide for cross pollination. The variety is of no value at this Station as it kills to the ground 
 every winter. Haupt was placed in the catalog of the American Pomological Society in 
 1909. Plants vigorous, trailing, with small, dark green foliage. 

Humboldt, i. Rural N. Y. 55:547. 1896. 2. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 159. 1920. 

Originated by S. L. Watkins, Pleasant Valley, California, who introduced it in 1916; 
 said to be a seedling of Rubus ursimis. Plants trailing, very vigorous and productive, 
 canes sometimes reaching a length of twenty feet; fruit very large, thick, attractive jet 
 black with a spicy wild flavor; early. 

Humbolt. I. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 286. 192 1. 

Originated by Luther Burbank, Santa Rosa, California. Supposed to be a cross 
 between an improved California dewberry and Cuthbert. Plants very vigorous; fruit very 
 large, dark crimson, covered with a silvery sheen, very acid with both raspberry and black- 
 berry flavor, excellent for canning; ripens in June in California. 

Laxtonberry. i. Garden 80:228. 1916. 2. Bunyard Cat. 18. 1921. 3. Hedrick Cyc. 
 Hardy Fr. 290. 1922. 

Laxton. 3. U. S. D. A. Farmers' Bui. ggS: 22- 1918. 

As its history shows, Laxtonberry originated in England where it has attained some 
 prominence as a cultivated fnait. It is little grown in eastern North America, but finds 
 some favor on the Pacific Slope. This interesting hybrid, having much the habit of growth 
 of the loganberry, is listed with dewberries, for, as usually seems to be the case in the hybrids 
 in which the red raspberry is one parent, the raspberry characters are almost wholly 
 submerged. The berry is much like that of the loganberry in color and flavor, but separates
