236 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

from the receptacle somewhat like a raspberry. The blossoms are not wholly self-fertile 
 and the variety must be planted in proximity to the loganberry or a red raspberry, pref- 
 erably the former. Laxtonberry is a cross between the loganberry and the Superlative red 
 raspberry, and was originated by Laxton Brothers of England. The berry is much like the 
 loganberry in color and flavor, but separates from the receptacle somewhat like a raspberry. 
 Canes roundish, glabrous, eglandular; thorns weak, straight, small, numerous, yellow- 
 ish brown; leaflets 3-5, broad, medium in size, dull green, with white tomentose beneath, 
 the margins crenate in single and double series; lower and lateral leaves sessile; petiole 
 medium in length, thick, pubescent, prickly. Flowers not wholly self-fertile, in compact, 
 leafy clusters medium in length.

Plants and fruits of the loganberry are discussed in two previous chapters to which 
 readers seeking full information on this interesting fruit should turn. (See pages 59 
 and 199.) It suffices here to give a description of the plant as it grows on the grounds of 
 this Station. 

Plants very vigorous, a stronger grower than the ordinary dewberry, semi-trailing, 
 tender in the East, hardy in the West where the temperature does not reach zero, very 
 productive under favorable conditions, healthy; canes medium to slender, pubescent, 
 cylindrical, brownish red mingled with green, eglandular; prickles slender, very numerous, 
 reddish; leaflets 3-5, broad-oval or heart-shaped resembling the raspberry, very thick, 
 large, dull, rugose, pubescent, with finely serrate margins; petiole medium in length, rather 
 thick. Flowers mid-season, white, in open, leafy clusters; petals roundish; pedicels long, 
 thick, tomentose, prickly, eglandular; calyx very prickly, eglandular; calyx-lobes tomentose, 
 bristly without, eglandular. Fruit early, clings rather tenaciously, ripens slowly; long- 
 cylindrical-conic or ovate, large, glossy red; drupelets numerous, rather large, pubescent; 
 core hard ; flesh juicy, pleasantly sprightly at full maturity, otherwise rather acid, with a 
 peculiar raspberry flavor, which is improved by cooking, firm enough to ship well ; good in 
 quality.

 As we have seen in a previous chapter, Lucretia was one of the first cultivated dew- 
 berries to make its way into popular favor. Perhaps it is not too much to say that it is 
 still the best known and most widely grown of all dewberries, if the loganberry, here included 
 with dewberries, be excepted. At the same time it is probable that it is past its prime in 
 popular favor and that it is being superseded by other sorts. This dewberry came to its 
 high estate in the small-fruit culture of the coimtry because the plants grew splendidly 
 on a great diversity of soils and in a range of latitudes from the coldest to the warmest 
 in which this fruit can be grown. The plants have the faults of being susceptible to anthrac- 
 nose, and of producing many double blossoms which are sterile. The fruits are large, 
 jet black, very handsome, not of the highest quality, and are often variable in size. To
