Austin. 5. Am. Pom. Soc. Cat. 16. 1897. 

Of little account in New York and the East, Mayes is considered one of the best dew- 
 berries in sections of the Middle West, and especially in northern Texas where it is largely 
 grown in commercial plantations. Earliness, productiveness, great vigor of plant, and 
 remarkable powers to resist dry, hot weather seem to be the characters that commend 
 Mayes. It is too tender to cold for northern regions. The berries are comparatively 
 small, rather soft to ship well, but are handsome and of very good quality. The plants are 
 subject to anthracnose and bear a good many double blossoms; they are propagated either 
 by tips or from root cuttings. Mayes was found growing wild by John Mayes, Pilot Point, 
 Texas, about 1880. It is supposed to be a hybrid between the wild dewberry and the 
 common blackberry. The variety was cultivated by Mr. Mayes and known locally as 
 Mayes or Mayes Hybrid. Later it was sent out by J. W. Austin, of Pilot Point, as Austin 
 Improved. The American Pomological Society listed the variety as Austin in its fruit 
 catalog in 1897, but two years later changed the name to Mayes. 

Plants vigorous, trailing, tender to cold, sometimes productive but variable in yield; 
 subject to anthracnose and double-blossom; propagated by root-cuttings, also by tips; 
 canes long, slender, numerous, greenish, cylindrical, glossy, eglandular or with but very 
 few almost sessile, small glands, nearly glabrous; prickles slender, very numerous, light 
 red at the base; leaflets 3-5, sometimes 7, variable in size, oval, dull dark green, rather 
 smooth, pubescent, with coarsely dentate margins; petiole short, slender. Flowers self- 
 fertile, midseason, large, in the axils of the leaves and terminal, in long, very loose, leafy, 
 prickly clusters; petals white, oblong; pedicels very long, thick, with but few small glands. 
 Fruit very early, can not be shipped far, holds up well in size; berries few in a cluster, 
 either singly or sometimes in twos and threes, roundish to long-conic, thick, broad at the 
 base, jet black; calyx large, not refiexed; drupelets very large, round, rather few; core hard 
 at first, medium to soft when fully ripe; flesh very juicy, firm imtil dead ripe, very sprightly, 
 distinctly acid even when fully ripe; quality good to very good.
