240 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Plants extremely vigorous, trailing, tender to cold, variable in yield, sometimes very 
 productive, almost immune to anthracnose and orange-rust ; propagated from tips and from 
 root-cuttings; canes extremely prickly, perennial, numerous, medium to slender, grooved, 
 dull reddish brown, slightly pubescent and glandular; prickles large, long, thick, very 
 stout, strongly hooked, verj' numerous, light brown at the base; foliage ornamental; leaf- 
 lets evergreen, cut-leaved, small, broad-ovate, dissected into several linear, sharp-toothed 
 divisions; the younger leaves very glossy, rugose, glabrous, thinly pubescent, puberulous 
 beneath, with deeply lobed, coarsely serrate margins; petiole short, very prickly. Flowers 
 vmusually late, blooming season long, medium to numerous, in open, leafy, prickly clusters; 
 petals pale pink or rose colored, oblong; pedicels short; calyx-segments prickly. Fruit 
 imusually late, ripening over a long season, said to ship and keep well; variable in size, 
 irregularly roundish, glossy black, adhering strongly; drupelets very large, with strong 
 coherence; core hard; flesh juicy, firm, sprightly or sour; quality poor.

This variety, supposed to be a cross between the western dewberry and the Cuthbert 
 red raspberry, is so similar to the loganberry that it is usually classed with it. It does not 
 thrive on the grounds of this Station, but its champions on the Pacific Slope say that the 
 fruits are brighter, sweeter, richer, and have a more distinct raspberry flavor than those of 
 the loganberry. Both Phenomenal and the loganberry are subject to a disease which dwarfs 
 the plants and cuts short their life to but three or four profitable seasons. Phenomenal 
 seems to be more subject to this dwarfing disease than the loganberry. The berries, 
 also, often grow double, which disfigures them for the market. In the plants, the canes of 
 Phenomenal are a little hardier; the blossoms open a few days later; and the berries are a 
 little larger. There are those, however, who say that neither the differences noted in fruits 
 or plants are inherent but come for most part from environment or care. Phenomenal is 
 of small importance in regions where the loganberry is well established, except about Los 
 Angeles where it is grown by some in preference to the older sort. It does not succeed in 
 New York. This variety was introduced by Luther Burbank, Santa Rosa, California, 
 nearly twenty years ago. In 1909 the American Pomological Society added the variety 
 to its fruit-catalog list. 

Plants very vigorous, trailing, tender to cold, variable in yield, not always healthy; 
 canes stocky to medium, cylindrical, purplish green mingled with brown, dull, very glaucous, 
 pubescent, eglandular; prickles mediinn in size and length, slender, very numerous, pur- 
 plish red, leaflets 3-5, broad-oval, dark green, rugose, pubescent, characteristically thick, 
 with dentate margins; petiole short, thick. Flowers early, in short, loose, leafless clusters; 
 petals white, oblong; pedicels medium in length and thickness; calyx eglandular, elongated. 
 Fruit early; large, often double, long-conic, broad at the base, dull red, adheres strongly; 
 drupelets medium in size and number, with strong coherence; core soft; flesh juicy, tender, 
 mildly subacid; quality fair.
