THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 24 1 

be either a seedling or a sport. The plants are very similar to those of Lucretia, but ripen 
 their crop a week or ten days earlier, are not so productive, and bear more imperfect flowers. 
 The fruits probably average a little smaller than those of Lucretia. Most growers think 
 that the plants are not as productive as those of Lucretia. The variety is not of much 
 importance in New York and the North, but seems to be a favorite eariy dewberry in some 
 parts of the South, notably in North Carolina. But little seems to be known of the history 
 of this variety but it has been under cultivation since 1905. It is supposed to have been 
 found in a patch of Lucretia. 

Plants medium in vigor, trailing, tender to cold, variable in yield, usually healthy; 
 canes numerous, slender, cylindrical, dull green, pubescent; prickles slender, short, few, 
 reddish at the base; leaflets 3-5, variable in size, broad-oval, thick, dark green, rugose, 
 pubescent, with serrate margins; petiole thick, medium in length, deeply channeled, with 
 but few prickles. Flowers midseason, often self-sterile, large, white, few, in short, open, 
 leafy clusters; pedicels long, heavily pubescent, with but few prickles; calyx large; pistils 
 irregular, sometimes protruding from the flower buds before the petals open. Fruit very 
 early; large, irregularly oblong-oval, attractive black; drupelets large, round, with good 
 coherence; core soft; flesh juicy, moderately firm and sprightly; quality good to very 
 good.

Primus was originated by Luther Burbank, Santa Rosa, California, in 1889, as a cross 
 between the western dewbeny-, Rubus vitifoliiis, and Rubiis crataegif alius; introduced by 
 Burbank in '1893. Plant a strong grower, productive, partially trailing, thickly covered 
 with short, blunt prickles, propagated by tips; fruit large, long, black, sweet, resembling 
 a raspberry in flavor, adhering to the core; ripens earlier than the loganberry. 
 Rogers, i. Am. Pom. Soc. Rpt. 286. 1921. 

Discovered near Alvin, Texas, by a Mr. Rogers; introduced about 1893 by C. Falkner, 
 Waco, Texas. Fruit large, a good shipper; excellent in quality; early. ' 

San Jacinto, i. Austin Nur. Cat. 16. 1907. 

Found by F. T. Ramsey, Austin, Texas, and introduced by F. T. Ramsey & Son about 
 1896. At this Station it is tender to cold and unproductive. Plants trailing, moderately 
 vigorous, not hardy, rather unproductive; canes slender, densely covered with fine reddish 
 spines and glandular hairs; foliage very small; fruit small; early. 

Skagit Chief, i. Cornell Sta. Bui. 34:310. 1891. 

Introduced in Avon, Washington, in 1891. Flowers pistillate, blooming too early 
 for pollination by eastern dewberries.

Sorsby May. 3. Mvmson Cat. 10. 1901. 

Introduced in 1901 by T. V. Munson & Son, Denison, Texas. It is said to be a black- 
 berry-dewberry hybrid, the plants resembling those of McDonald. It requires winter 

protection in this latitude, and being self-sterile, much of the fruit is poorly developed.
