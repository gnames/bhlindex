One suspects from these names that the list is somewhat padded and 
 that not half of the number are distinct sorts. Hogg in 1866 includes all 
 of these names tmder six varieties. In the twenty names, only two are 
 familiar to currant growers today, — Red and White Dutch. 

Taking another casual dip in British pomology at a still later date we 
 find that Hogg, 1866, describes nine varieties of red currants, six of which are 
 put on a select list. At least three of the six recommended sorts are more 
 than a hundred years old and two, Red and White Dutch, go back to the 
 very beginning of currant culture in England and on the continent. Up 
 until this time those who had sought to improve plants had given the currant 
 scant attention, although three of Hogg's nine varieties were originated 
 by Thomas Andrew Knight, England's premier breeder of fruits. 

The history of the currant on the continent of Europe parallels that 
 of this fruit in England. There are, however, earlier references on the 
 continent than those given from English books. E. L. Sturtevant, a 
 former director of this Station, and a careful student of early agricultural 
 literature, has left voluminous notes on the history of cultivated esculents. 
 The paragraph that follows is taken from Sturtevant's notes (Western 
 New York Horticultural Society Proceedings, page 56, 1887) and possibly 
 presents as good an account of the early cultivation of this fruit as can be 
 found. 

" By the herbalists and early writers on horticulture, the first mention 
 of the currant that I find, is by Ruellius - in 1536, a French author, who 
 praises it as a border plant, and its fruit as an appetizer. In 1539, 
 Ammonius ^ says " we cherish it in our gardens," but adds nothing of further 
 interest in this connection. Fuchsius * in 1542 gives a figure which may be 
 called a poor specimen of the Common Red, and which resembles certain 
 seedlings which are now frequently obtained. He notes its occurrence in 
 gardens passim. Tragus,^ who wrote in Germany in 1552, gives a figure of
