248 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

the garden currant, which may well be the Common Red. In 1558, 
 Matthiolus ^ refers to it as common in gardens, and it is also spoken of by 
 Mizaldus ^ in 1560. Pinaeus,' 1561, gives a figure which may be that of a 
 Common Red, while Lobel ^ in 1576 and 1591 offers figures which are to 
 be called Common Red, but which are of a far better appearance than those 
 heretofore figured, and mentions also a sweet kind. Lytes translation of 
 Dodoeus, edition of 1586, speaks of the currant in England, but translates 
 one name as ' beyond the sea ' gooseberry. This same year 1586, Came- 
 rarius^ figures the Common Red, as does Dalechamp^ in 1587. The next 
 year, Camerarius ^ gives directions for sowing the seed of the wild plant 
 in gardens, and says these seedlings quickly come to fruit. We have hence 
 the first clue as to how new varieties might originate, if this recommenda- 
 tion was generally followed. Camerarius also refers to a larger fruited 
 currant than common, that was growing in the gardens of the Archduke 
 of Austria, and this is the first indication I can note of improvement in 
 varieties, such as might well be anticipated from the practice of growing 
 seedlings. This ' Ribes baccis riibris majoribus ' may perhaps be considered 
 as the Red Dutch variety, or at least its prototype. In 1597, Gerarde,* 
 as before stated, scarcely recognized the currant as being in general culture 
 in England, but the next year, or 1598, brings us to what may well be called 
 a picture of the Red Dutch variety, given in Bauhin's edition of Matthiolus, 
 as also a mention of a white fruited variety, and another described as 
 ' sweet.' " 

Sturtevant's history of the currant begins with Ruellius, 1536, a French 
 author. De Candolle, without question the best authority on edible plants 
 who has yet written, also gives Ruellius credit of being the first writer on 
 plants to mention the currant as cultivated. But Bunyard, 1917 (Journal 
 of the Royal Horticultural Society pages 260-270, 191 7) who reviews the 
 botanical, garden, and historical literature of this fruit, tells us that the 
 currant is mentioned in a German MS. of the early fifteenth century and 
 that there is a very good discussion of a red currant in the Mainz Herbarius 
 of 1484. It does not follow that the plant was as yet domesticated, but 
 since certain medical qualities had been ascribed to it, it is probable that 
 it was grown in the herb garden at this time if not in the kitchen garden.
