Bunyard, in his admirable history of the currant in the reference cited, also 
 gives dates and details as to the introduction of the several species of cur- 
 rants but into this we cannot go other than in the references accompanying 
 the botanical descriptions in the chapter on Systematic Botany of the Currant. 

There is little of interest or of profit to the pomologist in the history 
 of the currant in America. The earliest English settlers in Massachusetts, 
 as we have seen, brought this fruit to the new country. Probably the sorts 
 brought were the Red and White Dutch, and the fact that after three hun- 
 dred years we still grow these varieties is significant, — there have been few 
 attempts to improve the currant in America. The list of American varieties 
 is now larger than that of Europe, not because of the efforts of plant breeders, 
 but because the currant is grown over a vastly greater territory here than 
 in Europe, and new varieties have originated by chance in the varied 
 environments. 

The Prince Niu-series, Flushing, Long Island, in 1 770 offered to gardeners 
 three varieties. Large Red, Large White, and Large Black. In 1790 this 
 nursery was selling the same sorts. McMahon, in his American Gardener' s 
 Calendar, 1806, names the Common Red, Large Red, Pale White Dutch, 
 Large White, and White Crystal, but without description so that we cannot 
 know what they were. His directions for pruning, propagating, and culture 
 would answer excellently for currant culture in the modern industry. 
 McMahon tells his readers that currants may be " raised from seed and 
 improved sorts obtained thereby." Would that we could take the date of 
 this advice as the beginning of currant breeding in America, but intelligent 
 sowing of seed with the selection of seedlings seems not to have been begun 
 in the case of the currant in this country for another half century. 

Prince, the next pomological writer to mention currants, in his Treatise 
 on Horticulture, 1828, names seven kinds, all European, and although there 
 are no descriptions, the seven names, following English descriptions, stand 
 for but four distinct varieties. Downing in The Fruits and Fruit Trees of 
 America, 1845, describes eight varieties, not cotinting the Common Red 
 and the Common White, which he says " are totally undeserving a place 
 in the garden, when those very superior sorts, the White and Red Dutch, 
 can be obtained." White Dutch at this time was grown under five other 
 names and Red Dutch was listed under eight besides its true one. Down- 
 ing's book was revised in 1857 when twenty-five varieties were thought 
 worthy brief descriptions ■ — all from Europe.
