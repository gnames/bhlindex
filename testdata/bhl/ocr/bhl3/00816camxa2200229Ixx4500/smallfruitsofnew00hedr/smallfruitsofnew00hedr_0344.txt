250 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Andrew S. Fuller, in whose The Small Fruit CuUurist, 1867, we find an 
 admirable discussion, with very good descriptions, of the currants grown in 
 America. Twenty-eight varieties are listed with some forty-odd synonyms. 
 There is, as in all lists of currants from the first to the last, much confusion 
 in the nomenclature, and Fuller now makes an honest effort to set currant 
 growers straight as to correct names. He describes two sorts of American 
 origin, Bmst's Long-bunched Red, and Dana's White. Neither are now, or 
 ever were, of much value. Fuller relates an experience in obtaining Dana's 
 White that many collectors of currants could duplicate with other varieties. 
 He says that he obtained, from what he supposed to be reliable sources, 
 five distinct varieties under this name. 

Perhaps the next noteworthy contribution to our knowledge of 
 American-grown currants is foiind in a publication from this Station. As 
 early as 1882, the first year of the Station's existence, the beginning of a 
 collection of currants was made by the planting of twelve kinds. By 1890 
 this number had increased to twenty-odd varieties, all but two of which 
 were old European sorts. Now, however, a rapid development in currant 
 improvement began to take place. Between 1890 and 1895, fifteen cur- 
 rants, all of American origin, were added to the collection. True, some of 
 these did not come into prominence but others, as Wilder, North Star, 
 Red Cross, Eclipse, Ruby, and Pomona, made their appearance in this 
 period as sorts worthy widespread cviltivation. The first account of these 
 studies of the currant at the New York Agrictiltural Experiment Station 
 appeared in Bulletin 95, 1895, since which, imtil the present work, the 
 currant and its varieties have had but occasional mention. 

The next survey of the varieties of currants grown in the United States 
 appears in Card's Bush-Fruits, 1898. Card lists 58 varieties of red and white 
 currants with histories and descriptions as full as the data obtainable per- 
 mitted. Of these, 25 probably originated in America. Not all of them, 
 by any means, are under cultivation. Some of the names are synonyms. 
 A good many of the varieties, as Card says, have only received mention or 
 have been little known in the United States. This list includes only varieties 
 cultivated in America. 

The most thorough study of cultivated currants made in America up 
 to date is that of Paul Thayer, the results of which are published in Ohio 
 Station Bulletin No. 371, The Red and White Currants, 1923. Thayer 
 grew " more than 200 lots tinder 100 names." These, after much critical 
 study, he resolves into 41 major and about 180 minor varieties, of which
