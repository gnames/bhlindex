he gives for each the botany, origin, history, and a full description. Thayer's 
 studies also include the botany of the currant, both structural and syste- 
 matic. All in all, it is the most notable pomological monograph yet 
 published on the currant. 

This brings us to the present work. In The Small Fruits of New 
 York, 185 currants are described; of which 109 kinds have originated on 
 this side of the Atlantic. The confusion in names and varieties is so great 
 and of so long standing that duplication is unavoidable, and so many of 
 the varieties described no longer exist that probably not a quarter of 
 those described can now be obtained in American and European nurseries. 
 Not more than eighteen or twenty varieties are cultivated in America, 
 and less than half of these are of commercial importance. The acreage 
 and yield of currants in America are shown by the figures in Table 3 taken 
 from the last census.
