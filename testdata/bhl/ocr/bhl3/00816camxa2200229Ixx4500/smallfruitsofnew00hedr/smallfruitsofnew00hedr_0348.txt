THE SYSTEMATIC BOTANY OF CURRANTS AND 
 GOOSEBERRIES 

Several species each of Ribes and Grossularia are commonly cultivated 
 in cool temperate and even sub-arctic climates under the names currants and 
 gooseberries. The two genera are put by many botanists in a subtribe of 
 the family Saxifragaceae, while others find them sufficiently different from 
 other saxifrage-like plants to put them in a distinct family, Grossulariaceae, 
 a procedure followed in this text. While species of the two genera are 
 very different in aspect of plant, and in appearance and flavor of fruit, 
 yet their close relationship is shown by similarities in botanical characters 
 and by the hybridization of species in the two genera and the possibility 
 of intergrafting. The two genera possess the following characters in 
 common : â€” 

They are shrubs of various habit, usually flowering from the old wood 
 and sending up every year a number of young cions to replace the older 
 decaying stems. On young branches the bark usually peels, and some 
 species bear bristles along the intemodes or spines at the nodes or below 
 the insertion of the leaves. The leaves are alternate or spirally arranged 
 on the longer branches, or clustered on the short lateral branchlets; they are 
 stalked, without stipules, simple and more or less lobed and toothed. 

The flowers are produced in racemes from the end of short lateral 
 branchlets, usually at the time of the leaves unfolding in spring. Sometimes 
 the racemes are short and even reduced to one flower (Grossularia). In 
 Ribes the flowers are more numerous, from 6-20 or more in a raceme. 
 Each pedicel is subtended by a small bract, and often two much smaller 
 bractlets are seen below the ovary. 

The ovary is inferior, i -celled, with two parietal placentas and with 
 several or numerous ovules. The cal)TC-tube or receptacle varies from 
 flat to cup-shaped, urn-shaped to tubular, it has 5, rarely 4, segments or 
 sepals and as many petals inserted alternately at the top of the receptacle. 
 The stamens, equal in number, are inserted opposite the sepals. The 
 style is more or less deeply cleft, often halfway down, into 2, rarely 3, 
 lobes or branches. 

The fruits are i -celled pulpy berries, with several or many horizontal 
 angular seeds; embryo minute, terete, embedded in the fleshy endosperm.
