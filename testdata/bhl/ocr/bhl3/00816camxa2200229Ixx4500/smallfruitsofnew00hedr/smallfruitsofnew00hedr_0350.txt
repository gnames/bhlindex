256 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

BB. Branches with bristles and nodal spines; flowers rotate in drooping racemes, 

glandular Gooseberry-stemmed Currants: VI. Grossulariaides

B. Racemes erect Alpine Currants : VII. Berisia

About 125 species of currants are known. Most of them are natives 
 of the temperate and cooler regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Northern 
 Asia and Europe possess a large number of them, but by far the greatest 
 number inhabit America. The mountains of the Pacific Coast from Alaska 
 to Patagonia are especially rich in species. Most of these western and 
 southern American Ribes are ornamental, sometimes evergreen and deli- 
 cate shrubs. None have so far proved to possess any value from the 
 pomological point of view, nevertheless some might be profitably used in 
 hybridizing. With a few exceptions, the currants ctdtivated for their 
 fruits are natives of the Old World, particularly of Europe, from the 
 Pyrenees to Scandinavia. No species enters the tropics in the Old World 
 on account of the mountain chains stretching from east to west and causing 
 sharp climatic separations.

 Nat. de Gentve 35:Pt. 3, 235. 1902. 

Red Currants. â€” Unarmed shrubs, young shoots with thin papery outer bark soon 
 peeling off. Buds middle sized, scales leathery. 

Leaves plicate in bud, more or less maple-shaped, 3- to 5- to 7-lobed, with as many 
 palmately branched veins, lobes mostly pointed; the base cordate or truncate; more or less 
 pubescent, at least when young or entirely glabrous; glands, when present on the young 
 growth, small, crj^stalline, not viscid, inodorous. 

Inflorescence racemose ; rhachis slender, pedicels from the axils of small bracts, articu- 
 lated below the flower; bracteoles small or wanting. 

Flowers with a rotate, pelviform (shallowly cup-shaped), turbinate or campanulate 
 receptacle, modestly colored, mostly greenish, yellow to reddish or dark. The bottom 
 of the receptacle concave or flat or with a disc-like, peculiar, somewhat pentangular rim 
 or with 5 roundish humps below the petals. Calyx-lobes or sepals roundish, often broader 
 than long, patent or rectu-ved. Petals small cuneiform or flabelliform, usually a little 
 brighter colored. Stamens inserted opposite the sepals, filaments short, anthers sometimes 
 with an exceptionally broad connective. Style more or less deeply bifid. Ovary inferior 
 or semi-inferior, roundish or turbinate, smooth. 

Fruits mostly globular or oblong- rotmdish, mostly red, sometimes uncolored or white, 
 or dark purple, crowned by the remains of the withered flower; mostly acidulous or insipid; 
 seeds ovoid, numerous. 

This subgenus comprises 15 more or less closely rel'ated species, natives 
 of the Northern Hemisphere, out of which the following constitute our culti- 
 vated red currants.
