260 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Red Dutch, White Dutch, and Perfection are typical of this group of 
 hybrids. These hybrids resemble R. sativum rather than R. rubruni in 
 habit; they are usually recognized by the shape of the leaves. The lateral 
 lobes are not so spreading as in R. sativum, but point more forward. The 
 sinuses between the terminal and the lateral lobes are therefore acute as a 
 rule. The underside of the leaves is also more and often permanently 
 pubescent. The teeth are large and round as in R. sativum. The racemes 
 are spreading and gently recurved, puberulent. The flowers are almost 
 the same as in R. sativum, but they are less flat and more shallowly cup- 
 shaped and have a slightly raised ring. The anthers have a more or less 
 widened connective. R. hotightoniamim occurs also in a subspontaneous 
 or spontaneous state. 

Another hybrid with promising characters is:

 Robust shrub; leaves rather large, cordate at the base, subglabrous. Flowers much 
 like in R. sativum macrocarpum, receptacle slightly and shallowly cup-shaped, often red- 
 dish brown with a faint ring. Fruits rather large, acidulous. Raised by Janczewski in 
 1903.

Northern Red Currant. â€” Erect shrub, 1-2 m high, young growth smooth or pubes- 
 cent. Leaves broader than long, 3- to 5-lobed, the lobes ovoid-deltoid, rather short, the 
 lateral ones pointing forward and hence the sides often almost parallel, the teeth rather 
 small, the base truncate, reniform or sometimes cordate with scattered short hairs on the 
 upper side, more or less pubescent beneath, 4-9 cm long and 5-1 1 cm wide. Petiole 
 about 3-5 cm (8 cm, Janczewski) long, pubescent, more or less ciliate near the base. 

Racemes 3-8 cm long, ascending or patent, not drooping, rather loose; rhachis and 
 pedicels slightly pubescent or with minute crystalline glands; bracts small, ovate, obtuse 
 or pointed, patent or recurving; pedicels up to 5 mm long, thin, occasionally with bracteoles 
 below the ovary. Flowers shallowly cup-shaped or broadly funnel-shaped, pale green or
