262 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Eastern Siberia. 

(5) var. palzewskii. Janczewski Monogr. 290. 1907. 

Robust shrub, 1.5 m; young shoots reddish, with scattered hairs. Leaves glabrous, 
 longer than wide, 11 cm to 9 cm, 3-lobed, the lobes deltoid, pointed, the base tnmcate or 
 wedge-shaped decurrent between the veins. Petiole about half as long as the blade (5 
 cm) , glabrous, reddish. Raceme very short with a few pale flowers. Fruit ovoid or elliptic, 
 acidulous. 

Eastern Manchuria. Remarkable for its foliage. 

R. rubrum Linn, is the northern red currant. It is easily distinguished 
 from R. sativum by its leaves. The lateral lobes of these leaves always 
 point forward, not spreading laterally, and the angles or sinuses between 
 the terminal and the lateral lobes are consequently acute. The bases of 
 the leaves vary considerably from heart-shaped or reniform to truncate 
 or even rounded; the basal lobes, however, never touch or overlap as in 
 R. sativum. Usually the leaf-blades are smaller than in R. sativum. The 
 flowers are somewhat deeper and not as flat as in R. sativum and never have 
 the thickened ring at the bottom which is so characteristic of R. sativum. 
 Only a few commonly cultivated varieties are direct descendants of R. 
 rubrum. According to Janczewski, however, there are varieties with red, 
 rose-colored, and white berries, cultivated in northern Europe, especially 
 in Lithuania, which have never found their way into the gardens of western 
 Etirope or into general cultivation.

Erect shrub, 1-2 m high. Leaves rather large, roundish, with a cordate base, 3- to 
 5-lobed, lobes short, ovate, glabrous above, slightly pubescent beneath, especially along the 
 veins, 9 cm long and 10 cm wide; petiole pubescent, ciliate near the base, about 6 cm long. 
 Racemes drooping, about 5 cm long or more and with about 15 flowers; rhachis more 
 or less pubescent, mottled with red; bracts small, ovoid; pedicels pubescent, 3 mm long; 
 flower buds coppery red. Flowers smooth, changing from coppery red to pale flesh colored. 
 Receptacle broadly funnel-shaped, widened above the ovary, inside flat, with a shallow rim 
 best visible in longitudinal section; sepals roimdish, broader than long but finally lengthen- 
 ing and spatulate; petals small, wedge-shaped, reddish; filaments as long as the petals, 
 inserted on the edge of the receptacle, anthers large, roundish ; style as high as the anthers, 
 bifid. Fruits roimdish, blackish purple, very acid, ripening in July. 
 Eastern Siberia, Yakoutsk, Ochotsk, and the lower Amur. 
 AlHed to R. rubrum, flowers of the same shape, but larger, more highly 
 colored, and racemes pendulous; fruits more acid. This is a very produc- 
 tive currant. See also its hybrid with R. sativum macrocarpum : R. futurum.
