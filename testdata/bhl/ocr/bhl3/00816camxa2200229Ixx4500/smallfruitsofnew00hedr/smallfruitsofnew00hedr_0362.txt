268 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

in trade and one hardly knows which names are rightly applied, as the 
 original descriptions of the varieties are instifficient for identification. 
 An attempt to find a method of classification has been made by Ronald 
 G. Hatton at the Fruit Experiment Station, East Mailing, England. 
 {Jour. Pom. 1:65, 80, 145-154. 1919.) The black currant has been crossed 
 with the European gooseberry; and this hybrid, R. nigrum x Grossularia 
 reclinata, is known as R. culverwellii, MacFarlane Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. 
 37:203. 1892; Card. Chron. 3d Ser. 28:7. 1900. 

It was first raised by a Mr. Culverwell, Thorpe Perrow, Yorkshire, 
 in 1880. (See Card. Chron. 19:635. 1883.) It has been repeatedly pro- 
 duced, also the reversed cross {R. Sclineideri Maiirer in Koehne Garten- 
 flora 409. 1902.) At Geneva the cross has been made several times and 
 a great number of individuals were grown which represented all possible 
 intermediate forms of the two species. Some individuals were scarcely 
 different from R. nigrum, others were more like Grossularia, but aU were 
 unarmed and not all had the peculiar scent of R. nigrum.
