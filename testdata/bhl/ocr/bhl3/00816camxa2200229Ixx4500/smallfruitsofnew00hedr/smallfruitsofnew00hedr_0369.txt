Originated by Dr. Van Fleet and distributed by the United States 
 Department of Agriculture in Washington; cultivated at this Station. It 
 holds its foliage late in the fall and is said to be promising for southern 
 regions. The flowers resemble those of R. siiccirubnun {G. nivea x divaricata) . 
 It must not be confused with the gooseberry variety Van Fleet, introduced 
 by T. G. Lovett in 19 17 which was also raised by Dr. Van Fleet, but from 
 Houghton X (Keepsake x Industry) Fa generation.
