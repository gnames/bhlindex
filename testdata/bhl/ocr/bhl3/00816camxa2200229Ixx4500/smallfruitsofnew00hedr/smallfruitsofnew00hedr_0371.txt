THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 277 

very variable species, usually confounded with G. oxyacanthoides and 
 G. inermis, easily recognized from both by the characteristic cuneate leaf 
 bases. This species has been much employed by hybridizers to produce 
 American varieties of gooseberries. The variety Pale Red (American 
 Seedling, Cluster, or Ohio Seedling) is, according to Hedrick Cyclopedia of 
 Hardy Fruits, 309. 1922, a pure-bred of this species. 

(i) var. calcicola Femald (1. c.)- 

Differs chiefly by densely pubescent leaves and bracts and purplish 
 pubescent flowers and ovaries. 

It is found in marly swamps and on limestone rocks from Michigan to 
 New England and Quebec. 

G. downingiana Berger {G. hirtella x reclinata.) 

Shrub with slender arching branches, older ones with cherry-like brown bark, younger 
 ones gray, usually without bristles; nodal spines 3 or i, subulate, 5-10 mm long. Leaves 
 variable in shape, some rovmdish and with a broad truncate or also subcordate base, others 
 obovate with a decidedly wedge-shaped base; 3- to 5-lobed, lobes obtuse, crenate, of rather 
 thin texture, glabrous above, paler and slightly pubescent or glabrous at length under- 
 neath. Petiole pubescent and with scattered plumose, sometimes glandular, fringes. 
 Peduncles shorter than the petioles, glabrous, 2- to 3-flowered; bracts roundish, pubescent, 
 and fimbriate. Ovary small, pear-shaped, glabrous; receptacle bell-shaped, bright or pale 
 green, inside with numerous long white hairs near the throat, sepals a little longer, oblong, 
 obtuse, recurved, green or slightly tinged with red inside at the base and along the margins, 
 smooth or with a few scattered hairs at the back; petals about half as long, obovate-cuneate, 
 with a revolute margin at the top, white; stamens white, as long as the sepals, anthers 
 oblong, greenish; style deeply bifid, villous at the base. Berries roundish oval, green or 
 dark red, glabrous with a thin skin, agreeable; seeds small, numerous. 

This hybrid originated in cultivation in the United States. To this 
 belong most of the American gooseberry varieties, like Downing, Carrie, 
 Oregon, Pearl, Poorman, Josselyn, Smith, Van Fleet, etc.

Ribes rusticum. Janczewski Bui. Ac. Sci. Nat. Crac. 3:286. 1906; Janczewski 
 Monogr. 495. 1907. 

Shrub with erect, rather stout, grayish branches; nodal spines 1-3, subulate; growing 
 shoots downy. Leaves broader than long, roimdish with a broadly tnmcate or subcordate, 
 rarely somewhat wedge-shaped base, 3- to s-lobed, lobes obtuse dentate, rather soft and 
 thin, shortly and sparingly puberulous above at first, paler and densely pubescent beneath, 
 glabrescent later on. Petioles hirsute and with scattered plumose fringes. Pedxincles 
 shorter than the petioles, hirsute, 2- to 3-flowered; bracts roundish, hirsute, and ciliate, 
 pedicels pubescent. Ovary small, pyriform, more or less tomentose ; receptacle bell-shaped, 
 hairy inside, green, like the sepals more or less pubescent; sepals oblong, obtuse, reflexed, a 
 little longer than the receptacle, more or less tinged with red along the margins and at the
