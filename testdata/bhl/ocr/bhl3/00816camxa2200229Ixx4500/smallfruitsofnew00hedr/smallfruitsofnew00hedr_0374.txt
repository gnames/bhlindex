280 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Central Europe to Scandinavia; on rocks and in dry places. It starts 
 to grow about a fortnight later than the species. 

The cultivated varieties of gooseberries as they are grown in Europe, 
 and chiefly in England, are all descendants of Grossularia reclinata and its 
 varieties. It is chiefly from the typical form of this species with shining 
 leaves and glandular-hairy ovary that most of the cultivated varieties 
 derive. From the variety G. reclinata uva-crispa with dull green pubescent 
 leaves and pubescent, rarely glandular ovary, only a few horticultural 
 varieties are cultivated, but as they are smaller than the others they are 
 not much planted and are likely to be lost. G. reclinata uva-crispa is, 
 however, a more drouth-resisting plant and, although its fruits are smaller, 
 yet they are very sweet and ripen later than the others, all valuable qualities 
 for the plant breeder.
