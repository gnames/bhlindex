Coleur de Chair. 4. Duhamel Trait. Arb.Fr. 1:267. 1768. 

This old variety is probably a cross between the common red and the common white 
 currants. The wood and foliage are very similar to that of the common red. The American 
 Pomological Society included the variety in its fruit catalog from 1862 to 1871. Plants 
 vigorous, productive; bunches medium in length, loose; berries large, pale pink, rather 
 acid; late. Esteemed in France for making jelly. 
 Champagne White, i. Can. Cent. Exp. Farm Bui. 56:14. 1907. 

Plants vigorous, upright, moderately productive; bunches medium to long, half -filled; 
 berries medium to large, pale yellow, subacid, with a pleasant flavor; good; midseason. 

Champion, i. N. Y. Sta. Bui. gs: 427. 1895. 

As grown at this Station the plants are upright, vigorous ; bunches of medium length ; 
 berries variable, small to large, a shade lighter in color than White Dutch, flavor mild; 
 inferior to White Dutch. 

Chautauqua, i. W. N. Y. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 26. 1904. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 385:311- 
 1914. 3. Ohio Sta. Bui. 371:32 y. 1923. 

Chautauqua Climbing. 4. Rural N. F. 61:848. 1902. 

The long growth of the canes of this variety can be trained against a wall or trellis 
 until they reach a height of ten or twelve feet. This character accounts for the synon}^!, 
 Chautauqua Climbing. The variety is among the best in a collection of forty sorts on the 
 grounds of this Station. The plants are vigorous, healthy and very productive. The 
 clusters are unusually long, with stems free from berries at the base, and therefore easy to 
 pick. The berries are large, handsome, light red, high in quality, and hang long after 
 ripening. All in all, however, chiefly because of the unmanageable canes, the variety 
 cannot be recommended for commercial plantations, but may be desirable for trellises or 
 fences in home gardens. This currant is a chance seedling found in the woods by R. F. 
 Lonnen, Mayville, New York, about 1893. The variety was introduced by the Curtice 
 Nursery Company, Portland, New York, about 1901.
