Perhaps this is the most popular currant for home and market use in America. It 
 is esteemed for its large bunches and berries, and its vigorous, healthy plants. Cherry is 
 generally considered the most productive of the large-fruited red currants. The berries, 
 as the color plate shows, are beautiful bright red, of largest size, which, however, is not 
 always uniform. The fruits are juicy and of excellent quality, from which the large seeds 
 detract a little. In many localities the plants do not sucker freely, so that the bushes 
 sometimes have too few stalks. There is, also, a tendency in the canes to "go blind," 
 that is, to lack the terminal shoot. Harvesting is made a little difficult by the short-stemmed 
 bunches, the berries of which are so close to the wood that the crop is hard to pick. The 
 plants are so vigorous and so luxuriant in foliage that they might well be planted as orna- 
 mentals. This variety seems to have originated in Italy and was introduced into France 
 about 1840, and because of the extraordinary size of the fruit was named Cherry. It was 
 introduced into Flushing, New York, by Dr. William W. Valk in 1846. Cherry was 
 added to the recommended fruit list of the American Pomological Society in 1862. 

Plants meditim to large, vigorous, upright when young becoming more spreading 
 with age, dense, usually productive, healthy; young shoots few, very stocky, with a ten- 
 dency to imperfect buds at or near the ends of the shoots especially on bearing plants; 
 leaf -buds rather small, short, pointed, lean, appressed, glabrous; leaves deeply cordate at 
 the base, with obtuse lobes, medium in thickness and color, dull, rugose, with crenate 
 margins; petiole medium in length and thickness, pubescent, greenish. Flowers early, 
 in medium to long, drooping, rather few-flowered racemes; calyx- tube green mingled with 
 red, saucer-shaped, glabrous; calyx-lobes overlapping, pale green with slight red; ring well 
 developed, fleshy, distinctly brownish. Fruit early; clusters small, short, loose, with 10-13
