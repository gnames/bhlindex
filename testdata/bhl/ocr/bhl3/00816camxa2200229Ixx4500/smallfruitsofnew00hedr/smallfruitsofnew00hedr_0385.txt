THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 285 

Long grown very commonly in New York, Diploma is now becoming a favorite in 
 other currant regions as well. The berries are as large as those of the Cherry, considered 
 to bear the largest fruits of any currant, globular, bright rich crimson, and so transparent 
 that the seeds show plainly. The flesh is tender, abundantly juicy, slightly subacid; the 
 quality is good to ver>' good. The variety may be distinguished by its transparent skin 
 and flesh. The fruits are so juicy that they are especially desirable for jellies; for the 
 same reason the crop must be picked and handled with care. The plants are satisfactory 
 in every character. Diploma was originated by Jacob Moore, Attica, New York, in 1885, 
 as a seedling of Cherry crossed with White Grape. Charles A. Green, Rochester, New 
 York, sectired control of the stock and introduced it in igo6. 

Plants medium to large, vigorous, upright later becoming quite spreading, not very 
 dense, productive, healthy; young shoots numerous, stocky, rather brittle, reddish brown, 
 somewhat glossy; leaf -buds large, pointed, plump, pubescent, free; leaves subcordate to 
 truncate at the base, with obtuse lobes, medium in thickness, size, and color, dull, rugose, 
 glabrous, with crenate margins; petiole medium in length and thickness, greenish, pubescent. 
 Flowers midseason, in rather dense, drooping, few- to medium-flowered racemes; calyx- 
 tube greenish, saucer-shaped, glabrous; calyx-lobes obtuse, separated, glabrous, pale green 
 tinged brown beneath; petals much contracted at the base; ring well developed, fleshy; 
 ovary glabrous. Fruit midseason, period of ripening short; clusters medium in length, 
 filled poorly at the tips, loose, with rather few berries to the cluster; cluster-stems average 
 long and slender but variable; berry-stems medium to long; berries large, round, bright but 
 light red which changes but slowly after picking; skin smooth, thin, tender, very trans- 
 parent, the segments, veins and seeds unusually distinct; flesh semi-transparent, tender, 
 very juicy, sprightly subacid becoming mild; quality good to very good.
