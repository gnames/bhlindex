286 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Everybody, i. Lovett Cat. 8, f.g. 1914. 

Introduced about eleven years ago by J. T. Lovett, Little Silver, New Jersey. As 
 grown at this Station the plants are moderately vigorous, productive; clusters variable, 
 medium to short, well filled or with but few berries, which are large, dark red, subacid 
 and good in quality ; midseason.

Somewhat similar to Cherry and Diploma, just described, Fay is probably a better 
 sort the state over than either of these two, and by many is rated as the best of all the 
 large-fruited currants. Both the clusters and berries are very large and very uniform, 
 making the product very attractive. The cluster-stems are long, and therefore harvesting 
 is easy. The berries are of darker red, as the color plate shows, than many other of the 
 red currants, are sprightly, juicy, and thin-skinned, so that the fruits of this sort are about 
 the best of all for canning and jellies. The plants are not large, and the yield is not so 
 heavy as with some other varieties, so that unproductiveness is the chief defect. In some 
 localities the plants are subject to more of the ills of the currant than other standard 
 varieties. Yet, with these defects it is and probably will long remain one of the leading 
 commercial currants. Fay is a seedling produced about 1868 by Lincoln Fay, Portland, 
 New York. It is thought to be a cross between Victoria and Cherry. The variety was 
 introduced by George S. Josselyn, Fredonia, New York, in 1880. The American Pomo- 
 logical Society added the sort to its list of recommended fruits in 1883 under the name Fay's 
 Prolific but in i88g the name was shortened to Fay. 

Plants of medium size and productiveness, susceptible to anthracnose, vigorous, 
 sprawling in habit; yoimg shoots nvimerous, stocky, break easily; leaf -buds small, short, 
 pointed, lean, slightly pubescent, appressed; leaves rather large, cordate at the base, with 
 broadly obtuse lobes, thick, dull, rugose, glabrous, with crenate margins; petiole of medium 
 length, thick, greenish, pubescent. Flowers early, open before the leaves are well out, in 
 long, loose, drooping clusters; calj'x-tube greenish brown, saucer-shaped, glabrous; calyx- 
 lobes obtuse, thin, greenish yellow; ring very distinct, fleshy, red or brownish red; ovary 
 glabrous. Fruit early midseason; clusters large, medium to long, loose, with 12-15 berries, 
 drooping; cluster-stems variable in length averaging long- berry-stems medium to long; 
 berries cling well, large, smaller at the ends of the clusters, roundish, glossy, dark red; 
 skin smooth, thin, tough, translucent; flesh firm, juicy, very sprightly becoming pleasantly 
 subacid; quality very good.

 probationary period, and has found favor only in the neighborhood of its introduction, and
