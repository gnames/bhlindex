THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 287 

even there is now being grown less than formerly. The plants are not productive, and the 
 fruits are neither attractive in appearance nor high in quality. The plants sprawl on the 
 ground with great detriment to the currants and to the vexation of the cultivator. Per- 
 haps the variety fails because of its being unmanageable in the plantation more than for 
 any other reason. Filler originated in the garden of George Filler, Milton, New York, 
 about 1892. 

Plants dwarfish, medium in vigor, upright-spreading becoming drooping with age, 
 variable in yield, healthy; young shoots meditmi in nimiber; leaf-buds small, short, pointed, 
 nearly glabrous, appressed; leaves small to medixim, cordate at the base, with obtuse 
 lobes, rugose, glabrous, with crenate margins; petiole variable in length and thickness, 
 very slightly pubescent. Flowers midseason, above medium in size, in few-flowered, droop- 
 ing racemes, variable in compactness; calyx-tube greenish, saucer-shaped, glabrous; 
 calyx-lobes separated or occasionally overlapping, obtuse, pale green with few red streaks; 
 ring greenish, well developed; ovary glabrous. Fruit midseason; clusters medium in 
 length, compact, 11-17 berries, drooping; cluster-stems of average length and thickness; 
 berry-stems long, slender; berries cling well, roundish or somewhat oblate, medium to 
 large, variable in size, glossy, dark red; skin smooth, thin, tender, translucent; flesh firm, 
 moderately juicy, sprightly ; quality good. 

Franco-German, i. III. Hort. Soc. Rpt. 158. 1898. 2. Roesch Cat. 8. 1898. 

It is said by the introducer, Lewis Roesch, Fredonia, New York, that this variety was 
 originated by Lincoln Fay, Portland, New York, from seed of Fay, about 187 1. Mr. Fay 
 stated that he gave his seedling the name it bears because it originated diiring the Franco- 
 German war. Some writers are of the opinion that the variety is identical with Holland. 
 On the grounds of this Station, however, the plants have proved identical with Prince 
 Albert as other horticulturists have also discovered.
