Red Provence. 3. Horticulturist 2:266. 1847-48. 

This variety was originated by M. Gondouin, St. Cloud, France, nearly a century ago. 
 Both this and the white-fruited variety have frequently been designated as forming two 
 distinct groups of currants from which cultivated sorts have arisen. The variety has also 
 been confused with Victoria. From 1862 until 1871 the variety was included in the 
 American Pomological Society's recommended fruit list. Plants very vigorous, upright, 
 young shoots reddish ; bimches medium in size ; berries large, bright red ; late.

 sort of the same name. It was cataloged in the recommended list of the American 
 Pomological Society from 1862 to 1871 and again from 1897 to date. Plants vigorous, 
 upright, not always productive; bvmches of medium length, only partly filled; berries small 
 to mediimi, yellowish, briskly subacid; good; midseason.

 The origin of this variety is unknown. There seems to be little doubt, however, but 
 that it is a very old European currant. It has been known by many names most of which 
 have been directly connected with some characteristic of fruit-clusters or berries. As 
 grown at this Station the variety is very similar or identical with Prince Albert so that 
 a further description is unnecessary.

This variety originated on the farm of J. E. Shideler, Fairview Park, Indianapolis,
