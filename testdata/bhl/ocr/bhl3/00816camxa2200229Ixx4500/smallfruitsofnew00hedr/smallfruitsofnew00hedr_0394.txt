292 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

tiveness of plant. The clusters are large, uniform, and borne on a long stem so that picking 
 is easy. The berries are large, uniform, bright clear red, and are as pleasing in flavor as 
 those of any other variety and superior to those of most other currants. The fruit is borne 
 on the old wood in a manner peculiar to this sort alone. In Canada it is found to be one of 
 the hardiest of all currants. The canes have the fault of breaking rather easily. The 
 fruits scald considerably in hot weather if not picked as soon as ripe. This variety was 
 originated in 1887 by C. G. Hooker, Rochester, New York, as a cross between Fay and White 
 Grape. Its commercial introduction dates from 1902 and in 1909 the sort was placed in 
 the American Pomological Society's fruit list.

About 1873, George W. Blue found in a garden, near Fairview Park, Indianapolis, 
 Indiana, a variety which was then being grown as Knight Sweet Red but which he found 
 to be distinct. He named it Pomona after the name of his home farm. The variety was 
 introduced in 1896 by Albertson & Hobbs, Bridgeport, Indiana. In 1909 the American 
 Pomological Society added Pomona to its list of recommended fruits. Plants moderately 
 large, vigorous, spreading, productive; bunches long, well filled; berries of mediimi size, 
 bright red, juicy, mildly acid; good; midseason.
