294 "^^^ SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

To offset this fault they hang on the bushes well and are easily picked. The berries are 
 very mild in flavor and do not make a good jelly, for which purpose currants are so commonly 
 used. In many localities the bunches run small. This variety originated as a cross 
 between Cherry and White Grape by Jacob Moore, Attica, New York, in 1885, and first 
 fruited about 1889. The American Pomological Society added Red Cross to its fruit 
 catalog list in 1899. 

Plants large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense, productive, healthy; young shoots 
 numerous; leaf -buds large, medium long, pointed, rather plump, pubescent, free; leaves 
 of medium size, deeply cordate at the base, with shallow, obtuse lobes, medium in thick- 
 ness and color, dull, rugose, glabrous, with slightly hairy, crenate margins; petiole medium 
 in length and thickness, green, with slight tinge of red, pubescent. Flowers midseason, in 
 long, drooping racemes variable in compactness; calyx-tube pale green, saucer-shaped, 
 glabrous; caljTC-lobes obtuse, widely separated, pale green; ring fleshy, well defined; ovary 
 glabrous. Fruit midseason, hangs on the bushes well, easy to pick; clusters short to above 
 medium, the tips poorly filled, loose; cluster-stems long, slender to medium; berry-stems 
 long; berries medium to large, round, glossy, bright light red; skin smooth, thin, tender, 
 cracks under imfavorable conditions, translucent; flesh juicy, sprightly becoming mildly 
 flavored when fully ripe; quality good.

This old sort is now mainly of historical importance only, although it is to be found in 
 almost countless numbers in the gardens of the country. It is little grown in New York or 
 other parts of the East in commercial plantations, but is still somewhat largely grown in 
 the Middle West. The plants are nearly faultless, but the currants are small and ripen 
 ununiformly, to offset which they are of the very best quality. While there are many 
 synonyms, the true Red Dutch is easily identified from the description which follows. 
 This is one of the oldest if not the oldest cultivated currant known. The name has appeared 
 in print for more than two centuries, but no one can be quite certain that the Red Dutch 
 grown today is the Red Dutch of two centuries ago. It is somewhat difficult, also, to con- 
 nect Hollandische Rote of continental Europe with the Red Dutch now grown in England 
 and America. The currant, long grown in America under the name Fertile de Palnau, is 
 probably Red Dutch. The two have proved identical at this Station as well as in many 
 other localities here and abroad. Red Dutch was added to the American Pomological 
 Society's list of recommended fruits in 1852. 

Plants large, vigorous, upright, dense, productive to very productive, healthy; young 
 shoots very numerous, comparatively slender; leaf-buds sinall, pointed, lean, nearly gla- 
 brous, appressed; leaves medium in size, length, and thickness, subcordate to almost trun- 
 cate at the base, with short-pointed lobes, dull, dark green, glabrous, rugose, with crenate 
 margins; petiole medium in length and thickness, greenish, pubescent. Flowers early, 
 in fairly long, moderately loose, drooping, many-flowered racemes; calyx-tube greenish,
