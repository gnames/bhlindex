 Southwell Red. i. Garden 84:557, fig. 1920. 

Presiunably a variety of comparatively recent English origin. Described as one of 
 the most productive of English currants, blooming late, thereby escaping spring frosts and 
 producing a crop when many sorts fail. Besides these favorable attributes its fine appear-

At one time about the best of the currants grown in New York and the East, Versailles 
 has now given way to newer and better currants. The plants lack in productiveness and
