298 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Bunyard, in the reference given, is of the opinion that Raby Castle and Houghton Castle 
 or Victoria are distinct, the writers believe that they are identical. In 1852 the American 
 Pomological Society placed this variety in its list of recommended fruits under the name 
 May's Victoria, but later shortened the name to Victoria.

 ceptible to anthracnose but resistant to most other diseases; young shoots very numerous,
