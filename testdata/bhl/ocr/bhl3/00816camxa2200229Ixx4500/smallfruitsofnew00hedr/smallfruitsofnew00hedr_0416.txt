This variety may usually be told from other white currants by its darker color caused 
 from the large dark colored seeds showing through flesh and skin. Its currants are usually 
 rated as best in quality of all the white sorts. The rich, sweet flavor makes it a choice 
 dessert fruit, although the currants are not quite as attractive in appearance as those of some 
 other kinds. It is often confused with White Grape with which it has many characteristics 
 in common. The origin of this variety is unknown but it has long been known in America 
 and has repeatedly been confused with White Grape which it closely resembles except that 
 the berries are much sweeter. Its rather wide dissemination was due to the high recom- 
 mendation given it 30 years ago by the late S. D. Willard, Geneva, New York. 

Plants above medium in size and vigor, broad, spreading, open, productive; young 
 shoots numerous, slender; leaf -buds large, long, plump, pointed, pubescent, free; leaves large, 
 thin, rugose, dark green, lightly bronzed at first, with coarsely crenate to serrate margins; 
 petiole rather slender, green, lightly tinged with red. Flowers midseason, in short, dense, 
 drooping racemes; calyx-tube greenish, saucer-shaped, glabrous; calyx-lobes broadly obtuse, 
 separated but slightly, glabrous; ring greenish, fleshy; ovary glabrous. Fruit midseason; 
 clusters medium to long, the tips poorly filled, rather loose, 8-16 berries; cluster-stems 
 rather long, medium in thickness; berry-stems slender, medium long; berries somewhat 
 variable in size averaging medium to large, roundish, sometimes slightly ovate, creamy 
 white, a shade darker than White Grape; skin smooth, thin, tender; flesh firm, juicy, 
 pleasantly subacid to sweet; quality very good to best. 
 White Pearl, i. Mag. Hort. 17:217. 1851. 

This variety was raised by Remi Wilquet, near Brussels, Belgium, more than half a 
 century ago. Plants moderately vigorous, upright-spreading, unproductive; bunches 
 large, well filled; berries large, pale yellow, briskly subacid; good; midseason. 

White Provence, i. Rural N. Y. 10:255. i8S9- 

Plants very vigorous, productive; leaves large, thick, considerably edged with white; 
 bunches short; berries very large, yellowish white; good; not unlike White Grape except in 
 foliage.

This is an old French sort said to be a seedling of White Grape with which it is always 
 confused. It resembles that variety so closely that the two readily pass for one and a
