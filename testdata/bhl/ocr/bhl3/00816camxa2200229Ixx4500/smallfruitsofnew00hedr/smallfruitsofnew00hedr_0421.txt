Probably Wilder is now the leading commercial currant in the Hudson River Valley 
 and the Lake Erie grape belt where currants are most coinmonly grown for commercial 
 purposes in New York. It is a seedling of Versailles which it greatly surpasses in vigor 
 and productiveness and in the size and beauty of its fruits. The plants are very free from 
 insects and diseases and are most satisfactory in all characters. The fruits sometimes lack 
 uniformity in size of both berry and cluster, to offset which fault they have long stems, mak- 
 ing picking easy, and hang longer after ripening than those of most other commercial 
 varieties. Wilder is a seedling of Versailles and was originated by E. Y. Teas, Irvington, 
 Indiana, about 1877. It was named President Wilder in honor of Marshall P. Wilder, 
 noted horticulturist and former President of the American Pomological Society. This 
 Society added this currant to its list of recommended fruits in 1897.

 nose, productive to very productive; young shoots very numerous; leaf-buds very small, 
 short, pointed, glabrous, free, lightly tinged with brown; leaves large, dark green, with light 
 bluish tinge, thick, cordate at the base, with obtuse lobes, the notches between the lobes 
 frequently right-angled, with coarsely toothed or slightly crenate margins; petiole medium 
 in length and thickness, dark green, holding the leaves horizontally. Flowers early, in 
 long, loose, drooping, many-flowered clusters; calyx-tube greenish, with traces of red, deep 
 saucer-shaped, glabrous; calyx-lobes broadly obtuse, sharply reflexed at the apex giving a 
 pentagonal effect, light green; petals entire or notched; stamens with a broad connective 
 between the anther-cells; ring present, distinct, faintly colored at first becoming uncolored; 
 ovary glabrous. Fruit late midseason to late, hangs a long time after ripening; clusters 
 long, compact, the tips filled poorly; cluster-stems long, thick; berry-stems medium in
