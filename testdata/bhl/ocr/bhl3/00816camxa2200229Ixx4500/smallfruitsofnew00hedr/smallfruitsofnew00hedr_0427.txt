THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 305 

unpleasant flavor usually condemn it as a garden plant, but some like it, and since it suc- 
 ceeds in regions having hot summers, where most other currants fail, it is likely to be long 
 kept under cultivation. The berries ripen so unevenly that they must be picked singly, 
 which, of course, precludes its being a commercial plant. The bushes are usually unpro- 
 ductive, but a supposed productive strain is offered by some nurserjnnen. This currant 
 is supposed to have originated by R. W. Crandall, Newton, Kansas, many years ago, 
 from seed of a plant of a wild currant which he had found growing near his place. It was 
 introduced in 1888 by Frank Ford & Sons, Ravenna, Ohio. In 1899 the American Pomo- 
 logical Society added the variety to its list of recommended fruits. 

Plants of largest size, often 8 feet in height, very vigorous, upright, slightly spreading, 
 very dense, usually iinproductive but variable, healthy; young shoots light and dark brown, 
 glossy, pubescent, numerous; leaf -buds tomentose, small, short, obtuse, moderately 
 plump, appressed ; leaves small, truncate at the base, with deeply and irregularly cut lobes,

 margins and petiole, with coarsely dentate to deeply cut, serrate margins; petiole short, 
 slender, pubescent, light green. Flowers midseason, large, partly closed, golden yellow, 
 in short, dense, few-flowered, fragrant clusters; calyx-tube yellow, long-obconic, almost 
 cylindrical, glabrous; calyx-lobes oblong, medium in width and thickness, glabrous, yel- 
 lowish ; petals usually red- tipped, above medium in size, serrate ; ovary glabrous. Fruit very 
 late, period of ripening unusuall}' long; clusters very short, loose, 1-4 berries; cluster-stems 
 short, thick; berrj'-stems long, medium thick, pubescent; berries variable in size, small to
