308 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Possibly Naples is the most commonly grown black currant in America. Previous 
 to the law compelling the cutting out of black currants, it was more generally grown in 
 New York than any other kind. It does not, however, deserve its popularity, as the 
 clusters and berries are exceedingly variable in size, the clusters are usually small, the flavor 
 and aroma too pronounced to be pleasant, and the plants are not always productive. The 
 variety has a characteristic habit of bearing its buds on short clusters well distributed over 
 the canes. This is a European variety the origin of which is unknown. It was long a 
 standard in England where it was quite generally distributed more than a century ago. 
 It was brought to America early in the nineteenth century where it has been widely dis- 
 seminated. The variety was added to the fruit catalog list of the American Pomological 
 Society in 1852 under the name Black Naples. In the recent Society catalogs the name has 
 been shortened to Naples. 

Plants large, very vigorous, upright-spreading, very dense, -unproductive, healthy; 
 young shoots medium in number, the bark broken and netted irregularly and longitudi- 
 nally, showing darker brown beneath; leaf -buds tinged red, large, long, obtuse, plvrnip, 
 free; leaves large, cordate at the base, with short-pointed lobes, dull, light green, rugose,

 cast due to the pubescence present, in short, medium dense and drooping, few-flowered 
 clusters; calyx-tube greenish, sometimes with a slight red tinge, campanulate, heavily 
 pubescent, resinous; calyx-lobes oblong, medium in width and thickness, acute, pubescent, 
 with tinges of dull red; ovary resinous, pubescent. Fruit very late; clusters short, loose, 
 tips well filled; 4-8 berries; cluster-stems medium in thickness and length; berry-stems
