 Carman, i. Rural N. Y. 51:703. 1892. 2. StoiTs & Harrison Cat. 158, fig. 1905. 

Carman originated about 1890, with a Mr. Roberts, New York, New York, from seed 
 which had been imported from England. The new seedling attracted the attention of 
 E. S. Carman, editor of the Rural New-Yorker, who named and propagated it, and later, 
 through the columns of his paper, offered to furnish plants to those who desired them. 
 Soon after Storrs & Harrison, Painesville, Ohio procured the entire stock of Carman, 
 and introduced it in 1905. Plants small, weak, upright-spreading, not very healthy, 
 unproductive; fniit variable, mediiun to very small, roundish, dull yellowish green, 
 moderately juicy, firm, sprightly becoming subacid; good; midseason. 
 Carrie, i. U. S. D. A. Yearbook 379, PI. 33. 1909. 2. Hedrick Cyc. Hardy Fr. 307. 
 1922. 
 In the northern part of the Mississippi Valley where only the hardiest fruits can be 
 grown, Carrie is becoming a popular gooseberry because of its great hardiness. Plant and 
 fruit are very much like those of Houghton but distinct, and Carrie does not deserve a place 
 where the older sort grows well. The berries are too small, the plants are not quite free 
 from mildew, and the thorny bushes bother greatly in harvesting the crop. Carrie origi- 
 nated with Wjmian Elliot, Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1893, from seed of Houghton, sup- 
 posed to have been crossed with Industry'. The variety was introduced in 1905 by Elliot
