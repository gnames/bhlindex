Chautauqua, i. Am. Card. I5:iig, fig. i8g3-94. 2. .V. Y. Sta. Bid. 114:22, PI. 8, 
 fig. 61. i8g7. 
 Of all the European gooseberries grown in North America, Chautauqua is probably 
 the most promising, and as it grows in New York, at least, it is certainly the most deserving. 
 In plant and fruit Chautauqua is far superior to Houghton and Downing which nurser>Tnen 
 ind their agents keep constantly before growers of gooseberries. Chautauqua is less easily 
 propagated than the sorts named, and hence difficult to obtain. At this Station the plants 
 are almost free from the mildew which prevents the culture of the European gooseberries 
 in many parts of the United States. Its culture is of the easiest and anyone who grows the 
 comparatively worthless Houghton and Downing can as easily grow this admirable sort. 
 The origin of Chautauqua is unknown. The original plant, however, was first observed in
