326 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

an old garden in Dunkirk, New York, about 1876 by Lewis Roesch of Fredonia, who prop- 
 agated it, later naming and introducing it in 1S94. Charles Downing once saw the fruit 
 and was of the opinion that it was an English variety renamed. Several varieties resemble 
 it very closely but since the name Chautauqua has now become familiar, it seems wise 
 to consider it a distinct sort. On the Pacific Coast Chautauqua is said to be identical with 
 Whitesmith, where the latter name is always used. Chautauqua was added to the recom- 
 mended fruit list of the American Pomological Society in 1897.
