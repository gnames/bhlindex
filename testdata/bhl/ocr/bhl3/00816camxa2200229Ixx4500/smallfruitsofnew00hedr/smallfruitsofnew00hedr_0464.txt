With Chautauqua, Industry is usually considered the best of the European gooseberries 
 in America. It is one of the most vigorous varieties of its class; rather more productive 
 than any other European; and while by no means free from mildew, it often passes through 
 a season without much mildew, and when infested, the disease is usually readily controlled 
 by spraying. On our grounds the plants are very strong growers, and usually produce as 
 much fruit if not more than those of any other European variety. Many gooseberry 
 growers prefer to have plants from the nursery grown in bush form rather than in tree 
 form. The berries are large, claret-red, rich, sweet, and delicately piquant, and about the 
 best flavored of all the commonlj' grown gooseberries in American plantations. Very 
 often the berries are picked too soon; to be at their best they should be allowed to remain 
 on the plant until full maturity is reached. The chief defect of the variety for American 
 conditions is that it is difficult to propagate, and therefore scarcely obtainable from nursery- 
 men. Industry was raised by Robert Whinham early in the nineteenth century in northern 
 England. It was disseminated in this country by Ellwanger & Barry, Rochester, New York, 
 about 1885. The American Pomological Society added the variety to its fruit catalog 
 list in 1 89 1.
