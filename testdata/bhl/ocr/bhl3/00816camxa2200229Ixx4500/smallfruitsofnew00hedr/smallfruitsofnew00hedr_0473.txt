This old English sort has long been grown in America and is possibly among the half 
 dozen best European gooseberries for American conditions. The fnuts stand shipment 
 particularly well and are handsome in appearance and ver>^ good in flavor when permitted 
 to ripen completely. It is a favorable market sort wherever it succeeds. Perhaps its 
 most valuable characteristic, however, is that the plants are comparatively little troubled
