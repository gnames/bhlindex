This variety has attracted more attention from American gooseberry growers than 
 anj- other sort in this generation. It has very generally' received the approbation of pomolo- 
 gists because of the vigor and productiveness of the plants and the handsome appearance 
 and high quality of the fruits. It passes as an American sort, with few characters to indicate 
 European blood. The berries are much larger than those of any of the other American 
 varieties and are characterized by their oval shape and red color when ripe. The quality 
 is unsurpassed by that of any other gooseberry. The thorns are short and few and less 
 objectionable than in most American varieties. Another splendid character is that it is 
 easily propagated from cuttings, so that nurserymen should find it much more profitable 
 to grow than either the Houghton or Downing which they so commonly sell because of 
 easy propagation. The plants are so vigorous that they should be set farther apart in the 
 field than other varieties. Poorman originated about 1888 with William H. Craighead, 
 Brigham City, Utah, and was introduced in 1896 by D. S. Lohr, Tremonton, Utah. It 
 is supposed to be a cross between Houghton and Downing, and the bush and fruit would 
 indicate such parentage. In 1909 the American Pomological Society added Poorman to 
 its catalog list of fruits.
