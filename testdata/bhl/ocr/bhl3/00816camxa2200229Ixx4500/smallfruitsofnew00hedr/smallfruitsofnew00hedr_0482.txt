This variety is so similar to Chautauqua on the grounds of this Station that the two 
 have sometimes been thought identical. The variety, however, is described as distinct by 
 workers in the United States Department of Agriculture and by other pomologists so that 
 it is here held as distinct. A comparison of the descriptions of the two sorts shows some 
 slight differences. As yet the variety is little known among berry growers, but with its good 
 qualities ought to be generally planted. Portage originated as a chance seedling in 1874 
 with A. H. House, Mantua, Portage County, Ohio. It was propagated in a limited way 
 by George J. Streator, Garrettsville, Ohio, imtil about 1905 when nursery firms began 
 offering it for sale.
