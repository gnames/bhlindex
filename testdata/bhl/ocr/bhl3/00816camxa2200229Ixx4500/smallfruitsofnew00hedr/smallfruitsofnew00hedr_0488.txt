This old English sort is little grown in America but has so many good qualities for a 
 home plantation in which European gooseberries are wanted that it merits a place in this 
 text. The fruits are of but medium size and are rather dull in color and are rendered 
 somewhat less attractive by reason of stiff reddish hairs, but the quality is excellent and 
 the plants are satisfactory in nearly every respect. It merits notice also because of its 
 long and worthy past as an European variety under American conditions. Possibly no 
 other variety from across the seas has been grown longer or more widely in America than 
 Red Warrington. No information is available as to the origin of this variety except that it 
 is an old sort, probably first having been grown in England early in the last century. The 
 variety was probably brought to America nearly 100 years ago. The American Pomologi- 
 cal Society added the sort to its recommended list of fruits in 1852 where it appeared until 
 187 1 when it was dropped.

 acid skin; good; midseason.
