For many years this has been one of the standard European sorts grown in America. 
 It is very similar to Chautauqua and no doubt the two are often confused. The vigor and 
 productiveness of the plants and the beauty and high quality of the fruits both recommend 
 it. The original plant of this variety was found in England more than a century ago. 
 The sort was early brought to America where it was once grown rather extensively. As 
 distributed at present by most American nurserjTnen, the variety is identical with or closely 
 resembles Chautauqua. The American Pomological Society added the variety to its fruit 
 list in 1897. 

Plants large, vigorous, upright-spreading, dense, very productive, healthy; young 
 shoots mediimi in stockiness, numerous, dark reddish brown scantily overspread with gray 
 scarf-skin; prickles mediiun in thickness, strong, short, 1-3, more often single, interspersed 
 with bristles between the nodes toward the base of the canes; leaf-buds large, long, conical, 
 moderately plump, semi-free; leaves medium in size, thickness and color, cordate, with 
 obovate lobes, rugose; with hairy, crenate margins; petiole mediiun in length, slender, green- 
 ish, pubescent, glandular at the base. Flowers early, medium in size, single ; pedicels medium 
 in length and thickness, pubescent; calyx-lobes medium in length, width and thickness, 
 pubescent, dull red; ovary heavily pubescent. Fruit midseason, adheres well; variable in 
 size, averaging large, roundish oval to long-oval, light silvery green mingled with a faint 
 tinge of yellow at full maturity ; skin smooth, glaucous, mediimi in thickness, tough, trans- 
 lucent; flesh pale green, juicy, firm, mild and sweet when fully ripe, but with considerable 
 sprightliness next to the skin; quality good to very good. 

Westennan Favorite, i. Card. Moit. 11:271. 1869. 

A seedling of an English gooseberry raised more than fifty years ago at Sharon, 
 Pennsylvania. Fruit very large; considered equal to any English variety. 

White Eagle, i. Mag. Hort. 1:207. 1835. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 114:32. 1897. 

Eagle. 3. Hogg Fruit Mail. 126. 1866. 

Cook's White Eagle. 4. Downing Fr. Trees Am. 503. 1869. 

Several characters of White Eagle make it desirable in plantations of European goose- 
 berries in this country. Thus, it is about the latest of all the European varieties ; the fruits 
 while variable in size are very large and attract attention because of their pear shape and 
 yellow color at maturity. The berries are sweet at full maturity and while not of the best 
 are very good in quality. The bush makes only a moderate growth, but usually mildews 
 but little. There seems to be no trace of the place or time of origin of this gooseberry. 
 Presumably the original plants were introduced to this country from England, and the 
 variety has been growing in American gardens for nearly a century. 

Plants above medium in height and vigor, upright-spreading, dense, productive, 
 healthy; young shoots meditun in stockiness and number, smooth becoming roughish with 
 age, reddish brown overlaid with dull gray scarf-skin; prickles of medium thickness, length 
 and number, often in twos and threes, interspersed with but few bristles; leaf -buds medium
