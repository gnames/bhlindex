In some parts of the United States and Canada Whitesmith is considered the best of 
 the English varieties grown on this side of the Atlantic. The plants are very large and 
 vigorous and are usually productive. The fruit ripens early, and while not of the largest, 
 is above mediimi in size and is particularly good in quahty, the flesh being juicy, tender and 
 very pleasantlj- flavored. Unfortunately the plants usually mildew rather severely. 
 This is an old English variety, the date and place of origin of which is unknown. It was 
 grown in England, however, in 1802, when William Forsyth spoke of it as one of the newer 
 sorts. The variety has long been known in the United States. In 1852 the American 
 Pomological Society added the sort to its fruit catalog list, a place it still retains, the name 
 having long since been shortened to Whitesmith. 

Plants above medium in size, vigorous, upright-spreading, somewhat open, productive; 
 young shoots medium in thickness and number, reddish brown overlaid with gray scarf- 
 skin; prickles slender, strong, medium in length, usually in ones; leaf -buds large, long, 
 obtuse, plump, semi-free; leaves medium in size, thickness and color, cordate, with obovate, 
 shallowly cut lobes, glossy, rugose, with hairy, crenate to nearly serrate margins; petiole 
 short, medium in thickness, green, pubescent, with few glands. Flowers early, medium in 
 size, usually single; pedicels medium in length and thickness, pubescent; calj^c-tube green, 
 pubescent; calyx-lobes medium in length, width and thickness, pubescent beneath, tinged 
 dull red; ovary with short, heavy pubescence, eglandular. Fruit early, above medium in 
 size, roundish oval, light silvery green, with faint tinge of yellow at full maturity; skin 
 smooth, glaucous, thin, tender; flesh light green, juicy, firm but tender, pleasantly flavored, 
 sweet; quality good.
