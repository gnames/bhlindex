THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 36 1 

1624. From France, in turn, it was taken to England where it seems to 
 have immediately found favor for it was soon widely cultivated by the 
 English who made importations of both seeds and plants from the United 
 States and Canada. In time it became an escape from cultivation, and 
 undoubtedly hybrids arose in both gardens and the wild in many parts of 
 Europe. 

The berries of the Virginian strawberry are handsome in color and 
 form and delicious in taste and aroma but run small and no art of the culti- 
 vator seems to increase their size. For more than a hundred years only the 
 wild form could be found in English gardens despite the widely different 
 environment under which it must have been grown both there and on the 
 continent. Like the European species it seemed incapable of great varia- 
 tion. Two himdred years after its introduction in Europe, and after wide- 
 spread cultivation in Great Britain, but twenty-six named sorts were listed 
 by Barnet, writing for the Transactions of the London Horticultural Society 
 in T824. 

A few varieties of the Virginian are still grown in England, chiefly for 
 jam, and in the list of varieties described in this text as American sorts 
 perhaps a score are pure-bred offspring of Fragaria virginiana. As a hybrid, 
 as we shall see, it probably plays a very important part. 

The several botanical varieties described in Chapter XV vary con- 
 siderably in their value in the garden ; therefore for use in attempts at 
 amelioration or for plant breeding. Unfortunately these comparative 
 values are not yet as well determined as might be wished. 

THE CHILEAN STRAWBERRY 

The most conspicuous landmark in the domestication of the straw- 
 berry is the introduction of the Chilean, Fragaria chiloensis, in Europe early 
 in the eighteenth century. This species, as will be set forth in the dis- 
 cussion of its botany, is a native of western South and North America in 
 the mountain ranges near the coast and might perhaps better be called 
 the Pacific strawberry. It was taken from Chile to France in 171 2 by a 
 Captain Frezier, thence to England at least as early as 1727. 

Little seems to have come from the Chilean strawberry for a hundred 
 years after its introduction into Europe and then its rapid amelioration 
 became one of the most remarkable phenomena recorded in pomology. 
 Within a half century after this marked improvement began, as indicated by 
 the introduction of many new and better varieties, the cultivation of all
