262 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Other species had practically ceased, and the strawberry in North America 
 and Europe had passed from a minor to a major fruit in the two continents. 

There has been much speculation as to what the stimulus or stimtili 
 were that started the strawberry on this unwonted career of improvement. 
 Perhaps no other fruit has had more careful and diligent study as to origin 
 and the means employed to bring plant and product to present perfection 
 than the strawberry. Beginning with Duchesne in 1766 down to the present 
 time, one or more men well trained in botany and pomology have searched 
 the records and studied wild and cultivated plants of this fruit to determine 
 its origin, the means of amelioration, and in particular the stimuli that started 
 it, a hundred years ago, to produce larger and better-flavored fruits. 

Space does not admit of a detailed review of the work of these straw- 
 berry students since the results as published run into several monographs 
 and many technical papers. Perhaps what has been learned in the extended 
 and excellent studies of the origin of this fruit may be best summarized 
 by quoting from the four men who have last given the evolution of the 
 strawberry studious attention with the view of determining how the large- 
 fruited strawberries came into existence. 

Sturtevant believed that the modem strawberry is derived through 
 hybridization of two European and two American species. He ' summarizes 
 his belief as follows: 

" The modern varieties vinder American culture have usually large 
 berries with more or less sunken seeds, with the trusses lower than the 
 leaves, and seem to belong mostly to the species represented in natiu-e by 
 Fragaria Virginiana, although there are supposed hybridizations with 
 Fragaria Chiloensis, and, in the higher flavored class, with Fragaria elatior. 
 Certain it is that in growing seedlings from our improved varieties reversions 
 often occur to varieties referable to the Hautbois and Chilian sorts, from 
 which hybridization can be inferred. I have noted as of common occur- 
 rence that seedlings from high-flavored varieties are very likely to furnish 
 some plants of the Hautbois class, and even scarcely, if at all, distinguishable 
 from named varieties of the Hautbois with which there has been opportunity 
 for close comparison. From large berried varieties of diminished flavor, 
 and which occasionally throw hollowed berries, the reversion occasionally 
 produces plants unmistakably of the Chilian type. In other cases we have 
 noticed reversions to forms of Fragaria vesca. These circumstances all 
 lead towards establishing the mingled parentage of our varieties under 
 cultivation, and render the classification of cultivated varieties somewhat 
 difficult."
