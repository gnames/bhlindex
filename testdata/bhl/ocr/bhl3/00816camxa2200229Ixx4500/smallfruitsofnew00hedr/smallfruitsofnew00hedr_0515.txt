THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 365 

Every one of these kinds that has attained prominence in garden or field 
 seems to show the characters of the two great American wild species. They 
 seem to the workers at this Station to be unmistakably hybrids with no 
 pure-breds. 

Perhaps another statement of opinion may be submitted even if it has 
 little value as definite proof. These cultivated varieties and seedlings 
 fruiting on our grounds this season, and in the past, as plantations of other 
 seasons have been kept in mind or can be brought to mind by looking over 
 descriptions of other seasons, seem to show that F. inrginiana greatly pre- 
 dominates over F. chiloensis in these North American strawberries, — a 
 hypothesis that Fletcher has ably defended in his The Strawberry in North 
 America. 

We leave this discussion of F. chiloejisis, the introduction of which in 
 Europe seems to mark the beginning of the modem development of the 
 strawberry, with the statement that: Evidence now seems to show that 
 the modem garden strawberry of North America and Europe is a hybrid 
 between F. virginiana and F. chiloensis. 

THE STRAWBERRY IN NORTH AMERICA 

Thestrawberry is preeminently an American fruit by reason of extensive 
 cultivation and use as well as because of the nativity of the species which 
 have given the world most of its cultivated varieties. In extent of acreage, 
 quantity produced, value of crop, and number of cultivated varieties, the 
 strawberry exceeds all of the other small fruits together in the United States 
 and ranks high among tree fruits. This great strawberry industry is a 
 development of the last hundred years, — almost a matter within the memory 
 of men still living. In the history of the industry, the conspicuous land- 
 marks are easily pointed out. 

Early settlers found wild strawberries in luxurious abundance in almost 
 every part of North America. It has ever been and still is the fruit of 
 fruits for the pioneer. The plentifulness of wild berries makes cviltivation 
 vmnecessary until agriculture has taken possession of a region. This seems 
 not to have happened in any part of North America until just before the 
 Revolution, although it may be surmised that thrifty housewives brought 
 in superior plants from the fields to grow in the garden long before. Wild 
 strawberries were freely sold in all American towns, however, as early as 
 1700. But the first landmark in American strawberry culture appears in 
 1 77 1 when varieties for sale were offered in a trade catalog.
