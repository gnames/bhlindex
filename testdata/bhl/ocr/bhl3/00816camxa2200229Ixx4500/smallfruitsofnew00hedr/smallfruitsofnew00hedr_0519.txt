inspired experimental work in pollination, and after a decade of discussion 
 from 1840 to 1850 in the press and in all American pomological societies, 
 it was established that some varieties of strawberries were hermaphrodites 
 and others unisexual, and that pistillate sorts must be cross-pollinated to 
 bear fruit. With this knowledge, strawberry growing passed the trouble- 
 some obstacle of unproductiveness from self-sterility and the industry was 
 given another forward impetus. 

The Hovey was the first notable variety in the present race of large- 
 fruited strawberries in America, and perhaps the brief account of its intro- 
 duction and its influence on strawberry culture in the country may be put 
 down as the last important landmark needful in this sketch of the straw- 
 berry in North America. It remains now to show the present magnitude 
 of strawberry growing in the United States. Table 4 gives this information.
