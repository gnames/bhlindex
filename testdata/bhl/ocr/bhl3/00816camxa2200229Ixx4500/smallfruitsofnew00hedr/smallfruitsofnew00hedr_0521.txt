THE SYSTEMATIC BOTANY OF THE STRAWBERRY 

Strawberries form part of the Rose family, Rosaceae; they are closely 
 allied to Potentilla, from which they chiefly differ in the receptacle of the 
 flower becoming fleshy and edible. They are low, perennial herbs, and 
 propagate easily by runners and seeds. They chiefly inhabit the temperate 
 regions of the Northern Hemisphere, and on the American continent follow 
 the long moimtain chains from Alaska to southern Chile. In the North 
 they are common from the plains to the mountains on dry hillsides, among 
 bushes and in woods, rarely in meadows. In warmer countries they are 
 restricted to the mountain regions. The number of species is still disputed. 
 While the number of specific names given by various botanists to wild 
 specimens of Fragaria surpasses 150, others like Bentham & Hooker, and 
 Focke, only recognize about 8 species. Probably there are more than 8 
 species, but just how many can be distinguished without dispute cannot 
 be said. 

The difficulty is that strawberries are much alike and possess scarcely 
 any distinguishing specific characters. Characters on which most specific 
 descriptions rely, as size of leaves, petioles, peduncles, hairiness, and the 
 shape and dentation of the leaflets, are exceedingly variable. Most species 
 have a wide geographical range with few or many natural varieties. 
 Besides this variation spontaneous hybrids are known and expected to exist 
 wherever two or more species come in contact. It is therefore not always 
 easy to decide to which species a given wild strawberry belongs or where 
 the limits of a species shoiild be drawn. 

In the North American Flora 2"] species are described as inhabiting 
 North America inclusive of Mexico and Jamaica. However, several of 
 these have little claim as species and are scarcely more than varieties, and 
 one is a garden hybrid. All of the North American strawberries have edible 
 fruits and some may help to meet local climatic requirements when used in 
 breeding work. The Old World species have been cultivated for a long 
 time. At present they have only historical interest as they are totally 
 eclipsed by the large-fruited varieties resulting from 2 species of the New 
 World, one from Chile {F. chiloensis) and one from the United States and 
 Canada {F. i^irginiana). 

Sex is of great importance to the grower. Some flowers are hermaphro- 
 dite, that is, they have both fertile stamens and pistils; in other cases one
