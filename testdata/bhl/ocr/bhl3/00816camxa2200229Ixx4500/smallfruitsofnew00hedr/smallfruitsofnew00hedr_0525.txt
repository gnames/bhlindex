 teeth on the inner and 5-10 on the outer side. Scape generally overtopping the leaves, with 
 soft, spreading or appressed hairs, racemosely and usually unilaterally branched; pedicels 
 unequal, the lowest longer than the other with spreading hairs, the upper one with appressed 
 or erect white hairs, all elegantly curved when in fruit; bracts ovate or subulate; the lower
