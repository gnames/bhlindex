2^6 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

been no cultivated forms of the common wood strawberry besides the 
 httle varied F. petite hdtive, which ripened five to six days earUer. Most 
 of these plants are out of common cultivation and all are replaced by the 
 modern large-fruited varieties. 

Hybrids between F. vesca and F. chiloensis have been observed 
 repeatedly in gardens, in Europe as well as elsewhere. Such hybrids 
 were also collected in Ecuador at Ambato by Wilson Popenoe in January, 
 1 92 1. These hybrids are either more like F. vesca or more like F. chiloensis, 
 but in all their characters they clearly show their hybrid nature. Hybrids 
 of F. vesca with F. virginiana are also reported to occur occasionally in Euro- 
 pean gardens, and probably also such with the F. chiloensis x F. virginiana.

Larger than F. vesca, 15-30 cm high. Rhizome stout, stipules brown, keeled, rather 
 short. Petioles erect, narrowly channeled, up to 20 cm long and rather slender, with strong 
 spreading hairs. Leaflets about equally stalked, almost uniform in shape, rhomboid- 
 ovate, somewhat pointed, the terminal one with a broadly cuneate base, the lateral ones 
 with an oblique roundish cuneate base; soft, plicate, bright green with scattered hairs, paler 
 and hairier underneath, 3-7 cm long and 2-5 cm wide; teeth coarse, ovoid-deltoid, 9-14 
 on each side, the terminal tooth often prominent, though small, lateral leaflets with a 
 few more teeth on the outer margins. Scape mostlj- longer than the petioles, with spreading 
 hairs, usually with a foliaceous bract at the lowest forking with 5-12 flowers; pedicels with 
 spreading hairs, erect, simple or forked, almost of equal length forming a rather rich sub- 
 cymose inflorescence. Flowers dioecious, slightly fragrant, the male ones larger with 
 slender pedicels, the female ones smaller. Outer calyx-lobes narrowly lanceolate, contracted 
 at the base, long acimiinate; inner calyx-lobes longer, deltoid-lanceolate, long acuminate, 
 variable in length, sometimes exceeding the petals. Petals roundish obovate, white or 
 yellowish. Stamens about 20 in the male plants, longer than the receptacle, in the female 
 plants fewer and as long or shorter than the receptacle. Fruit with spreading or reflexed 
 calyx-lobes, roundish or roundish ovoid, often with a short neck and rather large, sweet and 
 agreeable with a slight musky flavor. 

Central Europe to England and south Sweden, Finland and probably 
 Russia; in shady woods, on hills. 

This species is easily distinguished from F. vesca by size of plant and 
 the almost umbellate flowers. There is a forma rubriflora, Heimerl Abhandl.
