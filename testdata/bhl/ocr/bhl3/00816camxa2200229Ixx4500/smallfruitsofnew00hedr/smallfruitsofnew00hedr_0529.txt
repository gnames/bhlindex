THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 377 

Z. B. G. Wien 31:176. 1881, with crimson or striped petals. A forma 
 calycina Loisel Fl. gall. 299. 1868, has large foliaceous calyx-lobes. 

Hybrid forms are recorded with F. vesca. They are taller than the 
 parents, and have the pedicels with variously mixed appressed, erect, and 
 spreading hairs. The calyx-lobes on the ripe fruit are spreading. Such 
 hybrids have been named F. intermedia, Bach Flora 24:719. 1841 and 
 F. dryviopJiila, Jord. & Fourr. Icon. PI. 28, fig. 48. 1870. Hybrids with 
 F. viridis are also recorded. They are usually found among the parents, 
 but are easily overlooked. Here belong F. neglecta, Lindem. Bui. Soc. 
 Imp. Mosc. 38:Pt. II, 218. 1865 and F. sericea, Christ Nym. Consp. Suppl. 
 109. 1890; not Douglas. Hybrids with F. chiloensis are said to occur 
 occasionally in European gardens. 

On account of its delectable, aromatic fruits it has been long under 
 cultivation as the Hautbois Strawberry, Moschuserdbeere, Zimmeterdbeere, 
 or Capron, but these have given way to larger fruited kinds. Near Ham- 
 burg it is still cultivated as Vierlander Erdbeere or Liitte Diitsche. The 
 objection to this strawberry has always been that it is not productive on 
 account of the male plants, which were generally eradicated by the culti- 
 vators. Duchesne was the first to show the dioecious flowers of this 
 species and the necessity to preserve some male plants in cultivation.

Rhizome little branched; stipules narrow; petioles with spreading hairs. Leaflets 
 ovate, obtuse, deep green, almost metallic green, glaucescent underneath, on both sides, 
 especially beneath densely covered with appressed silkj' hairs; lateral leaflets sessile, termi- 
 nal one shortly stalked; lateral teeth curved, converging over the smaller terminal one. 
 Scape slender, but stiffs and erect, with spreading hairs below and with appressed or erect 
 hairs above; inflorescence about 4-flowered, more or less hidden among the foliage, with 
 short intemodes and prolonged pedicels, subumbellate, with appressed silky hairs. Flowers 
 incompletely dioecious, yellowish or greenish yellow when opening, finally white; calyx- 
 lobes equally long, outer ones spreading. Petals rather flat, undulate at the margins. 
 Stamens in fertile flowers as long as the receptacle, twice as long in the sterile ones. Fruit 
 globular, with a seedless neck, rather large, with the achenes sunk in pits, red but white 
 under the adpressed calyx-lobes, firmly attached and incompletely detaching, rather hard, 
 but aromatic, about as large as that of F. vesca.
