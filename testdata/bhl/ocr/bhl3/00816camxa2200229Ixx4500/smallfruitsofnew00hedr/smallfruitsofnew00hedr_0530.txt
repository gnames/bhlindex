378 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Central Europe and northern Asia; not as common as the others and 
 preferably on calcareous soil. 

This species is a most variable plant. The following varieties and 
 forms are recorded: F. viridis var. alpina, Ascherson & Graebener Syn. 
 Mitteleurop. Ft. 6:655. 1904. A very dwarf, densely hairy plant; occurs on 
 dry rocks in Transsylvania. Ascherson & Graebener further mention a 
 forma flagellifera with long runners; a forma subpinnata with two smaller, 
 adventive leaflets; a forma magnusiana with five leaflets; and a forma 
 subphinatisecta, with deeply toothed or cut leaves. 

Probably hybrids between F. viridis and F. vesca are described as 
 F. majaufea, Duchesne in Lamarck Encycl. 2 : 533. 1786; F. Hagcfibachiana , 
 Lange ex Koch Flora 25:532. 1842. It is a robust plant with stalked leaf- 
 lets, the petiolule of the terminal leaflet often more than i cm. long. To 
 this form may belong also F. hi f era, Duchesne in Lamarck Encycl. 2:533. 
 1786, said to flower repeatedly, and F. dnbia, Duchesne I.e., with poor, often 
 abortive fruits. F. iimbelliformis, Schultz ex Nyman Conspect. 222. 1878, 
 is probably a similar hybrid form. The influence of F. viridis is recog- 
 nizable from the silky hairs on the under side of the leaves. 

F. viridis is now hardly anywhere in cultivation, but it was grown to 
 some extent in Europe at the end of the eighteenth century and later. It 
 was known in France under the names Capiton, Breslinge, Craquelin, 
 Fraisier etoile, Breslinge de Bourgogne, Fraisier marteau, Fraisier vert, and 
 Breslinge d'Angleterre. It is described and figixred by Duhamel, Trait. 
 Arb. Fr. 1:252, PI. IX. 1768, under the name F. gracilis flore et fructibus 
 suhviridibiis. The designation Breslinge is derived from the South German 
 word Prestling (Brestling), which is applied to all cultivated strawberries. 

Fragaria chiloensis Linn. Duchesne Hist. Nat. Frais. 165. 1766; Ehrhart Beitr. 
 7:1792; Decaisne 7a?-(f . Fruit. 9:53, PI. 1862-75; Ascherson & Graebener Sj'm. Mitteleurop.

Chilean Strawberry. â€” Rootstock stout ; stipioles densely felty, brown, scarious. 
 Petioles stout, 5-20 cm long, very densely hirsute with patent gray or whitish hairs. Leaf 
 lets about equal, 2-5 cm long, somewhat falted along the midrib, more or less stalked, 
 especially the terminal one, thick, leathery, smooth and shining dark green above with 
 deeply impressed veins, underneath strongly reticulate with prominent nerves and almost 
 white from densely adpressed, silk>' hairs; crenate dentate, teeth short roundish, with 
 revolute hairy margins, terminal tooth minute; lateral leaflets obliquely roundish with an 
 oblique, entire, broadly cuneate base, especially on the inner side, with about 7-9 teeth 
 on each side; terminal leaflet stalked, twice as long, roundish or obovate roundish, with
