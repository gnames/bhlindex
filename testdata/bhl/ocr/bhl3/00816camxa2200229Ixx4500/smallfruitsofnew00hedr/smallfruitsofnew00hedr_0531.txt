THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 379 

an entire, broadly cuneate base, teeth about 7 on each side. Scape shorter than the leaves, 
 with many spreading hairs, like the petioles, rather few flowered; bracts verj- hairy, densely 
 covered with almost adpressed silky hairs. Flowers dioecious or polygamous, rarely her- 
 maphrodite, the male flowers larger. Calyx very densely silky hairy, lobes narrowed above 
 the base, the outer ones shorter. Petals 6-8, round, with undulate margins, suddenly 
 contracted into a claw, longer than the calyx; receptacle hair>', stamens in the male 
 flowers many. Fruit dull red, ovoid conical, large, over 3 cm long, hairy between the 
 slightly sunken achenes, borne on a recurved or â€” formed pedicel, caljTc-lobes loosely 
 adpressed. 

Chile, Peru, Ecuador, and there largely cultivated everywhere under 
 the name Frutilla. An interesting account of its cultivation in South 
 America is given by Wilson Popenoe, I.e. It is said to grow in California. 
 The Chilean strawberry was first introduced into France in 17 12 by a French 
 officer named Frezier. 

A form with two smaller leaflets below the normal leaflets was named 
 var. pentaphylla, Schur E7ium. Plant. Transs. 187. 1866, but such leaves 
 are frequently found. 

The first introduced plants of F. chiloensis were pistillate-flowering and 
 consequently unproductive for want of pollination. Pollination, however, 
 took place where the plants were grown in the vicinity of F. mrginiana. 
 From seeds resulting from such crosses were produced towards the middle of 
 the eighteenth century the varieties known as Pine or Ananas, Bath, and 
 others. They were described under the following names: F. ananassa, 
 Duchesne Hist. Nat. Frais. 190. 1766; F. vesca ananassa, Aiton Hort. 
 Kew. 2:212. 1789; F. grandiflora, Ehrhart Beitr. 7:25. 1792, and F. 
 calycina, Mill. Icon. PL 288. 1794. The variety Bath was named F. calv- 
 culata by Duchesne in Lamarck Encyc. 2:538. 1786; a similar variety, 
 Caroline, was named F. carolinensis, and another, F. tincta, by Duchesne 
 in Lamarck Encyc. 2:539. 1786. 

Evidently different strains and varieties of F. virginiana must have 
 partaken in these crosses, and from these came all of our modem large- 
 fruited strawberries. Some of these varieties lean to one parent, some to 
 the other, but most of them are intermediate forms. The stronger influence 
 of F. chiloensis is usually visible in the more leathery shining green flat 
 leaflets with a more reticulate venation, roimdish teeth, and greater hairi- 
 ness on petioles and peduncles. Examples are the varieties Alden, Arcade 
 Aurora, Bliss, Howard, Parker, Schauber, and Wyona. 

Those kinds which lean more towards F. virginiana have thinner, 
 more glaucous leaflets, which are more or less felted along the midrib,
