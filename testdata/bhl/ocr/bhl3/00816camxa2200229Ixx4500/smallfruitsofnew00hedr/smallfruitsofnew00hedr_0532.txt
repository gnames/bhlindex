380 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

with coarser, more falcate teeth and less visible reticulate venation. 
 Varieties of this kind are Abington, Beder Wood, Champion, Chesapeake, 
 Delicious, Dunlap, Easypicker, Eaton, Haverland, and Klondike. 

As a rule, however, the characters of F. virginiana seem to be more 
 dominant ; this is also evident in the long petioles and scapes and the more 
 cymose, many-flowered inflorescences, the brighter color, and the sunken 
 seeds of the fruits. 

L. H. Bailey puts all of these hybrids under F. chiloensis ananassa 
 Hort., in his Stand. Cyc. Hort. 3:1272. 1915. Duchesne created for them 
 and for F. virginiana the group name Quoimio which, however, never came 
 into general use. A form with variegated leaves has been recorded and also 
 one with persistent petals. Hybrids with F. vesca and with F. moschata 
 occur and have been mentioned imder these species.

Rootstock stout, stipules large and broad, ovoid, pointed, brown, the lower ones 
 more hairy; runners stout and long, with adpressed hairs. Petioles 3-9 cm long, stout, 
 not channeled above, densely beset with soft, spreading, white hairs. Leaflets rather small, 
 somewhat thick or sometimes nearly coriaceous, glabrous and dark shining green above 
 with deeply impressed venation, whitish tomentose and with long silky hairs, especially 
 along the elevated veins underneath, 2-5 cm long and 1.5-4 cm wide, obtuse or truncate 
 with the terminal tooth very small; the lateral leaflets on very short stalks, very obliquely 
 cuneate at the base, rhomboid-ovate, the outer side larger almost aimculate with 5-8 teeth, 
 the inner side with about 2-3 teeth or more; the terminal leaflet longer stalked, obovate- 
 cuneate or almost obcordate, crenate only at the top with 2-5 teeth on each side; the teeth 
 broadly roundish, abruptly pointed, overtopped by a brush of silky hairs. Scapes mostly 
 shorter than the petioles, with spreading hairs; bracts sometimes foliaceous; pedicels 2-5 
 cm long, with spreading or adpressed or reflexed hairs. Flowers several, polygamo-dioe- 
 cious, male flowers larger, over 3 cm across, the female ones much smaller, soon losing their 
 petals. Calyx with adpressed white silky hairs, outer calyx-lobes oblanceolate, with a 
 midrib and reticulate veins, inner ones broader and longer, ovate-deltoid, acute. Petals 
 roundish obovate, with a short claw. Receptacle hairy. Fruit small, roundish, softly 
 hairy, dull red, sweet, achenes brown in pits; calyx spreading, peduncle recurved or 
 ■^ -shaped, bearing the fruit upright.
