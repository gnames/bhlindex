THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 381 

sandbinder and consequently a hummock former. The large globose 
 fruit with achenes in pits begin to ripen in May." (C. F. Baker.) 

This small and pretty little strawberry is related to 7^. chiloensis, but dif- 
 fers sufficiently from that species. It has been largely used in hybridizing 
 with the common large-fruited garden strawberries by Albert F. Etter, in 
 Ettersburg, California. His varieties Ettersburg No. 432 and No. 433 
 show this deri-^-ation clearly. At the Alaska Agricultural Experiment 
 Station, Sitka, C. C. Gaorgason also raised a number of varieties suitable 
 to the Alaskan climate from this species crossed with an unnamed garden 
 variety. 

Fragaria cuneifolia. Nuttall ex Rydberg N. Am. Fl. 22:360. 1908. 

Rootstock short, not very thick; stipules brow-n, lanceolate. Runners long and slender 
 with spreading hairs. Petioles slender, broadly channeled, with long, silky, spreading or 
 reflexed hairs. Leaflets rather firm, almost coriaceous, glaucous green and glabrous above; 
 pale green and slightly tomentose and with long, silky hairs underneath, cuneate-obovate, 
 obtuse or truncate, 1.5-4 cm long, with a few teeth only near the apex, the middle 
 tooth smaller; terminal leaflet stalked, the lateral ones shorter stalked or subsessile, not 
 much oblique. Scape slender, shorter than the leaves, with spreading or reflexed long hairs ; 
 pedicels few, slender, with loosely adpressed hairs. Flowers dioecious, 1.5-2 cm wide; 
 outer and inner calyx-lobes linear-lanceolate; petals obovate-cuneate. Fruit subglobose, 
 pink or light red, about i cm across, very hairy, with the achenes in pits. 

British Columbia to Oregon and Idaho. This species has been likewise 
 employed in breeding work by Etter in California. 

Fragaria platypetala. Rydberg Mem. Dept. Boi. Columbia Univ. 2:177. 1898; 
 Rydberg X. Am. Fl. 22:361. 1908. 

Stipules rather small; petioles 2-20 cm long, narrowly channeled, with white spreading 
 hairs. Leaflets soft, glabrous and dull pale green or somewhat shining when yoimg, paler 
 beneath and silky hairy along the veins and the margins, stalked, obovate-cuneate obtuse 
 on each side with about 8-10 sharp ovate curved teeth, the terminal tooth minute; the 
 lateral leaflets not very oblique, the terminal one longer stalked. Scape almost as long as 
 the petioles or shorter, with spreading silky hairs, rather many flowered. Flowers 1.5-2.5 
 cm across, calyx-lobes lanceolate; petals orbicular. Fruit small, 1-1.5 cm across, achenes 
 sunk in shallow pits. 

From Alaska to California, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana. This 
 species has been used for hybridizing at the Alaska Agricultural Experiment 
 Station.
