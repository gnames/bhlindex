382 THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Scarlet or Virginia Strawberry.â€” Rootstock moderately stout, short; stipules long 
 pointed, more or less tinged with bright crimson, along the keel and margin with stiff long 
 white hairs. Runners long and rather stout with appressed hairs. Petioles rather stout 
 and long, reaching up to 25-30 cm, broadly channeled above, more or less hairy, especially 
 near the top, hairs spreading or adpressed, scattered, the strong old leaf-stalks densely 
 beset with spreading hairs. Leaflets from almost sessile to distinctly stalked, rather 
 firm in texture, more or less falted along the midrib, usually intensely glaucous green, paler 
 underneath, silky hairy when young, almost glabrous when old or with scattered adpressed 
 hairs on both sides, chiefly underneath along the veins, and along the margins, often over- 
 topping the pointed lanceolate or ovoid-deltoid, frequently curved teeth, the terminal tooth 
 smaller; terminal leaflet obovate-cuneate, obtuse, entire in the lower third or half, 3-10 
 cm long and 3-6 cm wide, with 7-10 well-formed teeth on each side; lateral leaflets obliquely 
 obovate or rhomboid-ovate, obtuse, the inner side narrower and with a longer entire base, 
 the outer side broader and with 6-12 larger teeth. Scape mostly as long as the petioles, 
 but sometimes shorter, with loosely adpressed hairs; inflorescence c\-mosely vtmbellate, 
 5-13 flowered or more, with lanceolate-acute or foliaceous or even 3-foliolate bracts; pedicels 
 short and erect at first, scarcely exceeding the bracts, but soon elongating and curving 
 afterwards, covered with long adpressed gray, not silky, hairs. Flowers polygamo-dioe- 
 cious, 2-2.5 cm across, the pistillate flowers usually smaller. Calyx with long adpressed 
 or reflexed gray hairs, outei lobes narrowly lanceolate, inner calyx-lobes broader, deltoid- 
 lanceolate. Petals roundish obovate, entire, contracted into a claw, milk white, usually 
 exceeding the calyx-lobes. Stamens in staminate flowers numerous, longer than the 
 receptacle, in pistillate flowers more or less obsolete. Receptacle hairy, styles rather long. 
 Fruit 1-1.5 cm across, bright scarlet, subglobose, usually with a smooth neck underneath 
 the spreading calyx, with the achenes set in deep pits, sweet and juicy.
