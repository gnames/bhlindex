This old variety was in its day one of the most productive early strawberries. It was 
 a favorite in western New York and in the Mississippi Valley, especially valued as a good 
 pollinizer for other early sorts. It was also the most resistant to drouth of any of the 
 standard strawberries and the fruits held their size throughout a long picking season. 
 The variety is being discarded, however, because the fruits run small, are not very firm and 
 are rather poor in quality. It is best adapted to heavy soils. This variety originated 
 in 18S1 with Beder Wood, Moline, Illinois. Mr. Wood sent plants to friends in Iowa for 
 trial, whence the variety fell into the hands of John Racster of Davenport, who introduced 
 it under his own name in 1 890. Later the sort was sent out as Beder Wood. The American 
 Pomological Society listed the variety in its catalog of recommended fruits in 1897.
