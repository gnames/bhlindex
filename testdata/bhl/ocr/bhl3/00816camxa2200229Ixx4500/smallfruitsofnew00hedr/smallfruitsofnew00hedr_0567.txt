The berries of Boquet are large, blimt-conic, and borne in compact clusters at the 
 ends of the fruit-stems. The color is a uniform light red, and the flesh is well colored to 
 the center. The fruits are large, sweet, refreshing and much above the average for their 
 season. The crop ripens midway between Beacon and Bliss, early and late sorts sent out 
 by this Station. The fruits ship and keep well. The plants are vigorous, productive, 
 healthy, withstand drouths but unfortunately do not develop as many runners as growers 
 like for rapid propagation. This is a cross between Chesapeake and Pan American made 
 at this Station, the seeds being borne in 191 1; introduced by the New York State Fruit 
 Testing Association in 1923.
