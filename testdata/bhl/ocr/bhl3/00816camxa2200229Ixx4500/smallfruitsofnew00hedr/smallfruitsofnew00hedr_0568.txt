This old sort, at one time much grown in New York, is now being discarded because 
 the plants are very susceptible to leaf diseases. It is still a leading variety about Los 
 Angeles, California, where the berries ripen from early spring to late autumn. In New York 
 fruit and plants suffer much from drouth. Brandywine is a very ornamental straw- 
 berry with its dark green foliage, large blossoms and handsome fruits. It is still grown in 
 home gardens in the Hudson River Valley. This variety originated with E. C. Ingram, 
 West Chester, Pennsylvania, in 1889; introduced in 1895. Its parentage is supposed to
