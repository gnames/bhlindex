Bubach No. 5. 4. Rural N. Y. 47:195, 460. 1888. 

A quarter of a century ago Bubach was a standard sort in New York, but was dis- 
 carded chiefly because the plants are not good plant makers, the berries are soft, irregular 
 in shape, and do not ship well. The plants are very productive on heavy soils. The berries 
 are large, handsome, of very good quality and hold their color well when canned. This 
 variety was originated by J. G. Bubach, Princeton, Illinois, in 1882. It was introduced 
 about 1886 as Bubach No. 5 to distinguish it from several other seedlings originated by 
 Mr. Bubach. In 1889 the variety was added to the truit list of the American Pomological 
 Society. Bubach, Jr., introduced about 1901 and Improved Bubach introduced in 191 1 
 do not di!"l"er materially from this Bubach.
