 Connecticut. It was placed in the American Pomological Society's recommended fruit 
 list in 1879. This variety was once a prime favorite in many parts of America because of 
 productive plants adapted to a wide range of soils, but is now little grown because of poor 
 quality and small berries. Imperfect. Plants very numerous, vigorous, healthy only in 
 the most favorable locations, otherwise rusts badly, very productive; fruit-stems of medium 
 length and thickness, erect; calyx easily detached; fruit medium in size, round-conic, glossy
