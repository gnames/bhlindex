High quality and handsome appearance of the berries make Dunlap a favorite for the 
 garden and local markets in the northern states east of the Rocky Mountains. In some 
 localities of this great region it is grown almost exclusively. The faults are that the berries 
 are often too soft to ship well and many of them are small. The plants are hardy, 
 healthy, and productive, but sometimes produce too many runners. Howard is taking 
 the place of Dunlap in many parts of the East. Dunlap originated about 1890 with 
 J. R. Reasoner, Urbana, Illinois; introduced in 1899 by M. Crawford, Cuyahoga Falls, 
 Ohio; entered in the fruit catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1909; parent- 
 age uncertain but possibly a seedling of Warfield.

 number of berries but lacking in measured yield; leaves of medium size and color, thin, 
 glossy. Flowers earh* midseason ; petals 5-8 ; stamens medium in number ; receptacle small. 
 Fruit medium early, season short ; fruit-stems long, slender, semi-erect ; pedicels long, slender ;
