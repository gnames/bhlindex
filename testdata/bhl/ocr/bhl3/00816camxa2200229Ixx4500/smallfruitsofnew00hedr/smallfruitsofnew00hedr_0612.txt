THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

Excelsior, i. Ohio Sta. Bui. 154:35- 1904- 2, N. Y. Sta. Bid. 309:524. 1908. 

This old sort is still prized in many parts of the United States for its early, well-flavored 
 berries which keep and ship particularly well. It is one of the few varieties with a distinctly 
 sour berry that finds favor with consumers. The berries are small, dark red in color and 
 ripen very early. The small size and acid fruits are the chief defects of the product. The 
 plants are often injured by drouth and in many situations are improductive. They do 
 best grown in hills. Excelsior is giving way, in commercial plantations at least, to Howard. 
 This variety originated about 1890 with Louis Hubach, Judsonia, Arkansas; introduced 
 by J. C. Bauer of that place in 1892 ; parentage Hoffman by Wilson; added to the American 
 Pomological Society's fruit catalog in 1899. 

Perfect. Plants numerous, healthy, productive; leaves small, light green, dull, rugose, 
 Flowers very early, small; petals 6-8; stamens variable in number; receptacle small. 
 Fruit very early; fruit-stems short, prostrate; pedicels short, slender; calyx small, 
 variable in position, often discolored; sepals short, narrow; berries medium to small, 
 round-conic or globose; apex obtuse; color light to dark red, moderately glossy; seeds 
 sunken; flesh usually dark red but variable, firm, juicy, decidedly tart; quality fair. 

Excelsior (of Shaw), i. Rural N. Y. 55:498. 1896. 

Originated with James Shaw, South Hadley, Massachusetts; introduced in 1895; 
 supposed to be a cross between Duchess and Crescent. Plants productive; fruit large, 
 conical heart-shaped, soft; fair. 

Exquisite, i. Burbank Cat. 12. 1916-17. 

Raised about 19 10 by Luther Burbank, Santa Rosa, California, as a descendant of one 
 of his white seedling strawberries, a Chilian seedling, and Bubach. Perfect. Plants at 
 this Station, very few, weak, low growing and dwarfish, very unproductive, healthy; 
 flowers large, with the petal-edges recurved; fruit-stems short, erect; fruit variable in 
 size and shape, unattractive pale red; flesh soft, very white; very good; very late. 

Fae. I. Ohio Sta. Bui. 236:220, fig. 1912. 

Originated with W. J. Alt, Lancaster, Ohio; introduced in 1908. Imperfect. Plants 
 vigorous, productive; fruit large, blunt conical to broad wedge-shape, medium red; flesh 
 light red, juicy, firm; good; midseason. 

Fairdale. i. Md. Sta. Bui. 211:67. 1918. 

Originated in 1905 with J. G. Harrison & Sons, Berlin, Maryland. Perfect. Plants 
 moderately vigorous; berries large, roundish wedge-shaped, blunt, bright scarlet; flesh 
 light red, firm, juicy, subacid; fair; midseason. 

Fairfield, i. Ohio Sta. Bui. 146:32. 1903. 2. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 309:524. 1908. 

A chance seedling found in an old peach orchard about 1895 by Martin Johnson, Ctim- 
 berland County, New Jersey. Perfect. Station plants medivim in number, vigorous, 
 healthy, unproductive; fruit large, drops rapidly in size, round-conic to long-conic, glossy 
 light to dark red, mildly acid, medium firm, inferior in flavor; fair; early. Its earliness is 
 its greatest asset; disappointing in yield and flavor.
