 3. A''. Y. Sta. Bui. 276:70. 1906. 

Once widely grown, Glen Mary is still prized in New York and New England for its 
 productive plants and its handsome, well-flavored fruits. Several faults are causing it to 
 be discarded in many strawberry regions. These are: The fruit-stems are too slender to 
 hold the fruit off the ground; the foliage is susceptible to leaf-spot; the plants thrive only 
 on very heavy and very fertile soils ; and the blossoms are not self fertile, so that the fruits 
 are often malformed. Glen Mary is still largely cultivated in the Hudson River Valley 
 in this State. This sort was originated by J. A. Ingram, East Bradford, Pennsylvania, 
 about 1890 as a chance seedling; introduced by W. F. Allen, Salisbury, Maryland, in 1896; 
 placed in the American Pomological Society's fruit list in 1899. 

Semi-perfect. Plants rather small, fairly vigorous, sometimes injured by leaf-spot, 
 productive; leaves variable in size, dark green, thick, glossy, slightly rugose. Flowers 
 early, rather large; petals 6-7 ; stamens few; receptacle large. Fruit midseason; fruit-stems 
 variable in length and thickness, semi-erect to prostrate; pedicels long, thick; calyx medium 
 to large, flat or shghtly raised, often discolored; sepals long; berries large, irregular round- 
 conic; apex often poorly pollinated, misshapen, irregular, obtuse; color dull red, often 
 with whitish or light colored apex; seeds raised; flesh well colored to the center, firm, 
 juicy, mildly subacid; quality good.
