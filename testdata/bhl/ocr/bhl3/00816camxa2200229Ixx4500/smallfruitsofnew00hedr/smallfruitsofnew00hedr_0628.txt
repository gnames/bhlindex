Good Luck. I. A'^. Y. Sta. Bui. 309:527. 1908. 2. Ibid. 427:529, PI. 1916. 

The fruits of Good Luck are distinguished by flesh so finn that they are hardly sirr- 
 passed for shipping purposes. Moreover, they are large, handsome and very good in quality 
 for those who like a sprightly strawberry. Besides this slight acidity they have a very 
 distinctive flavor. Unfortunately the apex of the berries colors slowly so that much care 
 must be taken in picking to avoid green tips. The plants are unusually satisfactory, espe- 
 cially as they are not susceptible to leaf-spot, but they must not be set too closely as they 
 develop many runners. At the close of the season, especially in dry weather, the berries 
 run small and show too many seeds. Good Luck originated with Elwood Pedrick, Cumber- 
 land County, Maryland, in 1904; introduced in 1907 by W. F. Allen, Salisbury, Maryland. 
 In 1909 the American Pomological Society added the variety to its catalog list of fruits.
