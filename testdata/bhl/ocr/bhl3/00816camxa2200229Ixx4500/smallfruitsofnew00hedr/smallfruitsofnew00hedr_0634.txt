At the beginning of this century Haverland was considered about the best strawberry 
 for home use and local markets and is still to be found in many gardens in the New England 
 states. The berries are too soft and too light in color for distant markets. The crop ripens 
 over a long season. The plants are very productive and the variety has a reputation of 
 being very hardy, and its blossoms are said to be seldom injured by frost. The clusters 
 are so heavy as to lie on the ground so that a mulch is always necessary for this sort. Dunlap 
 makes the most satisfactory pollinizer. The variety originated in 1882 as a cross between 
 Crescent and Sharpless with B. H. Haverland, Cincinnati, Ohio; introduced in 1887. 
 The American Pomological Society added the variety to its list of recommended fruits 
 in 1889.
