THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 46 1 

Hovey was the first good strawberry to originate in America. It was originated by 
 C. M. Hovey, Boston, Massachusetts, in 1834 and was introduced in 1838. While it was 
 valued for home use rather than for market, it was a standard sort in many localities as 
 late as 1880. According to the American Pomological Society the variety was being grown 
 in sixteen states in i88g. The society included Hovey in its fruit catalog from 1852 to 
 1897. The variety has been gradually supplanted by better sorts so that it has been practi- 
 cally lost to cultivation since the close of the nineteenth centurJ^ For a further discussion 
 of this variety see page 367. 

Imperfect to semi-perfect. Plants numerous, large, vigorous, upright, medium in 
 height, productive; leaves light to dark green, large, smooth, gloss\". Flowers small; 
 petals roundish, slightly overlapping, cupped; stamens few, imperfectly developed. Fruit 
 midseason; fniit-stems intermediate in length and thickness; pedicels long, slender; calyx 
 very small, reflexed; berries medium to large, round-conic, with a short neck; apex obtuse;

Probably Howard is being more highly spoken of than any other strawberry- recently 
 introduced. It is yet too soon to tell just what place it will take in home and commercial 
 strawberry growing in New York. The berry is the type of that of the well-known Dunlap ; 
 ripens as early, is a lighter red, and the calyx has not the red tinge that Dunlap often has. 
 The plants are more productive, the picking season is longer, and the berries are larger. 
 Probably Howard will replace Dvmlap which has long been the standard early berry in 
 many parts of the countrj-. This is the most promising of the large number of seedlings 
 originated by A. B. Howard, Belchertown, Massachusetts. It was introduced in 1909. 
 Since that time the variety has been widely advertised by the R. M. Kellogg Company, 
 Three Rivers, Michigan, as Kellogg's Premier, stock of which had been secured from 
 E. A. Riehl, Alton, Illinois. 

Perfect. Plants numerous, vigorous, healthy,* productive for an early berry; leaves 
 thick, dark green, dull. Flowers medium early, variable in size, cup-shaped; petals large, 
 5-9, crinkly; receptacle small. Fruit early, ripening period long, holds up in size; fruit- 
 stems short, prostrate; pedicels long, slender; calyx large, flat or sHghtly raised, somewhat 
 leafy, well colored; sepals long, broad; berries large, long-conic to wedge, the largest berries 
 furrowed on each side; apex pointed; color attractive glossy red; seeds sunken; flesh well 
 colored to the center, juicy, pleasantly sprightly, firm; quality good.
