Joe Johnson. 3.761(^.447:71. 1918. 

The outstanding merits of Joe are large, handsome, well-flavored berries, which are 
 suitable for either home use or the markets. The plants are satisfactory in all respects 
 except in hardiness, so that the variety is a favorite only in the comparatively warm straw- 
 berry regions of Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware, and eastern New York. The plants are 
 exceedingly productive, therefore the variety is a very desirable kind for intensive culture. 
 Joe originated with J. H. Black, Son & Company, Hightstown, New Jersey ; introduced by 
 this company in 1899.
