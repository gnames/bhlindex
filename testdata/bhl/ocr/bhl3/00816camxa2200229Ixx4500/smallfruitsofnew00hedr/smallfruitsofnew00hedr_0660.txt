This variety is grown almost exclusively in some parts of the South in commercial 
 plantations. It usually fails in all the northern states. Its popularity is due to adaptability 
 to a great diversity of soils, to plants which are fairly free from disease, and to the firm flesh 
 and deep red color of the berries, the last two characters fitting it for shipping and canning. 
 The quality is scarcely above mediocre, and the hulls do not part readily from the berries, â€” 
 serious defects for a home plantation. Klondike originated with R. L. Cloud, Independ- 
 ence, Louisiana, as a cross between Pickerproof and Hoffman; introduced in 1901; placed 
 in the American Pomological Society's fruit catalog in 1909.
