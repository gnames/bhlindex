Late Stevens is not so desirable as several other late varieties in New York, but in 
 parts of New Jersey and Delaware it is highly esteemed for both commercial and home 
 plantations. In New York the plants are not always productive, the foliage is Susceptible 
 to mildew and leaf-spot and the fruits lack uniformity in shape and size. Neither plants 
 nor fruits stand drouth well, under which condition the berries show the seeds too plainly. 
 This variety was originated by Arthur Stevens, Bridgeton, New Jersey, in 1897; introduced 
 in 1903. The American Pomological Society added the variety to its list of recommended 
 fruits in 1909.
