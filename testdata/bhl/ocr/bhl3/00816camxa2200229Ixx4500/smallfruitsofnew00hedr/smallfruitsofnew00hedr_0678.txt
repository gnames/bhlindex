Were it not for its verj^ exacting soil and climatic requirements, Marshall would be 
 considered the standard of excellence among strawberries in both fruit and plant in northern 
 regions. The plants require a heavy, rich soil and intensive culture to force the foliage 
 sufficiently to withstand the leaf-spot. Under good conditions, however, very large 
 crops of exceedingly handsome and splendid-flavored berries, are produced. Under 
 unfavorable conditions, which occur all too often, the berries are small, seedy, irregular 
 and unattractive. This variety originated in 1890 as a chance seedling, with Marshall 
 F. Ewell, Marshfield Hills, Massachusetts, who introduced it in 1893. 

Perfect. Plants medium in nimiber, tall, large, usually vigorous, susceptible to leaf- 
 spot, variable in yield; leaves large, light to dark green, roundish, thick, rugose, glossy. 
 Flowers midseason, large; petals 5-6, small; stamens numerous; receptacle intermediate 
 in size. Fruit midseason; fruit-stems thick, prostrate; pedicels long, thick; calyx sometimes 
 discolored, depressed ; sepals medium in length and width ; berries large to very large, irregu- 
 larly round-conic to wedge, the surface often irregularly furrowed and misshapen; apex 
 obtuse; color glossy dark, deep red; seeds raised to slightly sunken; flesh dark red to the 
 center, juicy, variable in firmness, pleasantly sprightly, aromatic ; qualitj- very good to best. 

Marshall Improved, i. N. Y. Sia. Bui. 447: yi. 1918. 

The origin of this variety is obscure. E. W. Townsend & Sons, Salisbury, Maryland, 
 introduced the sort about 1913, having purchased the original plant three years earlier 
 from a nursery canvasser. It is inferior to Marshall at this Station. Perfect. Plants 
 healthy, medium in number, yield, and vigor; fruit-stems short, thick, erect; fruit large 
 to medium, irregularly furrowed, roimd-conic, dull light red, medium in juiciness and firm- 
 ness, subacid, whitish at the center, fair; early.
