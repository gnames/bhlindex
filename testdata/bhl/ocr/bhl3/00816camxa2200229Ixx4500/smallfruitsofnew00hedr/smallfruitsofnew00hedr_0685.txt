Never of much account in the North, Michel was for many years the standard ship- 
 ping sort for the South. It is still grown in several southern states as an early market 
 variety, but is being discarded. The plants develop far too many runners, so that a patch 
 of Michel becomes a wilderness. The fruits are small, poor in color and not of high quality. 
 Extreme earliness and ability to cover a large area, sometimes an asset, are its chief charac- 
 teristics. Excelsior which ripens at the same time is under most conditions a better variety. 
 This sort originated in 1886 with George Michel, Judsonia, Arkansas; introduced in 1889; 
 added to the American Pomological Society's list of recommended fruits in 1897. The 
 variet}^ is a chance seedling with Crescent as a probable parent.
