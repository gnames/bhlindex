Parker Earle Improved. 4. Mich. Sta. Bui. 189:114, 116. 1901. 

This \'ariety now has little but historic value. It represents a somewhat distinct 
 type in plant and fruit and was in its day one of the old standards so that it is here included 
 among the major sorts. The variety was never a general favorite in New York, but was 
 largely grown in several states of the Middle West. Its half-developed fruits are green; 
 just before ripening they become dead white which rapidly turns to glossy red. The 
 berries usually have the appearance of having been cut squarely off at the tip end. Parker 
 Earle originated in 1886 with James Nimon, Denison, Texas, as a seedling of Crescent; 
 introduced in 1889 by T. V. Munson of Denison; added to the recommended fruit list of 
 the American Pcmological Society in 1891. 

Perfect. Plants medium to few, tall, vigorous, healthy, productive; leaves rather 
 large, dull, rugose. Flowers midseason, medium to small; petals 5-7, smallish; stamens 
 numerous; receptacle small. Fruit late midseason to late; fruit-stems short, prostrate; 
 pedicels long, thick; calyx raised, reflexed, easily detached, well colored; sepals long, 
 narrow; berries medium to large, conic, often truncate at the apex, although usually some- 
 what pointed; color glossy bright red; seeds raised; flesh light red, medium in firmness, 
 juicy, mildly subacid; good to very good.
