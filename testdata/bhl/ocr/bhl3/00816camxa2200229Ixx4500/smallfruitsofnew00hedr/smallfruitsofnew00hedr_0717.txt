Gibson. 3. N. Y. Sta. Bui. 447:70. 1918. 

This variety is occasionally found in strawberry plantations in western New York, 
 but is more generally grown in Michigan and in the Middle West. Its outstanding charac- 
 ters are hardy and productive plants and large, handsome berries which are firm enough 
 to keep well and reach markets in good condition. Many growers believe that there 
 are two if not three varieties under this name. Gibson and Parsons are very similar if not 
 identical. Almost without question Gibson is Pocomoke, and we have listed it as a 
 synonym, a procedure which many growers will dispute. The variety originated with 
 E. H. Hamblin, Pittsville, Maryland, as a chance seedling; introduced about 1902. A 
 variety introduced from Michigan in 191 1 under the name Gibson, has proved identical 
 with Pocomoke.

 somewhat rugose. Flowers early, large; petals 7-9, large, crinkly; stamens numerous; 
 receptacle large. Fruit midseason; fruit-stems thick, semi-erect; pedicels long; calyx large, 
 raised, leafy; sepals broad; berries above medium in size, round-conic to long-conic, necked; 
 apex usually pointed but variable ; color attractive, glossy red ; seeds raised ; flesh red through- 
 out, juicy, very firm, tart or sprightly; fair in quality.

Originated in 1914 as a seedling of Goldsborough by A. J. Schild, Ionia, Michigan;

 depressed; seeds raised; fruit very large to medium, retains size well, irregular wedge,
