Of the score or more everbearing strawberries introduced in recent years, Progressive 
 is now probably the best known. It is a favorite because of the hardiness, healthiness and 
 productiveness of the plants and the handsome, well-flavored fruits. The plants produce 
 a crop in the spring as well as in the fall. Progressive seems to do well only in northern 
 climates and, as with all the double-cropping varieties, is often very capricious in bearing 
 habits. This is a cross between Dunlap and Pan American, which originated with Harlow 
 Rockhill, Conrad, Iowa, in 1908; placed on the market in 191 2. 

Perfect. Plants medium to numerous, vigorous, healthy, productive; autumn- 
 bearing; leaves dark green, thick, smooth, glossy. Flowers early, medium in size; petals 
 5-6 ; receptacle small . Fruit early ; fruit-stems thick , much branched ; pedicels long, slender ; 
 calyx flat, reflexed, often with a pinkish tinge; sepals narrow; berries vary considerably 
 in size from large to small, blunt- wedge to blunt-conic; apex obtuse; color glossy dark red; 
 seeds raised; flesh well colored throughout, firm, subacid, mild; quality good. 

Prolific. I. A^. Y. Sta. Bui. 309:542. 1908. 2. Ibid. 364:194, PI. 1913. 

This variety was originated on the groimds of the New York Agricultural Experiment 
 Station and so has been under the eyes of the authors of this text for several years. It 
 would rank among the very best strawberries were it not for susceptibility to leaf-spot 
 which takes too great toll in most localities. The plants are very vigorous and productive, 
 and the fruits are large, handsome and well flavored. For those who can control leaf-spot 
 by spraying, and for home gardens, Prolific is a most valuable strawberry. It originated on 
 the grounds of this Station in 1899 as a cross batween Sample and Marshall; introduced in 
 1908. 

Perfect. Plants nimierous, tall, vigorous, susceptible to leaf-spot, very productive; 
 leaves large, dark green, thick. Flowers midseason, medium to large; petals 6-8, large; 
 stamens numerous. Fruit midseason, ripening period long, picks easily; fruit-stems stout, 
 semi-erect; pedicels intermediate in length and thickness; calyx depressed, variable in color; 
 sepals short, broad; berries large, retain size well throughout the season, round-conic to 
 wedge-conic; apex obtuse; color handsome, glossy bright red; seeds raised; flesh well colored 
 throughout, firm, juicy, pleasantly acid, aromatic; quality good.
