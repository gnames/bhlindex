For a quarter of a century Warfield was a standard market variety in all of the northern 
 commercial strawberry centers, from which it has been discarded except in parts of the 
 Middle West. The variety came into prominence because of its hardy, healthy, productive 
 plants. The fruits were liked by shippers, consumers, and canners ; they retain their color, 
 shape, and flavor very well under the most trying conditions for this crop. The berries 
 often run small, unless the plants are grown on rich soils and given high culture. Dunlap 
 is the best variety for cross pollination. The greatest defect of Warfield is the small size 
 of its berries in light or poor soils and in dry weather. This variety, for many years a 
 standard, originated as a chance seedling about 1882 with C. B. Warfield, Sandoval, Illinois. 
 It may be a cross between Crescent and Wilson; introduced in 1885; added to the fruit 
 catalog of the American Pomological Society in 1891.
