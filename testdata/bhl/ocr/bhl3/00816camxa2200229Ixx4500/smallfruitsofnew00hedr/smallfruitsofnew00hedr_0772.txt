c6o THE SMALL FRUITS OF NEW YORK 

BIBLIOGRAPHY AND REFERENCES, WITH ABBREVIATIONS USED 

The list of books which follows contains all American pomological 
 works in which the several small fruits are discussed at any length. No 
 attempt has been made to include botanical works. Only such European 
 bocks are listed as were found useful in writing The Small Fruits 
 of New York. Only periodicals are recorded to which references are made 
 in the text of the book. The reports and bulletins of experiment stations 
 and horticultural societies are not included since the abbreviations used for 
 such publications will be recognized by all. The date of copyright has been 
 â– preferred to that of publication, though sometimes it has been necessary 
 to use the latter, as when there were several editions from the same 
 copyright.
